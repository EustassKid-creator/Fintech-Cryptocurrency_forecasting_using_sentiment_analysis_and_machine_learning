2022-12-31T12:05:39.000Z,BTC,NEWS,MicroStrategy sold its Bitcoin for good reason,"<p>Some eyebrows were raised when Microstrategy sold a part of its Bitcoin holdings, even though the company then bought more. A tax loophole was the reason.</p>
Sell at a loss then immediately repurchase
<p>Crypto investors can reduce their capital gains tax in 2022 by selling their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchasing them, thanks to a regulatory distinction that crypto assets have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This strategy was recently used by business intelligence firm MicroStrategy, which bought 2,395 bitcoin on Wednesday, sold a portion at a loss, and bought 810 bitcoin just two days later.</p>
Crypto still an asset and not a security
<p>Unlike other securities, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not consider crypto to be a security, but rather an asset, which means that certain tax laws, such as the ""wash rule,"" do not apply to it. This allows investors to sell crypto at a net loss and buy it back instantly while still being able to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other investors who sell securities for a net loss at the end of the tax year can deduct up to $3,000 from their capital gains tax and carry any additional losses over to the next tax year.</p>
IRS could change its policy
<p>Crypto investors will continue to have this advantage as long as the IRS maintains its current policy of treating crypto as assets rather than securities. This allows investors to sell their crypto assets at a loss and immediately repurchase them, allowing them to claim the loss on their tax filings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, the IRS has not made any official statements on this matter, and it is possible that they may change their policy in the future. It is worth noting that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) considers many widely-traded cryptocurrencies to be securities, which has been a source of controversy in the crypto community.</p>

The crypto market witnessed sluggish price action due to limited trading activity during the holiday season. Traders expect the second-largest cryptocurrency, <a href=""https://coingape.com/tag/Ethereum"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Ethereum</a> to also end the year above $1,200.</p>
<p>In the weekly timeframe, the Bitcoin price action has been in a downward trend since the ATH in November 2021. The BTC price failed to capitalize on the descending channel breakout in October 2022 due to the collapse of the crypto exchange <a href=""https://coingape.com/tag/ftx"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">FTX</a>.</p>
<p><img decoding=""async"" class=""aligncenter  wp-image-133737"" src=""https://cdn.coingape.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/31162114/BTCUSDT_2022-12-31_16-21-04.png"" alt=""Bitcoin Price"" width=""720"" height=""438"" /></p>
<p>Bitcoin price is currently trading at $16,553, trading sideways after recovering from a fall below the crucial support level on Friday. The 24-hour low and high are $16,408 and $16,610, respectively. Thus, the price has recovered just 1% in the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://coingape.com/glossary/rsi-relative-strength-index/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">RSI</a> is at 33. Therefore, the Bitcoin price shows weakness and should continue to move sideways in the next few weeks. The Exponential Moving Average also shows a bearish price trend in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Bollinger Bands indicates the formation of narrow bands in the weekly timeframe. Thus, traders may keep away from trading due to decreased volatility. The end of the Squeeze may likely see Bitcoin price moving higher.</p>
<p>According to UTXO distribution on-chain data, the 1-3 months retail investors (green) maintain a positive sentiment, but longer timeframes like 3-5 years holders (pink) clearly show de-risking. Moreover, the short-term traders 3M-6M (orange) are still reeling from heavy losses. However, the institutional level 2Y-3Y (deep blue) shows signs of accumulation.</p>

However, XRP holders’ have tried to hold the fort in a hope that the outcome of <a href=""https://coingape.com/tag/ripple-vs-sec/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">the XRP lawsuit</a> will land in the favor of Ripple. However, an attorney linked to the case has stated that XRP holders are the biggest loser here.</p>
<h2>SEC contradicting its stance in XRP lawsuit?</h2>
<p>US SEC, <a href=""https://coingape.com/glossary/amicus-curiae/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Amicus Curiae</a>, Ripple, and Defendants have submitted their briefs and opposition to brief in order to attain a <a href=""https://coingape.com/xrp-lawsuit-verdict-or-settlement-xrp-lawyer-to-drop-prediction/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">summary judgment in the XRP lawsuit</a>. However, the commission again brought up Hinman’s speech docs and related emails in the latest submission despite facing backlash from the court.</p>
<p>John Deaton, Amicus Curiae in the Ripple Lawsuit stated that XRP holders have been the biggest losers in the XRP lawsuit. It had happened despite the regulator’s mandate to protect customers. In his writ of mandamus, he mentioned that the SEC’s take on XRP constitutes a security that is unprecedented in over 70 years of Securities law.</p>
<p><a rel='nofollow'  href=""https://twitter.com/JohnEDeaton1/status/1608887502949208067"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow noopener"">He added</a> that this stance contradicts previous guidance by authorities like the Howey test. XRP lawyer claimed that anything can be packaged as a security by an investment contract. Meanwhile, this cannot make the underlying asset alone a security.</p>
<h2>Ripple case to end in a settlement?</h2>
<p>Coingape reported that the <a href=""https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-to-end-in-settlement-whales-move-618-million-xrp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">XRP lawyer launched a Twitter Poll</a> asking users whether they believe that the summary judgment would suggest a settlement or goes to verdict. However, almost 60% of the voters believe that there will be a settlement in the case.</p>
<p><a href=""https://coingape.com/price/xrp-price/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">XRP prices</a> have registered a drop of almost 60% on the year to date (YTD) basis. While the biggest digital assets like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) have shed 66% and 69% respectively. However, Ripple’s native crypto has turned out to be the<a href=""https://coingape.com/xrp-news-ripple-lawsuit-to-end-in-settlement-whales-move-618-million-xrp/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener""> top choice among the crypto whales</a> over the past few weeks.</p>

2022-12-31T10:51:22.000Z,BTC,NEWS,Ex Meta exec says crypto winter to end in 2025,"<p>David Marcus, advocate of the Bitcoin Lightning Network, thinks there is more pain to come in 2023 as market tries to recover from bad actors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Marcus is the CEO and co-founder of Lightspark, and ran Payments/Crypto and Messenger at Meta. He also led PayPal, and has built three startups. On Friday he published his thoughts for the future in a Medium article.</p>
Recession plus obsolete workforces
<p>The experienced executive is not bullish in the short to medium term on the economy nor on crypto. He thinks that a full-blown recession is approaching, probably caused by the Federal Reserve raising rates as they seek to tame inflation.</p>
<p>He believes that large tech companies are going to realise that they can cut their workforces drastically, and do more with few people. He thinks that AI will &ldquo;see the beginning of a Cambrian explosion&rdquo;, that will serve to automate many work areas, and also lead to human obsoletion across many industries.</p>
Crypto will recover
<p>As for crypto, he is of the opinion that the sector will need a couple of years to recover from the bad actors that have plagued it. He thinks that regulation will need time to be responsibly developed and implemented.</p>
<p>He sees a sea change in crypto and states:</p>

<p>&ldquo;In crypto, years of greed will make room for real-world applications. The years of creating a token out of thin air and making millions are over. The music has stopped. We&rsquo;re back to our regular programming of having to create real value and solving real world problems.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the solving of these problems he expects to see:</p>

<p>&ldquo;key innovations in the areas of payments, asset securitization, DeFi, zero-knowledge applications including proof of reserves and layer 1 scaling solutions, and a renewed development energy and interest on the Bitcoin network.&rdquo;</p>

Sceptical on regulation
<p>Once more on regulation, Marcus is not very hopeful that the regulators will get it right. He believes that new regulation is necessary for digital assets and crypto, contrary to the belief of Gary Gensler, chair of the SEC, who believes that crypto must be shoehorned into existing regulation. He says:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sadly, I&rsquo;ve become increasingly skeptical of our ability to reach consensus on legislative or regulatory approaches that achieve the right balance in these areas. I think we will therefore see more of the same in 2023 with increased responsibility on leaders of industries to do what they believe is right in the vacuum left by our deadlocked legislative system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he is of the firm belief that &ldquo;destruction comes with an opportunity to rebuild anew&rdquo;, and that despite an extremely challenging environment, digital assets and crypto will come out of this next period stronger and better.</p>

2022-12-31T07:40:00.000Z,BTC,NEWS,Valkyrie Submits Proposal To Manage Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust,"<p>Crypto Assets Manager Valkyrie Investments has unveiled a proposal to become the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) is the world&rsquo;s largest Bitcoin fund and has been trading at a record discount compared to the price of BTC.&nbsp;</p>
The Valkyrie Proposal&nbsp;
<p>In a blog post published this week, Valkyrie Investments proposed becoming the sponsor and manager of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which will see the company manage its much larger rival. The Nashville-based asset manager, which manages around $180 million in assets, announced the launch of the Valkyrie Opportunistic Fund, which is looking to take advantage of the significant discount in the value of the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan is considered extremely ambitious, considering the fact that the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust manages over $10 billion in assets, compared to Valkyrie&rsquo;s $180 million. The Valkyrie fund plans to increase its holdings of GBTC, enabling the company to realize the true value of the underlying Bitcoin for its investors. In a letter posted on its website, co-founder and CIO of Valkyrie Investments, Steven McClurg, stated,&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We understand that Grayscale has played an important role in the development and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem with the launch of GBTC, and we respect the team and the work that they have done. However, in light of recent events involving Grayscale and its family of affiliated companies, it is time for a change. Valkyrie is the best company to manage GBTC to ensure its investors are treated fairly.&rdquo;</p>

A Long Shot?
<p>In the proposal, Valkyrie highlighted several ways through which they aim to improve the current management of GBTC. The fund stated that it aims to facilitate redemptions at a net asset value (NAV) for investors through a Regulation M filing, allowing investors to redeem their shares at a fair price. The proposal also seeks to lower the fee to 75 basis points, compared to the current 200 basis points, and offer redemptions in BTC and cash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, a move to manage and sponsor the trust could be a long shot, considering Grayscale filings have stated that shareholders can play no part in the management or control of the trust. Additionally, they also have limited voting rights. It also states that no amendments to the trust agreement that could impact the interest of shareholders can be made without a vote of at least a majority (50%) of the shares.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Valkyrie also noted that it has a proven track record of success, running its own Bitcoin Trust since January 2021. It added that it has launched a host of Bitcoin-related ETFs and was, along with VanEck and ProShares, one of the firms to launch the first Bitcoin futures ETFs in 2021.&nbsp;</p>
Trading Below Value&nbsp;
<p>Currently, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust is trading around 50% below the value of the Bitcoin it holds. This is because of the structure of the GBTC, where while new shares can be created, they cannot be destroyed as demand for the trust&rsquo;s underlying Bitcoin faces a bit of a downturn, leading to a discount in the net asset value. On its part, Grayscale tried to convert the GBTC into an exchange-traded fund (ETF) which would allow for share redemptions.</p>
<p>However, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) denied the application to convert GBTC into a spot bitcoin ETF. Grayscale was highly critical of the move by the SEC, calling it arbitrary, capricious, and discriminatory, and filed a lawsuit against the agency.&nbsp;</p>

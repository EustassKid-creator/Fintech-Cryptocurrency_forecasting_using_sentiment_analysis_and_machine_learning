cardano,Opinion,Which Way for Blockchain Standards in 2017?,"Distributed ledger (aka blockchain) technology is crying out for standards. Mutual distributed ledgers (MDLs), my  preferred term  for the tech, hold immense promise, providing multi-organizational databases with a super audit trail, owned by no one and everyone. Hence, the term ""immutable ledgers"", ""widely distributed"" and ""mutual"". It's hardly surprising, then, that developers see a host of opportunities to transform business practices and offer new services, and businesses (although slightly less clear about the vision) see a host of opportunities to cooperate where it has been difficult before. But businesses have been here before. In the 1980s, electronic data interchange ( EDI ) was all the rage. EDI gave businesses standards for data communications, typically about business processes, facilitating the exchange of business information such as purchase orders, invoices or shipping notices. A landmark framework was eventually even put forth by the United Nations, the Electronic Data Interchange for Administration, Commerce and Transport ( EDIFACT ), in 1987. Then again, in the 1990s, eXtensible Markup Language (XML) was all the rage. The then-brand-new HTML (HypterText Markup Language) of 1991 was not rich enough to transfer business documentation, so a movement for an extension began. (XML is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents so they are both human-readable and machine-readable). HTML and XML are older than they look. IBM's GML (Generalized Markup Language), developed in the 1960s by Charles Goldfarb, Edward Mosher and Raymond Lorie, begat SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) as an ISO standard in 1986, that in turn begat HTML in 1991, and XML around 1996. Most EDI initiatives transformed into XML initiatives as the World Wide Web gained momentum. A leading example is SWIFT and ISO 20022, which defines XML financial messages. So, what has all this to do with MDLs? A lot. Anywhere there is a big pile of XML standards (even better, if they were originally EDI standards), there is a huge, pent-up demand for organizations to communicate with each other. However, along with technical difficulties, one of the big problems preventing such communication has been the need for a central third-party to control the communications. A single third party can create a natural monopoly it might abuse, and MDLs remove much of that risk by providing a technology that no one owns and that everyone can keep their own copy of in the event of technical failure. Businesses hunger to talk with one another without a central third party – MDLs are the ideal tool for this and can also re-energize XML initiatives. And there are a lot of them. ACORD for insurers, essDOCS and Bolero for shipping and trade. And on and on … One standard to rule them all But what about progress so far? In April 2016, Standards Australia, a non-government, not-for-profit standards organization proposed that the International Standards Organization (ISO) extend its mandate to include blockchain as a ""new field of technical activity"". Later  in September , ISO appointed Standards Australia to manage the secretariat of an international technical committee for the development of blockchain standards. This is worthy, but what is really needed? MDLs will realize their potential to contribute to economic growth when the technology is widely diffused and used, and diffusion itself results from a series of individual decisions to begin using the new technology, decisions that are often the result of a comparison of the uncertain benefits of the technology with the uncertain costs of adopting it. It is diffusion, rather than invention or innovation, that ultimately determines the pace of economic growth and the rate of change of productivity, and until many users adopt MDL technology it may contribute little to our well-being. The key to ensuring widespread diffusion is ensuring that MDLs are viewed as safe, reliable technology. Regulators have two primary levers they can use: regulation and standards. Regulation is sometimes a knee-jerk response by policy makers to perceived risk. While it can be speedy and authoritative, the process to create regulations can be distanced from the participants, resulting in unnecessary burdens or unforeseen consequences. Standards, if implemented as part of a voluntary standards market with strict certification and accreditation can be highly effective – but strict certification and accreditation are essential. Continuing on from work in 2014 and 2015, Long Finance researched the need for MDL standards during 2016. Sponsored by the States of Alderney, PwC and the Cardano Foundation, the research aimed to answer four questions: What are the potential risks associated with future widespread use of mutual distributed ledgers, and what are their implications? How do distributed ledgers fit within existing regulatory frameworks, and are existing laws sufficient to cover the activities supported by distributed ledgers, or is new legislation is needed? Would MDLs benefit from the development of standards, and which sectors and services might need MDLs most? What different paths could be taken to create standards? The study consulted over 80 people involved in MDLs, looking at a variety of areas where the technology might increase risk. Potential Risk Areas For MDLs graph Three risk areas occupied the thoughts of the majority of the practitioners: Governance:  Organizations will need to put in place many inter-organizational structures to manage MDLs. How will errors be corrected? Who will have authority to write to the ledger? Will there be a central authority who can make changes to the records, or change the entire system to help it evolve? Liability and responsibility:  How should high risk activities such as AML and KYC be handled? Who will 'carry the can' if things go wrong? What systems are in place to manage and resolve disputes? Taxonomies:  What exactly is any specific MDL in front of a regulator: permissioned or unpermissioned, public or private, opaque or transparent, proof-of-work or proof-of-stake? What are the tolerances and performance capabilities? These questions are of pressing concern to users but, as this is a rapidly developing field, a common language has yet to develop. The research was  published  in November 2016 as "" The Missing Links In The Chains? Mutual Distributed Ledger (aka blockchain) Standards "", and concluded that in the majority of cases MDLs will support existing services that have existing processes and support technologies. There will be a rich standards and regulation landscape that they must negotiate in order to be fit for purpose. It found, too, that simpler, less regulated domains are more likely to adopt MDL approaches earlier, particularly where MDLs can solve an unaddressed problem (eg: know-your-customer, anti-money-laundering, ultimate-beneficial-ownership in financial services), and offer a difference to traditional central third party approaches (eg: meeting EU General Data Protection Regulation for the 'right to be forgotten' surrounding identity documentation). Are new regulations needed for MDLs? MDLs will, in the majority of cases, be deployed into existing regulatory environments. Unless regulations specifically stipulate the use of third-party intermediaries, they are likely to be sufficient to cover the activities supported by MDLs. Further, MDLs can piggy-back on existing XML work. In a sense, the MDL is merely another way of messaging, but without a central third party and with a ‘super audit trail’. Not so fast Another notable conclusion was that some standards could constrain innovation too early. While existing thematic standards, such as ISO 9000 for quality management or ISO 31000 for risk management, were probably flexible enough to cover the use of MDLs, there were three salient gaps: Taxonomies and performance standards  need to be outcome-focused sets of definitions and characteristics, so that regulators and potential purchasers can assess MDLs based on their outputs, rather than the mechanics of how they operate. Data governance and liability standards  need to pay fundamental attention to the civil liberty implications of data aggregation, sharing and mining. Commercial governance and liability standards  need to structure how organizations link legally and contractually with MDLs. So how could an appropriate voluntary standards market be established? Three potential routes present themselves: ISO standards  developed at a global level with national standards institutions and wider stakeholders. Standards Australia are considering this route on technical standards for blockchains. ISO standards carry immense credibility because of their well-established model for certification and accreditation, but the ISO path can be a long one. Publicly Available Specifications (PASs)  created with a national standards institution, perhaps later rolled-out as an ISO standard. This route has the advantage of creating standards which are close to the industries they are intended for, resulting in cost-effective and streamlined solutions. Open process standards  work up from industry participants, but can suffer from a tendency to certification and accreditation procedures, the end result can lack credibility. "" The Missing Links in the Chains "" confirms that the establishment of a voluntary standards market may be beneficial in promoting MDLs by providing certainty to both users and developers, while assisting regulators in fulfilling their duties. A PAS route seems the most likely, but further consideration is needed on the scope of 'taxonomies and performance', 'data governance and liability' and 'commercial governance and liability'. And of course, a big question lurks here, what group is prepared to pay to take independent standards forward? Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for 2017?

cardano, Sponsored , Blockchain Startup to Bring a Casino Platform You Don’t Need to Trust ,"Gambling has been part of human history since the very beginning and its reputation never really has improved over time. The arrival of  Blockchain technology  might truly make a difference. SP8DE, a new Blockchain-based gaming project, aims to bring a platform capable of supplying unbiased public randomness for developing and running casino apps. 

 No more trust issues 

 SP8DE is built on Ouroboros, the POS protocol underlying Cardano Blockchain. The company intends to overcome the obstacles plaguing the gambling industry, even in the decentralized world. 

 First, each block has to be mined which can cause delays in the settlement of values, something no casino can afford if they want to keep their gamblers happy in the highly competitive industry. Blockchain settlement fees can also climb up pretty high scaring away newbie players taking the chance with low amounts. 

 When it comes to big money, you should trust no one and this is exactly the bizarre ethos of SP8DE- don’t trust us, but trust the code as they emphasize through their  white paper . 

 For anyone with a great idea, the company wants to provide a platform where they can develop a compelling gambling application with no house edge, next to nothing for transaction fees, and generating provably fair random numbers. 

 Las Vegas 3.0 

 According to the company’s  white paper , SP8DE’s protocol is transparent, autonomous and easy to understand. Their scripting language is the heart of the platform emphasizing the importance of simplicity and flexibility. All apps the developers will bring to life on SP8DE will be based on smart contracts using SPX, the platform’s native cryptocurrency. Each outcome from each game on the Blockchain will be conditioned upon the realizations of the coin tossing mechanism that fuels the Ouroboros protocol. 

 Thrilling as gambling in itself, SP8DE decided to bring the fun even to its token sale. Everyone who decides to gamble on SP8DE and purchase SPX coins during their Sale stages will be part of their Jackpot game where additional tokens will be distributed randomly among contributors. Just like in a casino, but here everyone wins. Though, those who join the sale earlier and buy more coins will have more chance to take on the house and win a larger share. 

 A fair game for everyone 

 The online gambling industry has really taken off since the dawn of the Internet, the early 1990s. It’s already an industry worth billions of dollars, but it  projected  growth can even reach one tln dollars by 2021. 

 No surprise, the crypto-economy has quickly sucked in the gambling industry, though it still mostly exists as a trendy option rather than the only. Without a doubt, providing anonymity for its users- ‘no need for documentation or even an account’- is one of its most appealing features for gamblers. Transparency is also an important aspect, but what makes the actual difference is it really opened up the door to people to make use of the cryptocurrency loophole in places where  gambling regulations  only apply to fiat money. 

 Casinos might never have a good reputation, they could be in Las Vegas or the digital world, but SP8DE might make the game a bit fairer using the Blockchain technology to its full potential. 

 SP8DE’s ICO has started on Jan. 8 and runs until March 8.

Ethereum  (ETH) dipped below the $500 level for the second time this month after reaching close to $600 on March 24. Bitcoin is below $8,000. 

 Total market capitalization  has dropped to $303 bln at press time, the top-10 digital currencies listed on  Coinmarketcap  are in red. 

 

 While it managed to reach $9,000 on March 24,  Bitcoin  (BTC) has seen a 7.58 percent drop over a 24 hour period, trading at $7,990.84 at press time. BTC lost 22 percent of its value over the last month, according to  Cointelegraph price index . 

 

 Ethereum, which lost 9.04 of its value over 24 hours, has dipped below $500 twice this month. ETH has  lost over 45 percent over the past 30 days, and is currently trading at $480.46.

 EOS , which  previously saw  almost 60 percent growth over a week, has lost 16.56 percent in the past 24 hours. At press time EOS is trading at $5.52. 

 After a week of growth, crypto markets are seeing a significant downturn that  started yesterday . Last week, the US  Internal Revenue Service  (IRS)  warned  crypto investors to report their cryptocurrency earnings on their income tax returns, stating that virtual currency is considered property and is thus subject to federal taxes.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-market-in-the-red-bitcoin-falls-below-8000-ethereum-dips-below-500,cointelegraph,2018-03-26,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Bitcoin’s Price Jumps $1,000 In 30 Minutes Of Market Growth Across The Board ","The crypto markets experienced an explosion of growth today, April 12, with  Bitcoin  (BTC) jumping more than $1,000 to break $8,000 over just a 30 minute period, and the rest of the market solidly in the green. 

 

 While no specific events have been confirmed as the reason for the sharp price jumps across the board, Twitter users have speculated that the recent news that Bitcoin has been  declared compliant with Shariah law  – according to a report  published online today, April 12  – may have contributed to the spike:

 Ethereum  (ETH) also experienced a notable price spike, jumping to around $465 by press time – after a month of hovering around the $400 mark – and is up by more than 12 percent over a 24 hour period. 

 

 Total market cap also hit above $300 bln for the first time this month, dropping slightly down again to  $297 bln  by press time. 

 

 Of the top ten coins listed on  CoinMarketCap ,  EOS  is  still up the most , more than 30 percent over a 24 hour period, and trading at around $8.90 by press time. EOS’s price spike could be attributed to  EOSIS’s April 9 pre-release  of the Dawn 3.0  Blockchain  platform. 

 Some of the other top ten  altcoins  have seen high percent growth as well, with 9 of the 10 (including BTC) showing more than 10 percent growth over a 24 hour period.  Cardano  is up around 22 percent over a 24 hour period, trading for around $0.18;  IOTA  is up 14 percent, trading for around $1.18; and  NEO  is up almost 13 percent, trading for around $60.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoins-price-jumps-1000-in-30-minutes-of-market-growth-across-the-board,cointelegraph,2018-04-12,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Crypto Markets See Slight Slump, While Crypto Investors Maintain High Predictions ","Bitcoin’s  (BTC) price has gone back under $8,000, and  Ethereum’s  (ETH) briefly under $500, as the crypto markets experience a slight slump today, April 16. 

 

 BTC’s price last week had  jumped $1,000  in 30 minutes, maintaining a  relatively steady upward trend  across the board in the aftermath of the jump. 

 BTC is currently trading for around $7,944, down around 5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time. 

 

 ETH is also down around 5 percent over a 24 hour period to press time, now trading above $500 again at around $503. 

 

 Of the top ten coins listed on  CoinMarketCap , only altcoin  Cardano  (ADA) is in the green, up almost 8 percent over a 24 hour period and trading at around $0.23 by press time. Cardano’s upward swing could be attributed to news that crypto platform Huboi, ranked the number two exchange for 24 hour volume on  CoinMarketCap , will  add Cardano  to its listings today. 

 Cointelegraph contributor Joseph Young tweeted today that he is more “comfortable” with a market where every altcoin doesn’t necessarily follow Bitcoin: 

 
 I'm more comfortable with the cryptocurrency market now, as cryptocurrencies have started to demonstrate independent movements. 
 
Bitcoin did not make major movements today, but Cardao rose by 11% and ICON went up 8%. I like that cryptos are not just following the trend of BTC.

 Total market cap remains above $300 bln, which it broke on April 12, currently at around  $319 bln  by press time. 

 

 This week has seen some bold predictions by actors in the crypto space, as investment tycoon  Tim Draper   predicted  that he saw BTC hitting $250,000 by 2022 - a claim  held up  by CNBC Fast Money’s Brian Kelly - and bullish  Wall Street  predictor  Tom Lee   repeated  his stance that BTC will reach $25,000 in 2018.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-see-slight-slump-while-crypto-investors-maintain-high-predictions,cointelegraph,2018-04-16,00:00:00,en

Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. 
 The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. 
 Cardano is the  seventh  largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization. It has made a stellar comeback in the past few days on the back of its listing on the Huobi exchange and  introduction  of additional trading pairs on Binance exchange.

 Traders also seem to be bullish on the  fundamental  front as many believe that it can become a major competitor to  Ethereum . 
 So, what does the future look like? 
 Weekly chart 
 
 The  ADA/BTC  pair has a short but volatile history. From the lows of 0.00000254 on November 02 of last year, it skyrocketed to an intraday high of 0.00009180 on January 04 of this year. That’s a staggering return of 3514 percent within a span of about two months. 
 Thereafter, from there, it entered into a downtrend, which saw it plunge 81 percent from the highs to 0.00001673 on March 18. 
 What can the investors expect from here on? 
 For the past five weeks, the digital currency is in a pullback, which has reached close to 23.6 percent retracement of the fall from 0.00009180 to 0.00001673. 
 After such a sharp decline, a ‘V’ shaped recovery is unlikely because traders who had purchased at higher levels and were watching their portfolio sink to a huge loss would bail out once their buy levels are reached. 
 Similarly, short-term traders, who have purchased near the lows will also book profits on rallies. 
 The important levels to watch out on the upside are 38.2 percent Fibonacci retracement level of 0.00004541 and the 50 percent retracement levels of 0.00005427. 
 The start of a new uptrend can be confirmed only after the next decline towards the recent lows. A range bound action for a few weeks is also possible, which will be a positive sign. Longer the time spent in forming a base, larger will be the ensuing rally. 
 Let’s see how to use the levels above for trading.   
 Daily chart 
 
 The daily chart shows how the current pullback has stalled right at the 23.6 percent retracement levels. For the past seven days, Cardano has been consolidating near the overhead resistance without giving up much ground. This is a positive sign. We also like the bullish crossover of the moving averages. 
 We should see another attempt by the bulls to break out of the overhead resistance within the next few days. If they succeed, a rally to 0.00004541 will be on the cards. 
 If the break out fails, then most of the traders who have purchased at lower levels will book out of their positions resulting in a dip. 
 The 20-day EMA will be the first support. If this breaks, a decline to the 50-day SMA is also possible. 
 So, how should one trade it? 
 How to trade the ADA/BTC pair now? 
 Long-term traders should accumulate positions on dips towards the 50-day SMA and keep a stop loss at 0.00001600. If prices sustain below the March 18 lows of 0.00001673, the targets on the downside are 0.00000965 and 0.00000560. The target of this trade is 0.000054 and higher. 
 Short-term traders, who have purchased at lower levels can hold their positions with a stop loss at 0.00003 levels. 
 Fresh positions by short-term traders should be only considered on a breakout and close (UTC) above 0.000035 levels with a close stop loss. Their first target is 0.000045.

 The “trillion” value has also been bandied around before, as Dan Morehead, CEO of $1 billion crypto hedge fund Pantera Capital  said in April  that a $40 trillion crypto market is possible, in part due to Wall Street’s increasing interest in clearing crypto trades.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-co-founder-wall-street-will-bring-tens-of-trillions-of-dollars-to-crypto,cointelegraph,2018-06-23,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple Suffer From Hangover, Cardano Recovers Faster","Last week of June started with a recovery after another sharp fall of the market during the previous days and Tuesday continues this tendency. Although the buyers are still very careful (not without reason) the sellers seem to be extremely exhausted as we see that each new downward movement is shorter and less dramatic than a previous one. Another sign that the bears may soon run out of luck is that Bitcoin’s breakdown through the psychologically important $6,000 mark didn’t cause further panic sales as it could be expected. A cherry on the pie is issuing of 250 mln fresh USDT tokens by Tether which previously acted as a catalyst for market growth. Despite all the positive symptoms the reversal is yet to be confirmed. Total market capitalization reached $238 bln in the course of the weekend which is the year’s minimum. It’s a high time for the bulls to reveal themselves and save investors’ holdings before the community start losing faith in crypto. Notwithstanding the sellers may still sing their swan’s song, the catharsis in near. And we know a good recipe for making crypto prices great again. Check it in our review! During past 24 hours, Bitcoin price hardly changed with one percent gain, the father of crypto is trading at $6,200. This, however, is perfectly normal after sharp rebound from $5,800. Nothing happens quickly on the market nowadays, bulls and bears are week and gathering forces before a further move. BTCUSD The important things to note on the four-hour chart is the following: first of all, BTC is still in descending channel, the last attempt of the bulls to break through it resulted in $800 decline on the weekend. Secondly, each new fall/rebound cycle was weaker than the previous one. Thirdly, we see a so-called J-turn from $5,800 which is frequently a sign of a trend reversal if supported by trading volumes. Summarizing the aforesaid we presume that the bears still have chances to drag the price even lower, to support zone at $5,400-$5,600, however the end of the downtrend is near. The nearest bulls’ targets coincide with important resistance zones at $6,350, $6,620 and $7,000. The last target rests on the long-term ascending trend and 0.618 value of the relevant Fibonacci extension therefore only its overcoming will confirm the change in market’s current logic. Despite positive outlook on the chart, Ethereum was closely following the whole market’s and in particular Bitcoin’s moves. Top 10 coins don’t show any independence so it’s hard to predict further destination looking at altcoins’ charts although bulls and bears targets can be predicted with high degree of accuracy. ETHUSD The global bull wedge is almost completed and considering some margin of safety it will be extremely difficult for the bears to destroy the pattern. If activated (which implies breaking through $500), we may see a rally towards $580 (0.382 Fibonacci retracement level) and then 630 (coinciding with 0.5 retracement of the same grid). The prospective target of $680-700 is visible, but its achievement in mid-term may be difficult. We would also like to draw reader’s attention at curve mirror level which goes through our targets confirming them. As for a decline scenario, we may see a double bottom at $420 and a very strong support in the range of $360-$400. With careful stop-losses, Ethereum may be considered for growing long positions already now. At first sight Ripple’s chart looks very similar to Ethereum’s one although there are a very important differences which completely change the picture. We see the same bull’s wedge but with no support below the minimum of $0.44 that was reached on the weekend. This simply means that in case of bears’ victory in the fight for Bitcoin the prices may go to very dangerous levels unseen since 2017. XRPUSD The other difference from Ethereum chart is low trading volumes that reflect the lack of investors’ interest in the altcoin. The big whale’s splash can of course assist Ripple to reach the set of targets defined by technical analysis which are $0.55 and $0.68–$0.75 respectively, but at the moment we don’t see crazy profits from Ripple trading on the horizon. In case of further decline, a skillful trader may try his luck catching Ripple at $0.44 with obligatory stop loss somewhere nearby but we would better seek more safe investment ideas. And again we see a familiar Ethereum and Ripple look-a-like chart. Cardano recovered approximately three percent in the past 24 hours doing even better than Bitcoin, but we can’t definitely say that worst is over. What we can say for sure– that Cardano is cheap enough to engage for decent profits in mid- and long-term. ADAUSD During the latest decline altcoin’s bottom was established at $0.12 and in principle nothing prevents bears to test this achievement once again. We, however, expect an increase in buyers’ activity in the region of $0.10 – $0,125 where a limit buy order can be placed. The good sing is that the price is pinned to the upper boundary of the wedge, however as it can be notice on the chart, one false breakthrough has already taken place. In case of general positive mood on the market we expect bulls race to $0.173 and then probably to $0.2 to the intersection of the mirror and resistance levels. Fibonacci grid is of more relevance in ADA/USD pair but may also provide some hints in case of active growth.    ",https://u.today/bitcoin-ethereum-ripple-suffer-from-hangover-cardano-recovers-faster,utoday,2018-06-26,08:34:00,en

 Consolidation of yesterday’s significant market growth is likely still buoyed by yesterday’s bullish  news  that the $6.3 trillion asset management heavyweight BlackRock –– the world’s largest provider of exchange traded-funds ( ETF ) –– is beginning to assess potential involvement in Bitcoin. 

 CNBC trading advisor Ran Neu-Ner has today  drawn attention  to the  news  that the world-renowned Chartered Financial Analyst ( CFA ) examination is adding  cryptocurrency  and  blockchain  topics to its curriculum, a move that is poised to bring widespread knowledge of crypto to the financial mainstream. 

 Neu-Ner’s excitement comes following his  remark  yesterday that BlackRock’s potential entry into crypto would make 2017’s  bull run  come to “look like a warm-up” -- echoing the widespread  narrative  that major institutional interest is set to  skyrocket  crypto valuations. 

 Positive news has continued to flood in today, with  Japanese  internet giant SBI Holdings formally  launching  the public version of its crypto exchange VCTRADE today, a triumph in the context of  increasingly stringent   regulatory demands  for tightened security among the country’s operators. 

 Major  U.S.  crypto exchange and wallet service provider  Coinbase  has meanwhile just received the  all-clear  from the country’s regulators to list specific digital assets that are considered to be securities — representing significant progress in its bid to operate as an  officially regulated  crypto broker dealer. 

 Also today, a new project for a U.S. dollar-pegged  stablecoin  that runs on the  Stellar   blockchain  network  received  backing from tech giant  IBM , which has reportedly already begun testing the asset. 

 Aviation giant Boeing has for its part  announced  that it will be partnering with an artificial intelligence ( AI ) firm to develop pilotless vehicles and other products using  blockchain .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-above-7-000-as-positive-momentum-continues-following-yesterday-s-market-upswing,cointelegraph,2018-07-17,00:00:00,en

 While the market is seeing a more mixed picture today, Bitcoin’s recent divergence from other crypto assets has prompted CNBC trading advisor Ran NeuNer to  venture  that we may be on the cusp of a bull market. The analyst attributes the top coin’s strong performance to  news  earlier this month that the $6.3 trillion asset manager and  ETF -giant BlackRock is beginning to assess potential involvement in Bitcoin. As per NeuNer’s scenario: 

 
 “-BTC goes up in anticipation of ETF at the expense of Alts. 
- Investors start to pay more attention to BTC as it is getting returns. 
- New money flows in again including institutional funds. 
- BTC runs , investors exit and invest in Alts. 
- Bull market again…” 
 

 While many hold the view that crypto-based ETFs would be a “ holy grail ” for the crypto industry, news that BlackRock may also be eyeing an entry into  Bitcoin futures  trading could prove more divisive, given  suggestions  from figures including Fundstrat’s  Tom Lee  that  Bitcoin’s “gut wrenching” price weakness this spring was tied to futures contract expirations. 

 In May, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco had similarly  alleged  that Bitcoin’s price decline was the result of the  introduction  of futures trading on  CBOE , and  then   CME , in Dec. 2017. 

 This week, CME  revealed  that the average daily volume of Bitcoin futures on its platform increased by 93 percent in Q2 over Q1 in 2018, also indicating that the number of open contracts had exceeded 2,400 — a 58 percent increase over Q1.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-breaks-8-000-as-selected-alts-see-slight-recovery,cointelegraph,2018-07-24,00:00:00,en

 BTC dominance by market capitalization continues to inch upwards, now at  47.2 percent  according to CoinMarketCap, after  posting  its 2018 record-high earlier this week. 

 Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian — whose VC firm Initialized Capital was one of U.S. crypto  exchange   Coinbase ’s first investors —   said  in a fresh interview that the “battle-tested” coin is “certainly the most robust” noting that “as volatile as it’s been...[Bitcoin] continu[es] to go up over the long term.” 

 Ethereum  (ETH) is trading around $471 at press time, seeing around a 1 percent loss on the day. The top altcoin has seen considerable price movement between its morning peak at $484 and subsequent dip to as low as $464.

 Tezos  (XTZ) has been hit with steep losses of almost 5 percent, trading at around $2.13 to press time, following news that “Big Four” auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers ( PwC ) will conduct an external audit of its finances and operations. 

 While the Foundation has heralded the news as a watershed moment — it is “the first” large-scale blockchain organization to be monitored by PwC — the news has perhaps nonetheless drawn fresh attention to  controversies  that have  beset  the project since last year. 

 Total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies is around $297 billion at press time, after surging to around $304 billion during early trading hours.

 The grim market picture is likely due to yesterday’s  breaking news  that the Winklevoss Twins’ application for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund ( ETF ) has now been rejected for a second time by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ).

 Of the top 100 cryptocurrencies by market cap, just seven coins are in the green on the day to press time, according to CoinMarketCap. 

 Crypto entrepreneur  Charlie Shrem  has  argued  on Twitter yesterday that the SEC’s  second  rejection of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF it is in some sense “old news.” He stated that a pending decision over the Bitcoin ETF that has recently been  filed  by VanEck & SolidX for trading on the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) will be more pivotal for the industry — and would likely generate more price-impactful “ETF excitement.” 

 Shrem moreover argued that regulators will be more likely to grant a stalwart mainstream institution such as CBOE the right to trade an ETF, and that this was a more decisive factor in the Winklevoss rejection than the SEC’s alleged qualms over inadequate “resistance to price manipulation” yesterday. In response to Shrem’s argument, other commentators have  nuanced  his perspective, saying that: 

 
 “The VanEck SolidX Bitcoin Trust ($XBTC) will trade on the CBOE. Its pricing relies on the MVIS Bitcoin OTC Index, not a [single crypto] exchange like Gemini. It seems like the SEC would have to deem OTC markets as having better investor protections and liquidity. More investigation is required.” 
 

 Other simply  consider  that the SEC’s broadcasting of its concerns over vulnerabilities to market manipulation in an  insufficiently sized  regulated derivatives (futures) market will be “hard to overcome” — it appears that these fears have been borne out by markets, at least in the immediate-short term. 

 Meanwhile, on July 24 the SEC  delayed its decision  on a Bitcoin ETF application from investment firm Direxion, the same day as digital asset manager Bitwise filed its own application with the regulator for an ETF that would track an index of ten cryptocurrencies. 

 Yesterday, the CEO of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME )  said  the institution would not be introducing  futures  on cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin anytime soon, reiterating his  earlier comments  that it would be “a little irresponsible” to launch  altcoin  futures contracts given that they are still “highly volatile and new.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-markets-tumble-as-sec-rejects-winklevoss-twins-second-bitcoin-etf-application,cointelegraph,2018-07-27,00:00:00,en

 While the markets remain shaky in the short term, two new financial reports have indicated that major players in both the emerging crypto industry and the traditional financial sector have been reaping handsome profits from their crypto-related ventures. 

 Yesterday, figures cited by Fortune for crypto  mining  hardware giant  Bitmain  suggested the firm  earned  around $1 billion in net profit in the first quarter of 2018, with an estimated $2 to $3 billion in future profit for the entire year. 

 Today, online banking service provider Swissquote  reported  a 44 percent surge in profits in the first half of 2018, an uplift attributed to the “crypto boom” earlier this year. In July 2017, the  Swiss -based online bank was credited by many with becoming “the first” European online bank to  launch  Bitcoin trading accounts for its clients.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-dips-below-8-000-amid-market-wide-losses,cointelegraph,2018-07-31,00:00:00,en

 Ripple  (XRP) is the only outlier, up 1.6 percent and seeing a spike in price earlier today, despite trading downwards most of the week. The coin is currently trading at $0.44 to press time.

 While the markets have seen their second, faltering day of continued losses, recent news indicates that the distance between the crypto industry and major institutional players continues to narrow. 

 Yesterday, Northern Trust Corp., a global asset management firm with $954 billion in total assets under management,  revealed  its plans to start a custody service for digital assets. 

 Meanwhile, news of  Morgan Stanley ’s  recruitment  of a self-described crypto trading expert and 12-year veteran of  Credit Suisse  as its new head of digital asset markets suggests that the trend of figures leaving the traditional financial sector for crypto continues.

 ICE moreover plans to launch physically-delivered BTC futures contracts this November, distinct from those currently offered on  CME  and  CBOE  that are ultimately settled in fiat. 

 The likes of Starbucks and  Microsoft  are on board for the new venture, dubbed “Bakkt,” which will begin by offering Bitcoin-fiat conversion for consumers to purchase everyday goods with crypto.

 As markets continue to hover without conviction, prominent crypto onlookers are taking stock of the week’s news for the crypto space.

 ICE has unveiled plans to create a  Microsoft  cloud-powered ecosystem for digital assets that will encompass federally regulated markets and warehousing and instant fiat-crypto conversion for merchants and consumer needs.

 Fundstrat’s head of research and well-known Bitcoin bull Tom Lee today used his firm’s recently  launched  Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) to  evaluate  the coin’s current market momentum. The index determines that any value below 27 signals promising future returns, while 68 is set as a “time to sell” misery threshold. With the index presently at 39, Lee said: 

 ""Bitcoin isn't broken if it's holding at these levels. I think people are afraid it is going to go back down to $6,000 and never come back from those bear markets.” 

 The analyst also noted the recent uptrend in Bitcoin dominance by market capitalization, which as of press time is pushing  48 percent . In late July, BTC dominance had surged to 2018  record-highs , hitting levels not seen since last December, at a time when the coin was trading just below its  $20,000  industry peak.

 While today’s sprightly uptick may assuage some edgy crypto nerves,  Dogecoin  creator  Jackson Palmer  has been eyeing the recent plummeting markets, which many attributed to U.S. regulators’ announcement August 7 that they would be  delaying  their decision over whether or not to approve a high-profile BTC exchange-traded-fund ( ETF ). 

 In a  thread  of tweets this morning, Palmer pointed to data showing declining daily transaction rates for  Bitcoin ,  Ethereum  (ETH) and  Ripple  (XRP), as well as a  downtrend  in decentralized application (dApp) usage, as more noteworthy indicators of the “fragility” of the space. 

 More optimistically, Litecoin (LTC) creator Charlie Lee said in a  tweet  today that he considers the bear market to be “the best time for people to work on adoption.”

 As the dizzying vagaries of the crypto markets leave some reeling, a team of financial experts from Yale University have this week  suggested  a system of factors to predict price trends in major cryptocurrencies. 

 They found that cryptocurrencies “have no exposure” to most common stock markets, nor to returns of currencies and commodities and macroeconomic factors. Instead, they identified crypto-specific patterns, including a “strong time-series momentum effect” among major assets such as Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple, as well as a correlation between price and investor attention, which they deduced via social media and search engine trend analyses. 

 Commenting on this “investor attention,” Pantera Capital CEO Dan Morehead today  said  that crypto markets have recently witnessed something of an overreaction from investors in response to short-term news, such as the SEC’s Bitcoin ETF delay.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/after-a-catastrophic-week-crypto-markets-rally-forth-into-the-green,cointelegraph,2018-08-09,00:00:00,en

cardano, Sponsored , Universal Wallet Becomes the ‘First’ to Support Cardano’s ADA on Mobile ,"The company behind a multi-asset, universal wallet that can store major crypto and smart contract tokens in one place says it has become the first mobile wallet to support the ADA cryptocurrency. Infinito Wallet  says the milestone coincides with an update to version 1.15.0 of its platform – enabling users to “securely send, receive and check transaction history of ADA.” According to the company, this development is significant because very few wallets on the market support ADA, and there is no such app for mobile devices. Infinito developers have worked with the development team behind Cardano and  IOHK , and they utilized their official  Cardano Rust project  to seamlessly integrate ADA-support into the Infinito Wallet. With IOHK’s permission and support, Infinito has contributed code to the open-source Cardano Rust project for ADA mobile wallet integration and will continue such support for the Cardano open-source community. Although there is a desktop wallet exclusive to ADA called Daedalus, Infinito Wallet says people who hold this cryptocurrency deserve a mobile-driven, “ultra-lightweight and portable” alternative, which would maintain the utmost stability and security. Furthermore, on its roadmap, the Universal Wallet plans to support unique features of the Cardano blockchain, including staking Ouroboros. ADA  now joins thousands of other tokens on the biggest smart contract platforms — such as ETH, EOS, NEO — together with leading coins, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, ETC and Dogecoin, supported by Infinito Wallet. Understanding ADA Infinito Wallet describes the ADA cryptocurrency, which is based on the third-generation Cardano blockchain, as “digital cash that represents the future of money.” It is hoped the technology will pave the way for fast, direct and secure transfers — and in time,  Cardano  plans to “tackle numerous problems facing the crypto industry” through a smart contract platform for the financial applications that consumers, businesses and governments can rely on. The company says it has gone through a third-party  security audit , and now users have  full access to their private keys . Through the  Infinito Wallet  app, which is available on  Apple’s App Store  for iOS devices and  Google Play  for Android smartphones and tablets, users can check their ADA balance through the dashboard, send the cryptocurrency to any address and review their transaction history. It is also possible to receive ADA by sharing a public address or through a unique QR code that has been integrated into the app. More upgrades planned The company says it plans to launch version 2.0 of its universal wallet in the fourth quarter of this year, and this will be equipped with a new design that offers a higher degree of customization and an enhanced experience for Infinito Wallet’s user base. Other features are going to include “full support” for blockchain mainnets, including Ontology and more. Infinito Wallet will also be launching various reward campaigns, including free token Airdrops and Referral programs in Q4, to offer more incentives to users. The universal wallet is available in a plethora of languages — including  English ,  Chinese ,  Japanese ,  Vietnamese , Korean and Russian — and announcements through its official  Telegram  groups are also available in four languages. In a nod to its mobile-driven approach, Infinito Wallet supports Touch ID to provide “easy and fast app access without sacrificing security.” Additionally, its apps allow users to store a list of the addresses that they send and receive money from the most, with a view to pave the way for “hassle-free transactions.” Unlike other wallets, the company says it allows users to include messages with their transactions — making it easier to maintain their records. This is coupled with an ability to export an account’s entire transaction history via .csv files and emails. In the future, users will be able to see the fiat value of their portfolio and how it has changed over the past 24 hours, in real time. Infinito Wallet launched toward the end of 2017  — it has been downloaded by more than 250,000 users and has received positive reviews by the community. The brand is the brainchild of Infinity Blockchain Labs Europe, which hopes that its universal wallet will “serve as a gateway for users to maximize usage and potential of their cryptocurrencies.”   Disclaimer.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: TRON, Bitcoin, Litecoin, EOS, Cardano ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the   HitBTC   exchange. On October 11, the total market capitalization of the cryptocurrencies  plunged  below $200 billion for the first time since  September 20 , as a global risk-off trade led investors to dump their holdings. However, the encouraging sign is that the sell-off was short-lived and most currencies are trying to claw back. The next week is critical because it will provide insight on whether the currencies will break down of their key supports or rise above their overhead resistances. A breakdown to new lows will be negative and might signal the extension of the ongoing bear market. On the other hand, if the bulls succeed in scaling the key levels, it will signal a likely bottom and might attract buying. Let’s take a look at the top 5 performers of the week and their medium-term outlook. TRX/USD Among the digital currencies that have a market capitalization of more than $1 billion,  TRON  is the only one that has managed to stay in the green in the past seven days.  Two  news stories attracted buyers in a range bound/falling market. The first news that pushed prices higher was the  tweet  from Justin Sun, CEO of TRON on October 08. He said that the latest upgrade would make the digital currency “200x faster than Ethereum and cost 100x cheaper than EOS.” The second news that led to higher prices was the  tweet  on October 12 that hinted at a partnership with an industry giant. So, can this fundamental news propel prices higher and should the investors buy now? Let’s study the charts and find out. The  TRX/USD  pair topped out at $0.35013935 on January 05. At the current levels, the price is down about 93 percent from the highs. Since August 14, it has stopped falling and is trying to form a range. Such a consolidation shows that the owners of the digital currency are in no hurry to sell their holdings. Additionally, the investors are buying on dips, close to $0.0183. The range has seen two touches at the top and two at the bottom. If the bulls break out and sustain above the range, it will indicate the probable start of a new uptrend. The first pattern target is $0.03801042. However, when the breakout happens after a large consolidation, it easily overshoots the minimum pattern target. Therefore, in the medium-term, investors can expect a move to $0.0415 followed by a rally to $0.052. If the bears sink prices below $0.01587681, the downtrend will resume. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for a confirmed breakout and only then initiate a long position. BTC/USD The sell-off in the global stock markets caught up with  Bitcoin . The  warning  by International Monetary Fund (IMF) that the “rapid growth” of the new asset class could create “new vulnerabilities in the international financial system,"" did not help matters either. Global economist Nouriel Roubini continued his  anti-crypto  rhetoric. He called cryptocurrencies “the mother or father of all scams and bubbles,” and the blockchain technology as “nothing better than a glorified spreadsheet or database.” Another  study  from Juniper Research warned of an implosion in the crypto markets. Still, the  BTC/USD  pair ended as the second-best performer among the mega cap digital currencies. So, does this signal buying at the lows? On a medium-term timeframe, Bitcoin has formed a large descending triangle pattern. It has formed successive lower highs but has largely held the $6,000 levels in 2018. Each lower high shows that the sellers are in a hurry to short or liquidate their positions and are not waiting for higher levels. The bulls have been buying only on dips close to $6,000, which has resulted in the support being held. If the bears break the $5,900 levels, it is likely to attract further short selling and long liquidation, pushing prices to $5,450 and $5,000 levels. The first sign of a change in trend will be a close above the downtrend line of the triangle. Investors should wait for a breakout above the most recent low of $6,831.99 to sustain for about three days before turning bullish. LTC/USD Winklevoss  twins led cryptocurrency exchange  Gemini , has  received  the required regulatory approval to add  Litecoin  trading and custody since October 12. The  LTC/USD  pair has been in a steady downtrend. Previous attempts to stabilize and start a new uptrend have failed at higher levels. For the past two months, the digital currency has been consolidating in a tight range near the lows. A breakdown of the range will resume the downtrend. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of the range, a rally to $94 levels is possible. A new uptrend will be confirmed only after the virtual currency successfully defends the breakout of the range and makes a series of higher highs and higher lows. Until then, it is best to remain on the sidelines. EOS/USD The  EOS  community is trying to bridge the gap between the West and the East. Language barriers, cultural differences and use of different platforms for conversing with each other were causing issues to the Chinese users. The  EOS Mandarin Arbitration Community (EMAC) , created to help the Mandarin-speaking users, is believed to be able to bring the two continents together. In the medium-term time frame, the  EOS/USD  pair has largely been range bound between $18.67-$3.8723. Both the top and the bottom of the range have been tested twice. Though the bulls broke out of the range in end-April, they could not sustain the highs and prices crashed back into the range. On the downside, the bulls have been defending the bottom of the range but have failed to rally higher. The digital currency has been trading close to the bottom of the range for the past two months. A breakdown can start a new downtrend that can result in a sharp fall. On the upside, a breakout of $6.8299 will signal the start of a new upswing. The first target is $9.1668. If the bulls scale $10 levels, a rally to $15 is possible. ADA/USD Charles Hoskinson, founder of Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), and Ken Kodama, CEO of Emurgo  have demanded  the resignation of Michael Parsons, chairman of the Cardano Foundation. They have cited lack of performance and the non-responsive attitude of the council and the chairman as a “great frustration.” The Foundation is yet to respond. The  possibility of Coinbase listing  the coin is doing the rounds. If successful, it might give a boost to  Cardano ’s price. So, is it worth buying? Let’s find out. The  ADA/USD  pair has been in a long-term downtrend. It has fallen about 94 percent from the highs of $1.396281, reached on January 05. Various attempts to start a new uptrend have failed as higher levels attract selling. For the past one month, the digital currency is trying to form a range close to the bottom. If the bears break down of $0.060105, it will resume its downtrend. On the upside, the bulls will have to scale $0.094256 and $0.111843 to signal strength. A sequence of higher highs and higher lows will herald the start of a new uptrend. If the bulls breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $0.111843 for three days in a row, a move to $0.2-$0.23 is probable. Medium-term traders should wait for a new uptrend to start before initiating any long positions. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC   exchange.

cardano, News ," U.K. MP to Advise Crypto Exchange on Gov't Relations, Says 'Steep Learning Curve' Ahead ","U.K.  Member of Parliament (MP) Stephen Hammond has joined the advisory board of a new retail investor-focused crypto exchange to provide guidance on government relations. The news was shared in a press release with Cointelegraph today, Oct. 22. Hammond is also notably a member of the Treasury Select Committee, where he is responsible for government financial oversight and regulation. The exchange, dubbed IronX, is a regulated platform that has been jointly established by digital trading firm IronFX and EmurgoHK, developers of the ninth-largest crypto by market cap, Cardano ( ADA ). The platform says it “aims to “bring crypto trading to the mass retail trading market.” Hammond has served as MP for the constituency of Wimbledon in London since 2005, and reportedly worked in the financial markets for twenty years prior to starting his political career. He is quoted today as saying that, “we are all on a steep learning curve to understand this new asset class,” adding: “The only way cryptocurrencies will be trusted and become accepted in the traditional business environment is through regulation [...] This includes governments, policymakers, regulators and the financial services industry. Governments cannot afford to be ambiguous in their stance and need to engage with the industry.” The MP continued to give a positive endorsement of the emerging sector, stating his belief that “a great opportunity exists to improve the current status quo of the financial system.” IronX CEO Markos A. Kashiouris has stated that regulatory approval was a “key milestone” for the exchange ahead of its public launch, which is  reportedly  slated for this December. Last month, Ironx was granted a licence by the Estonian Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU), enabling it to offered crypto-fiat exchange and crypto wallet services. As previously reported, Hammond’s fellow U.K. Tory MP and  blockchain  advocate Matt Hancock  delivered  a speech this spring in which he spoke of the “monumental impact” that blockchain technology could have on the financial sector, government services, and laws and regulation. In late August, Cointelegraph also  reported  that U.K. financial watchdog The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) granted its third e-money license to date to a crypto-related company, prepaid crypto-fiat debit card Wirex, having previously  granted  a similar license to exchange and wallet service  Coinbase  in March.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/uk-mp-to-advise-crypto-exchange-on-govt-relations-says-steep-learning-curve-ahead,cointelegraph,2018-10-22,00:00:00,en
cardano, Analysis , The Mysterious East: Decrypting Japanese Crypto Traders ,"Japan  is one of the key countries in the crypto financial world, where the headquarter of Bitcoin.com is situated, the crypto exchange  Mt. Gox  was established, the Bitcoin’s creator  Satoshi Nakamoto  name comes from, and cryptocurrencies in general are  legalized . But, what do we really know about the growing industry of cryptocurrencies in the Land of the Rising Sun? What and where can be bought in Japan with crypto? What is the attitude of the authorities towards digital assets after adoption of the regulatory legislation? Recent changes in the structure of Japanese state apparatus, as an  appointment  of a prominent pro-blockchain politician Takuya Hirai as Minister of Science, Technology, and IT, could benefit the further development of the blockchain technology in the country. Housewives behind Bitcoin surge Before the advent of the Japanese currency, Japanese traders were  considered  extremely cautious and conservative. They rather  preferred  to invest in low-yield risk-free assets, such as national bonds. However,  a recent study  by  Deutsche Bank  showed that a large number of Japanese crypto traders, despite all of the previous history, cease to be cautious, choosing risky, but highly profitable investments. According to Deutsche bank AG analysts, “retail investors are shifting from leveraged foreign-exchange trading to leveraged cryptocurrency trading.” They also developed a profile of an investor who stands behind the surge in Bitcoin – so-called Mrs. Watanabe, a common term used to describe a housewife who runs her family’s finances.  Japan is unique in terms of women’s power called “okozukai” in finance system. And crypto industry is not an exception. On April 10, 2018, the Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA)  published  the first in the world statistical report on domestic cryptocurrency trading over the past financial year. According to the data collected from seventeen  crypto exchanges , the country has about 3.5 million individuals who conduct annual transactions in the amount of more than $97 billion. The bulk of these traders are Japanese businessmen around the age of 30. 143,000 of them prefer margin trading and cryptocurrency futures. Market review In mid-2018 Japan had a dominant share in the world trade volume of BTC. In July the pair BTC/JPY according to the  CryptoCompare  website accounted for almost 60% of all operations with Bitcoin, which indicated the unprecedented popularity of this currency in the country. Even as the  stablecoin  trend, which  appeared  on the market in the second half of summer, took  USDT  into the lead, the Japanese yen still remains in the top four currencies with the highest trading volume against Bitcoin. Although this figure has dropped to seven percent, which is eight times lower than the summer value. Since 2014, the annual trading volume in pairs with Bitcoin has grown from $22 million to $97 billion in the country. At the same time, Bitcoin trading as the main asset, such as futures, has increased even more: from $2 million to $543 billion for the same period of time. It seems that Bitcoin hasn’t lost its popularity even in view of recent events — the Japanese continue to believe in Satoshi Nakamoto’s brainchild. But diversification is also practiced — the  portfolio  of the average Japanese trader includes such altcoins as ETH, XRP, BCH and EOS. Moreover, the ""Trade to Mine"" technology, recently  announced  by several cryptocurrency exchanges, is gaining popularity in Japan — local tokens are credited for trading on these exchanges. The company CoinJinja even  introduced  into its analytical application CoinView, a special trading bot, which can ""mine"" such coins. The function is called “Hummingbird” and at the moment is actively promoted both in Japan and abroad. Besides, in Japan there is almost no peer-to-peer trading between individuals, and  99.9 percent of all transactions  are carried out through exchanges. Mt. Gox and Coincheck The history of digital currencies in Japan is inseparably linked with the two largest cryptocurrency hacks. The first was the  hacking  of the  Mt. Gox  exchange in 2014, where attackers managed to steal 850,000 BTC for a total of $473 million. When news of this broke, Bitcoin's price fell by  20 percent  and only stopped around $483. It took the market a whole year to restore its previously held values. This incident also had a ""conditionally positive"" effect. After the Mt. Gox collapse, regulators seriously  took up  the issue of regulating cryptocurrency transactions in the country, which led to the emergence of a number of bills. Much later, in early 2018, the market  experienced  a second major shock — a hacker attack was directed toward the  NEM  hot wallet, in one of the largest crypto exchanges in Japan,  Coincheck . On Jan. 28, criminals managed to withdraw the most significant amount in the history of crypto crimes — more than $500 million. This hack sent a devastating blow to the entire Japanese crypto infrastructure, since the entire POS application of ""Mobile Payment for Air Regi"" belonging to the big Japanese company Recruit Lifestyle was  connected  to this exchange. On its own, the application was used by more than 260,000 Japanese shops for executing transactions. The total damage caused to the global crypto economy amounted to more than $1 billion and significantly affected the dynamics of all cryptocurrencies. From that moment the state began to get involved and the direct regulation of cryptocurrency began to take more prominence. State regulation February 2014  — CEO of Mt. Gox  Mark Karpeles   held  a press conference where he reported a theft of  850,000 BTC . Concerned, the Japanese government  decided  to look into the issue in detail. March 7, 2014  —  the National Senate  moved forward  to legalize  Bitcoin . The resolution didn’t consider Bitcoin as a currency or a security in accordance with the  current banking law  and recognized the absence of laws that would unconditionally prohibit individuals or legal entities from obtaining Bitcoin in exchange for goods or services. At the same time, authorities started discussing the possibility of applying  taxation  to Bitcoin. May 4, 2016  — after lengthy disputes and discussions, Japan officially  recognized  Bitcoin and digital currency as ""a means of payment that is not a legal currency""  (Japan's Payment Services Act (PSA), art. 2-5) . Also, amendments were made to the Law on the Establishment of Foundations. According to the new legislation, all Japanese cryptocurrency exchanges must be officially registered and listed in the Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA), in order to offer the residents cryptocurrency transactions. April 1, 2017  — after a year of preparation, a historic bill was  adopted . The government of Japan was the first in the world to give the status of a legitimate means of payment to most cryptocurrencies, which since then were no longer considered to be commodity-material assets, and hence were no longer subject to value-added tax (VAT), which accounted previously for  8 percent . At the same time, the  law  on cryptocurrency exchanges came into force, designed to protect consumers from fraudulent transactions and help them to distinguish between safe and untrustworthy exchanges. According to the law, all crypto exchanges had to pass the licensing procedure with the FSA by September 2017. It presupposed certain operational requirements for exchanges, including high standards for  cybersecurity , segregation of customer accounts and the verification of their identity. In addition, to obtain a license for carrying out such activities, it was necessary to pay a one-time non-refundable contribution of $300,000. In fact, it was something close to the Japanese equivalent of  BitLicense , introduced in 2015 by the state of  New York . To date, the FSA's license for financial transactions has been received by  sixteen local exchanges , including  Bitflyer , Bitbank, Bittrade, and Bitocean. While about sixteen exchanges received a temporary status of ""quasi-operators"" — a special category of exchanges that started their activities before the introduction of licensing. Another important measure of the new requirements was the global counteraction to  money laundering  (AML). As part of the policy, the Agency  imposed  a ban on anonymous cryptocurrencies, such as  Monero  or  Dash , because of the potential for their use for fraudulent purposes. The official law  came  into force on June 18. How did this affect ordinary crypto traders? On the one hand, after the legalization of BTC and altcoins, 8 percent of VAT has been removed from the total amount of taxes. However, traders didn’t receive complete freedom from taxation-related obligations. In February 2018, the Japanese National Tax Agency  revised  the issue. Now, traders  must pay  the government from 15 to 55 percent, while the profits from forex exchanges and trade promotions were taxed with a fee of up to 20 percent. The amendment triggered  a dual reaction  among market participants, some of which started considering transferring their activities to other states. During one of the  interviews  to Finance Magnates a Japanese crypto influencer Koji Higashi shared his outrage at the taxation in his country, which he considered to be “hurting the industry quite a lot”: “It doesn’t make sense to use Bitcoin as a payment in Japan. Technically, you can buy a car now using Bitcoin, but it doesn’t make sense because of the tax.” On the other hand, cryptotraders in Japan now receives full legal state protection of their activities and assets. For this purpose, Japanese regulators have already sent business improvement orders, related to anti-money laundering ( AML ) and know-your-customer ( KYC ) requirements, to six major cryptocurrency exchanges, Cointelegraph  reported  on June 22.   Due to the high popularity of cryptocurrency in the country and its legal status, the topic of blockchain and digital money is widely covered in media outlets. Moreover, there exists among the traders a lot of so-called ""message boards"" which are widely used for facilitating the search of information –– aggregators of news from various sources, both Japanese and foreign. This practice allows readers navigating successfully in the news background and make correct predictions. Bitcoin accepted Bitcoin in Japan is  accepted for payment  by large companies, including air carriers, hotels and retail chains, as well as by thousands of small sellers. To conduct payment, POS-terminals integrated with cryptocurrency exchanges are used. In Tokyo, these places are mostly situated in the Roppongi area, particularly in restaurants and bars. For example, in  the Hackers Bar  you can drink coffee for BTC and discuss the basics of cryptography with the barista. Living 100% without fiat money in Japan will not be possible at the moment. Payment for metro tickets, renting a house, buying most goods, especially European or American, are still made only for purchase with yen. But, one can always use an extensive network of crypto ATMs. Local cryptocurrencies In addition to Bitcoin, Japan has its universally recognized, ""local"" cryptocurrencies. MonaCoin (MONA)  is the first Japanese cryptocurrency to have one of  the most active communities  on the Internet. This is one of the few currencies in the world that is currently used to purchase online / offline products. MonaCoin is accepted by large restaurants and shops. Cardano (ADA)  is another very popular cryptocurrency in Japan, sometimes called the  ""Ethereum killer""  or ""third generation blockchain"". Cardano  plans  to issue debit cards, which can be transferred to ADA from the Daedalus wallet. In this case, the tokens will be automatically converted into Japanese yens or other local currency, and these ADA cards can be used to withdraw cash from ATMs or to pay for goods in stores. Nakamoto’s successors Japanese opinion leaders include bloggers, businessmen, and politicians. Koji Higashi  has been working in the Japanese crypto business since 2014. He conducts various educational blockchain projects and owns the popular Japanese YouTube channel about cryptocurrencies called  ""Bitcoin Hanseikai"" . He is well-known for his  criticism  of Japan's legislative system in the field of cryptocurrencies and skeptical comments on many altcoins. Miko Matsumura  is the founder of Evercoin crypto exchange and BitBull Capital venture partner. As a  key evangelist  for the Java language and platform he participated in the first wave of the Internet, and devoted himself to the Internet of Value (IoV). During his 25 years career as an executive director in Silicon Valley, he raised more than $50 million in venture capital for start-ups with open source and more than $200 million for ICO projects. Takuya Hirai  is a member of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the author of 2017 law on the legalization of crypto exchanges. Together with representatives of the financial groups Mitsubishi UFJ, Mitsui, and Mizuho; Yuzo Kano, head of the country's largest exchange bitFlyer, and Toshifumi Kokubun, professor at the University of Tama in Tokyo, he is currently  contributing  to the development of the ICO regulation. New type of Japanese businessmen Japan is a state with a unique spirit, culture, and market, whose government was first ready to innovate during the cryptocurrency boom. The introduction of legislative amendments allowed the emergence of a new type of Japanese businessmen – cryptocurrency traders, who annually pay substantial dividends to the treasury. Legalization  has led to a noticeable increase of the popularity of blockchain technology in the country. Bitcoin and altcoins are discussed on central TV channels, and in major news outlets. Promising blockchain start-ups are appearing everywhere, state institutions conduct technological research, and ordinary people can send and accept cross-border transfers without fear of being fined by the government or hacked by fraudsters. Moreover, large players from other Asian countries, such as  South Korea  and  China , have begun to move to the Japanese market, bringing an even larger influx of budget money. While the analysts  expect  that cryptocurrency may contribute 0.3 percent to Japan’s gross domestic product in 2018, the final result that the digital money has brought to the Land of the Rising Sun will be revealed by the annual financial report.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-mysterious-east-decrypting-japanese-crypto-traders,cointelegraph,2018-11-05,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section, Charles Hoskinson: Shifting the Blockchain Tradeoff Profile for the Entire Industry,"With over two thousand altcoins on the cryptocurrency market, it can be difficult to determine what distinguishes them from each other. As an investor, looking into the teams, technology, product and culture behind each coin is a daunting proposition, although that’s the best way to go about crypto investment. Even among the top 10 coins, some enjoy – or rely on – a certain degree of hype, while others maintain their impressive market caps and continue building their products in relative media obscurity. Although Cardano is usually one of such “un-hyped” projects, quietly focused on extensive research and dedicated engineering, the platform has been in the spotlight recently. In the past month, Cardano’s community Guardians of Cardano and the two companies working on the platform’s development, IOHK and Emurgo, have published open letters expressing concerns about the governance and operations of the Cardano Foundation. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK, the engineering company responsible for building the Cardano Blockchain, sat down with U.Today at the StartEngine Summit in Santa Monica to talk about what happened with the Cardano Foundation, the significance of original research and the main purpose underneath it all – providing access to the global financial market for the billions of people who don’t have it. U.Today (Katya Michaels): In the crypto space, often there is an ideological leader associated with a cryptocurrency – Satoshi Nakamoto, Vitalik Buterin, Charlie Lee, Roger Ver. How do you feel about being the person to fill that role for Cardano, and how do you think this kind of idolatry affects the Blockchain community? Charles Hoskinson: It can be a good thing if there is proper balance of powers and the people at the top use their influence to move the currency along. When you start something, you’re very small, very fragile and you need to have a lot of consensus to be able to get things where they need to go. As you get larger over time, you lose your ability to influence the ecosystem unilaterally. There is no greater example than Microsoft. It was a monarchy under a king with absolute power – Bill Gates. Throughout the decades, Gates’s influence waned year by year, and eventually got to a reduced role within the company, until he stepped down from the chairmanship of Microsoft. Cryptocurrencies are no different. People don’t like complicated systems, they are too hard to understand, so what they do is compress a very complicated ecosystem to a single person or a simple idea. When you get bigger, as happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum, eventually that can lead to conflict, and you end up with things like Bitcoin Cash or Ethereum Classic. It’s the great governance challenge in the space – how do you deal with these big personalities, but at the same not allow them to overcome the ecosystem. Another thing is – I’m not perfect, no one is. Eventually, you’re going to let people down. If your entire reason to participate in the cryptocurrency is not its philosophy or its utility, but rather your liking of a person, then at some point that person will say or do something that will disappoint you. So, people leave the space for emotional reasons and create volatility in the currency. UT : Let’s talk about the open letter and the Cardano Foundation. Despite the precautions taken to avoid governance conflicts, you find yourself in this predicament. Was there a better way to do it, in hindsight? CH : I think the checks and balances that were put in place are working properly. The whole reason we build redundant systems is that somewhere along the line one of your systems will fail. So, it’s nice to have at least two, and in our case we had three – IOHK, Emurgo and Cardano Foundation. The issue with the Cardano Foundation is a problem of inaction. For over two years, there were no meaningful investments into community management, into regulatory outreach, into trying to engage the community and build a community-based governance system. We realized that if this trend continued, there was no way to effectively put Blockchain-based governance, the treasury system and the Cardano improvement proposal process in place. We told the foundation there have to be some material changes, and for 15 months they kept saying “we are going to do something” and it never materialized. It really came to a head when the community as a whole, Guardians of Cardano, decided to publish an open letter. At that point, we thought it wouldn’t be too destructive to the Cardano ecosystem if we also wrote an open letter saying that we’re moving on without them. We have already been paid, Emurgo already has its funds, so we can execute autonomously without them – that was the whole point of checks and balances and the foresight of the way we constructed the system. Would we have done things differently? We probably would have been more proactive in the initial setup of the foundation if we got a do over. To be fair to us, though, there were four people on the board from the beginning and there was an understanding that it would be replaced gradually over time with a board of seven people and a strong executive director. The governance crisis got worse because of attrition. The people who were there in the beginning gradually retired and were not replaced, and the people that we thought were going to lead the Foundation were terminated. At IOHK we thought – it’s a big ecosystem, the foundation is not a necessity for the system to be successful, so we’re just going to go ahead and hire our own community managers, our own lobbyists and we’ll do what the foundation was supposed to do. UT : In the letter, you place a lot of emphasis on community. How important is community involvement for Blockchain adoption at this point? Does the public really have to care? Can’t they just be plugged in when the technology is ready, as happened with the Internet? CH : The reason why community is so powerful is that it ultimately gives you a level of resilience that technology can’t. If you take a skin cell, you can replicate its DNA. Structures are resilient if one member of the system can independently go and replicate, rebuilding the entire system, its culture and its technology. It’s super important that people in the community understand the philosophy behind the structure and how it is accomplished, as well as have the skill set necessary to do their own variant in the event that the system becomes ossified and no longer effective. That means sometimes you can have splits, but that also means that you don’t have the 2008 financial crisis which was brought on by over-centralization and over-optimization around concepts that were wrong. It is essential to have people understand decentralization, decentralized control, checks and balances, resilient systems, the ability to replicate a system in the event that most of the nodes die. That means you have to educate people, you have to write great documentation, you have to have infographics, podcasts, do AMAs, often do interviews, conferences, debates, and you have to see people face to face and have conversations with them. That’s how they system propagates. It’s what’s allowed Bitcoin to grow from one person to the massive multinational movement that we have. UT : Even in the community that has adopted cryptocurrency to a certain degree, there seems to be a misbalance in terms of people owning crypto and people running nodes. This technology depends on not just adoption, but active community participation, a new kind of citizenship. How do you mobilize the public to take control of their data, become aware of privacy issues, become a part of the Blockchain fabric? CH : It’s a very difficult task. You’re never going to get people to read the end user license agreement. You have to understand this concept of rational ignorance – the idea that the cost of acquiring knowledge is more than the value of having that knowledge. Right now, there is absolutely no incentive for running a node, so most people don’t do that. If the system is resilient, just a small group of motivated people can ensure its survival. There is actually good evidence that cryptocurrencies have that property. Even if 1 percent of the total user base are running nodes, there is still enough nodes that it would be insanely hard to take the network down. But you can use economic incentives to sculpt consumer behavior – mechanism design – and we have a whole group at IOHK that does nothing but that. Over the next 5-10 years mechanism design will be applied to create monetary incentives for people to run nodes. A great example is the Brave browser. Just by changing from one system to another, the user can make part of the advertising share and have more control over their data and their privacy, and we’ve seen user numbers spike up for Brave as a result. If that model is successful, we’ll observe a sea change in people’s perceptions about why they should own their data, how to host their own nodes, how to take control of their user experience. Some people are very tightly knit into behavior patterns, but you start with early adopters, you create the incentives in a way that they can find sustainable ways of using the system, and eventually those people onboard their friends and family and that becomes the dominant consumer behavior. There is a big democratic experiment occurring right now with Blockchain and treasuries. A Blockchain prints money, and right now we give all that money to the consensus nodes. What if have a decentralized bank account and people can submit ballots to get funding? Dash has done this, PIVX has done this, and we are going to do this with Cardano. The value of having a treasury system is that now people have incentives to stay informed and think about what the best direction for the cryptocurrency is. That’s the new economy and the lessons we learn there can be ported to democracy as a whole. UT : With regulations coming in, there is a move from the “wild wild west” feeling in the space to a more practical approach. Solutions like going off the chain or regulating token offerings may not reflect the pure ideology of cryptocurrency. Is there a sense in the community that this is a betrayal of Blockchain’s original principles? CH : No, it’s not a betrayal of the original principles. People tend to take a particular application of a broad concept and say, “this is the only way to do it” like “this is the only true religion.” That’s a really bad deal. You have every right to have a different view – frankly, you should, because you are a sane thinking human being, and sane thinking human beings have the ability to disagree with each other and often do. Now we have over a thousand altcoins; we have permission ledgers like Hyperledger Fabric. We have a lot of philosophies that are completely contrary to what Bitcoin is all about. The STO revolution is about saying, “look, there are billions of people in the world who lost the geographic lottery and as a consequence, although they have the ability to create value, they can’t get access to capital.” But that person could issue a token, sell that token and use it to capitalize their idea on US markets. The problem with ICOs is that they only cover a certain class of unregulated products. So, what happened was everybody contorting themselves in bizarre ways to try to cram regulated ideas into unregulated products. There is no greater example than EOS. They raised $4 billion dollars and they say we have no fiduciary obligations, we owe you nothing, you could do whatever you want to do, and we could do whatever we want to do with the money. No reasonable person would think that’s ok. The STO makes sure that if you’re actually going to raise money and have fiduciary obligations to people, there’s a regulatory framework what works for both sides. The reason why people aren’t doing traditional IPOs is that they were built in the 20th century. The regulatory framework is too cumbersome, too expensive, the reporting requirements are too high, and they are divorced from any of this technology that we’ve created over the last eight years. There needs to be a middle ground. There were some good ideas in securities regulations – insider trading provisions, proper disclosures of information, conflict of interest. Those checks and balances are good ideas, but all this bureaucratic, cumbersome mess that comes along with it is a bad idea. With STOs, we can automate the bureaucracy so that it costs very little but gives access to capital on a global scale. That’s why I think there is so much excitement. ICOs were super exciting last year because people were getting rich, that always happens with a gold rush, but it’s not sustainable. STOs are sustainable because they are backed by real things – revenue flows, gold, stock, bonds. I think that’s a good step in the right direction. It’s philosophically a bit different from Bitcoin and will require different types of systems than Bitcoin, but in no way invalidates the whole notion that decentralization is good. UT : There is a Blockchain triangle of speed, decentralization and security – like the fast, reliable, cheap triangle where you can only choose two. Where does Cardano fall in that tradeoff? Or are you finding a way not to make that tradeoff at all? CH : The tradeoff profile of any protocol lives within original research. Only original research can move that triangle a little in a direction that will be better at all of those dimensions. You can make it operate at less of a cost, get higher security and better throughput. What we’ve done over the last three years for Cardano is engage academia and use an almost Dartmouth-sized research budget to move the tradeoff profile. First, we defined what exactly we are doing – what is a Blockchain, what is a network, what is a transaction, what is a programming language with respect to cryptocurrencies. Then, once we’ve defined them in a very rigorous way, we wrote a lot of papers. The first step was saying, can proof of work and proof of stake ever have the same security model, or are they so different that you’d give up something when you go to proof of stake? What we discovered with our research is that proof of stake achieves the same security as proof of work. What does that mean? You can do everything proof of work does, but you don’t have to pay the electricity cost. That’s a huge tradeoff enhancement and we’ve been able to do that. In terms of scalability, instead of it being a replicated system where everybody does the same work, make it a distributed system where the work is broken up among people. What’s the tradeoff of that? It’s availability. When you go from a single replicated notion to a group of people doing something, there’s always a possibility that one of your shards doesn’t show up and that basket of work is missing. But there are things you can do – like erasure codes – to chop it up in just the right way to make that tradeoff go down. There is a lot of great research trying to model this – RapidChain by Visa Research and Dfinity, what we’re doing with Ouroboros Hydra, OmniLedger, ELASTICO. At IOHK, instead of taking a position on the matter, we said let’s have a dense research agenda. We will study how to do things off chain and on chain, and study how to shard the chain and be very neutral about different possibilities, and then look at which one will have the best tradeoff profile for what we want to accomplish. If it lives within the amount of decentralization that we want to have and the speed we want to have, then that’s the way we’re going to go and that’s what we’ve done so far. It’s very expensive and time consuming, millions of dollars and 3 years, but we’ve published over 21 papers and I think we have another dozen that are in peer review at the moment. We’ve been moving the science of the entire field along, and we’ve seen a lot of people cite our papers. Real researchers, real conferences, real scientists are now all collectively working on this. Compared to where we are today and where we were 5 years ago, the tradeoff profile has been moved substantially, so we can do these things better and not give up as much.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-shifting-the-blockchain-tradeoff-profile-for-the-entire-industry,utoday,2018-11-08,17:29:00,en
cardano, News ," Crypto Markets See Ongoing Mild Losses, Bitcoin Trades Below $6,400  ","Friday, Nov. 9: crypto markets are  continuing  to see downward momentum, with virtually all of the major cryptocurrencies at least mildly in the red, as data from  Coin360  shows. Market visualization by  Coin360 Bitcoin ( BTC ) is down just over 1 percent, trading around $6,340 at press time. After a period of protracted  stability , the top coin has seen a short-lived burst of price action of late, growing Nov.7 to break above the $6,500 mark. Bitcoin has since corrected downard to trade close to the start of its weekly chart, where it is seeing virtually no price percentage change to press time. On the month, Bitcoin is down a mild 3.6 percent. Bitcoin 7-day price chart. Source: Cointelegraph  Bitcoin Price Index Bitcoin pioneer  Jeff Garzik  – reportedly the “third-biggest contributor” to Bitcoin’s code and one of Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto's key collaborators – gave an  interview  today in which he reflected that: “[Bitcoin]  hasn’t evolved  in the direction of high-volume payments, which is something we thought about in the very early days: getting merchants to accept Bitcoins. But on the store-of-value side it’s unquestionably a success.""   The market’s largest altcoin Ethereum ( ETH ) has also sustained a fractional loss, down just over percent to trade at $211. Correlating with Bitcoin, the altcoin saw an intra-week spike at around $220 Nov. 7, and has since jaggedly shed value down to its current price point. Nonetheless, on the week, the asset remains a strong 6 percent in the green, with monthly losses at around 7.2 percent. Ethereum 7-day price chart. Source: Cointelegraph  Ethereum Price Index Most of the remaining top ten coins on  CoinMarketCap  are in the red, although remaining within a 1-4 percent range. Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) has taken the heftiest hit among the top ten, down just under 4 percent to trade around $567, as controversies ahead of its forthcoming  hard fork  – scheduled for Nov. 15 – continue to  divide  the community. Another top ten alt shaken by larger-than-average losses is Cardano ( ADA ), down 3.19 percent at $0.074. Altcoins Ripple ( XRP ) and Stellar ( XLM ) are the only top ten coins in the green by press time, both up under 1 percent over the past 24 hours. The top twenty coins by market cap are likewise almost unanimously red, with the exception of the 19th largest crypto, privacy-focused alt Zcash ( ZEC ), which is pushing 3.5 percent growth to trade at around $133. For the remaining coins, losses are capped below 4 percent, with Vechain ( VEC ) and DASH ( DASH ) each on the higher end, down 3.9 and 3.47 percent respectively. Total  market capitalization  of all cryptocurrencies is around $212.5 billion as of press time, down from an intra-week high of around $220.7 billion Nov. 7, but above the $207-210 billion levels it held throughout much of the past month.   7-day chart of the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies from  CoinMarketCap In other major crypto news of the day,  ConsenSys -backed  blockchain  startup Kaleido and Amazon Web Services (AWS) have  launched  a full-stack platform that helps enterprises implement blockchain solutions without starting from scratch.

cardano,Markets,Coinbase Adds Zcash to Retail Crypto Trading Service,"Less than a week after adding privacy-focused zcash to its professional trading platform, crypto exchange Coinbase is opening trading to its retail customers. The company  announced Wednesday  that clients using coinbase.com or the Android and iOS apps can buy, sell, send, receive or store zcash, though residents in the United Kingdom and the U.S. state of New York will not immediately have access to these services. The move comes on the heels of Coinbase Pro adding support for zcash  last week . At the time, the platform announced that only residents in the U.S. (excluding New York), UK, European Union, Canada, Singapore and Australia would be able to access the coin. Coinbase's blog post announcing the listing of zcash included information about its privacy features, notably mentioning that users can send either ""transparent"" or ""shielded"" transactions. ""The unencrypted/transparent version of the protocol allows third parties to see metadata associated with the communication or transaction, while the encrypted/shielded version protects this information,"" the post noted (it highlighted similar information in last week's post). As with Coinbase Pro, Coinbase will not be supporting sending transactions to shielded addresses at this time, though customers can send both types of transactions to the exchange. The exchange has now listed  three of five tokens  it first hinted at in July, including the  Basic Attention Token  and the  0x Protocol token . It has yet to add support for the other two tokens, Cardano and Stellar lumens. Brief boost While the ""Coinbase effect"" resulted in zcash's price rising 15 percent last week after Coinbase Pro announced support, Wednesday did not see such a boost. Data from CoinDesk's Crypto-Economics Explorer shows that the coin's price jumped 4 percent briefly to reach a 24-hour high of $75.27. The minor rally proved to be short lived as the cryptocurrency is now trading at $71.94 and is down 3.55 percent on the day. Sam Ouimet contributed reporting.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Boldly Goes Where (Almost) No One Has Gone Before,"EMURGO, the commercial development division of Cardano, has partnered with Metaps, and they have successfully implemented ADA (Cardano’s digital asset) on the Metaps Plus platform. They will launch the first plastic card based on said token, as well as mobile gift cards. The cards can be used to pay at over 30,000 offline retail stores across South Korea and will be available in denominations of 100 and 1,0000 ADA; the cards can also be recharged via mobile apps and can be used in QR code format. With almost 5% gained over the last 24 hours, ADA is currently trading at 0.031 against the US dollar, and the 4-hour chart looks prone for an extended climb. This could be due to recent news of instant payments using crypto cards or simply a technical setup (bullish correction in an overextended downtrend). The main elements to watch during the days to come are the two trend lines, the support at 0.028 and the resistance at 0.034. Currently the bearish trend line is broken, which is a clear sign of buying pressure, and price action has established a 2-point bullish trend line. As long as the latter remains intact, the first target is 0.034 but if we are going to see a stronger recovery, this target needs to be taken out relatively fast. Support zone:  bullish trend line and 0.028 Resistance zone:  0.034 Most likely scenario:  test of resistance Alternative scenario:  return below both trend lines",https://u.today/cardano-boldly-goes-where-almost-no-one-has-gone-before,utoday,2018-12-12,18:05:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Bitcoin, Ripple, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Stellar, Litecoin, Bitcoin SV, TRON, Cardano: Price Analysis, Dec. 26 ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. 2018 has not been a  profitable  year for most asset classes. Tightening interest rates by the United States Federal Reserve, slowing growth, trade wars and fears of a recession have led to a sharp slump in various markets. Leading crypto companies like Beijing-based  Bitmain  Technology, the world’s biggest producer of cryptocurrency mining rigs, and  Huobi  Group, the operator of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges, are  planning  layoffs. While this signals troubled times for crypto companies, such cycles are part and parcel of every industry. However, it is only the crypto asset class that has been facing predictions of an impending demise. In 2018 alone, analysts have written Bitcoin’s “obituary” on numerous occasions. We believe that cryptocurrencies will bounce back in 2019, and will again catch investor’s attention. Nevertheless, the recovery for cryptos will be a slow and gradual process. Unlike before, investors will wait for possibility to become a reality before pushing prices higher. Hence, institutional activity, regulations, and wider adoption will be some of the triggers that will be closely watched. In the short-term, Morgan Creek Digital Assets founder Anthony Pompliano expects Bitcoin to break below  $3,000 . But what do the charts project? Let’s find out. BTC/USD Bitcoin  turned down from the overhead resistance of $4,255 on Dec. 24 and has broken below the 20-day EMA. It is currently trying to stay above the support at $3787.33. The price is stuck between $4,255 and $3,787.33. A breakdown of the support will weaken the pullback and will increase the probability of a retest of the lows. Conversely, if the price holds $3,787.33, it will again attempt to breakout of $4,255. If successful, the recovery can extend to $4,914.11 with a minor resistance at the 50-day SMA. The 50-day SMA is still sloping down and the RSI has also dipped back into the negative territory. This shows that the bears are trying to regain their hold over the  BTC/USD  pair. If either level of the current range does not break, we can expect a few more days of consolidation. There is an outside chance of an inverted head and shoulders pattern if the virtual currency breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above the neckline. Such a breakout has a pattern target of close to $5,500. We can confirm a bottom if the current dip forms a higher low and the next rally makes a higher high. The next few days are critical for the leading cryptocurrency. XRP/USD Ripple  could not sustain above the $0.40 level. Profit booking has pushed prices back below $0.40 and the 50-day SMA. If the  XRP/USD  pair rebounds from the 20-day EMA, it will again attempt to breakout of $0.40. If successful, it can rise close to the resistance line of the downtrending channel. The traders can hold their long positions with stops at the break-even point. A break below the 20-day EMA and $0.33108 will weaken the pullback and plunge the digital currency back to the support line of the channel. The price action of the next 3–4 days will give us a better idea of what to expect. ETH/USD Ethereum  turned down from close to $167.32 on Dec. 24 as we had  expected . Currently, the bulls are trying to hold the 50-day SMA. If successful, we anticipate another attempt to breakout of $167.32. On the other hand, if the  ETH/USD  pair fails to hold the 50-day SMA, it can slide to the 20-day EMA. If the support holds, we expect the digital currency to enter into a consolidation. Our neutral to bullish view will be negated if the bears sink the price below $100. Any break below $83 will resume the downtrend. BCH/USD After its scintillating run, short-term traders booked profits in  Bitcoin Cash  close to the 50-day SMA. Currently, the bulls are trying to bounce off the 20-day EMA but are not finding buyers at higher levels. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the 50. This points to a probable consolidation in the near term. This view will prove to be wrong if the bears sink the  BCH/USD  pair below the 20-day EMA. The next support on the downside is $100. If the bulls bounce off the 20-day EMA and break out of $239, the digital currency will resume its recovery and can reach $262.43 and $307.01. If the price turns down from $239, a consolidation will ensue. We shall get a better picture within the next 3–4 days. Traders who have any partial positions left should continue to trail their stops. EOS/USD The recovery in  EOS  hit a major roadblock at the 50-day SMA. Currently, the bulls are attempting to hold the 20-day EMA. Below this level the next major support is $2.4050. If one of these supports hold, we can expect another attempt to break out of the 50-day SMA. However, if the bears sink the  EOS/USD  pair below the supports, it can retest the lows. The 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to neutral territory. Hence, we anticipate a consolidation for a few days. Our view will be invalidated if the digital currency plummets below $2. XLM/USD As the bulls could not sustain the breakout of the 20-day EMA and $0.13427050,  Stellar  has again dipped back below the 20-day EMA. If the  XLM/USD  pair does not climb back above $0.13427050 quickly, it can slip back to the Dec. 15 low. A breakdown of $0.09285498 will resume the downtrend. The digital currency continues to be an underperformer; hence, we remain neutral on it. We shall wait for the price to sustain above the 20-day EMA and a new buy setup to form before suggesting any trade in it. LTC/USD Litecoin  could not breakout of the overhead resistance at $36.428 on Dec. 24, which started a pullback. The bulls are currently attempting to hold the support at $29.349. If successful, it might result in an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close above $36.428. The pattern target of this breakout is $49.756. However, if the bulls fail to defend $29.349, the pattern will be invalidated and the  LTC/USD  pair can again sink to the recent lows of $23.10. Any violation of the lows will resume the downtrend. We suggest traders wait for the completion of the inverse head and shoulders pattern before initiating any fresh positions. BSV/USD After failing to breakout of the top of the $123.98 and $80.352 range on Dec. 20 and 21, Bitcoin SV is likely to drop to the bottom of the range.   If the  BSV/USD  pair breaks down of $80.352, it can slide to the next support at $65.031. Any break of this level will result in a dip to the low of $38.528. However, if support at $80.352 is held, we expect the consolidation to extend for a few more days. We shall watch the price action at the support and then suggest any fresh positions. Contrary to our opinion, if the digital currency turns around from the current level and breaks out of the range, it can move up to $167.608. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation on a close above $123.98.   TRX/USD The current pullback stalled just below $0.025 on Dec. 24.  TRON  is finding buying support close to the strong support at $0.0183, which is a bullish sign. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover. We anticipate a strong support at the 20-day EMA. After the recent pullback, the  TRX/USD  pair might consolidate between the 20-day EMA and $0.025 for a few days. We shall watch the price action at $0.0183 and then take a call, as we do not find any buy setups at the current levels. If the 20-day EMA breaks down, the digital currency will weaken and again slide to the $0.0125 level. ADA/USD Cardano  turned down from $0.051468 on Dec. 24. We were  expecting  a pullback and as such, had recommended trailing with a close stop loss. Currently, the  ADA/USD  pair is finding support at the 20-day EMA, which is a bullish sign. However, if the bulls fail to bounce off this support quickly, it is likely to give way. The next support on the downside is $0.033065. We expect either one of the above supports to hold. The 20-day EMA is flat but the 50-day SMA continues to slope down. This implies that the long-term trend is still down but the short-term trend is pointing towards a consolidation. We shall get a clearer picture within the next couple of days. A breakdown below the Dec. 7 low will invalidate our bullish assumption. Market data is provided by the   HitBTC   exchange.

cardano, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Tron, Neo, Cardano, Binance Coin, Litecoin ","After a strong start in 2019, the crypto markets have witnessed sharp selling that dragged the prices down by about 10 percent on Jan. 10. This indicates that the process of bottom formation will be volatile. The traders should aim to book quick profits and trail their stops higher to protect any potential profits. The important event that turned the tide in favor of the bears was the 51 percent  attack  on the Ethereum Classic network. The crypto markets had topped on Jan. 7, 2018, reaching a total market capitalization of over  $835 billion . From there, most of the top cryptocurrencies reversed direction causing a huge erosion in wealth. Even after one year, we can not confirm that the markets have bottomed out and are now on the way up. However, in 2019 the prices could by boosted by any positive regulatory developments, Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) approval, or increased institutional interest. Until then, what should the traders do? Let’s study the charts of the top 5 performers among the top coins to gauge the current sentiment. TRX/USD Tron  was the best performer in the past week, as it bucked the trend and stayed comfortably in the green. The company has  acquired  the peer-to-peer torrent client BitTorrent in August 2018. Last week, the latter has  launched  its own Tron-based cryptocurrency called BTT. Justin Sun, the founder of Tron, expects this move to increase the reach of blockchain to hundreds of millions of users. However, Simon Morris, former chief strategy officer at BitTorrent, has  opined  that the Tron blockchain does not have the capacity to manage the transaction volume needed to tokenize BitTorrent. In other news, Tron has  hired  former SEC supervisory attorney David Labhart as its head of compliance. Will the performance of the digital currency continue for the next few days? Let’s find out. The  TRX/USD  pair has mostly been trading inside the range of $0.0183–$0.02815521 since mid-August of last year. Although the bears had broken down of this range in mid-November, they could not capitalize on it. After trading close to $0.011 for about five weeks, the bulls staged a smart recovery that pushed the price above the resistance of the range at $0.02815521. However, the breakout was momentary, as sellers pounced at higher levels, dragging the price back into the range. We anticipate a new uptrend if the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521. Currently, both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to 50 levels, which suggests that range bound action might continue for a few more days. Our view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price back below $0.0183.   Short-term traders can buy closer to the bottom of the range and sell near the top of the range. However, as the price action inside the range can be volatile, traders should keep their positions small. NEO/USD The news of a rumored partnership between the Russian government and  NEO  developers has kept the cryptocurrency buoyed. The expectation is that in order to dodge the United States sanctions, the Russian government is attempting to diversify into cryptocurrencies. If the rumor turns out to be completely false, the price might fall. So, what should the traders do? The  NEO/USD  pair has a tendency to consolidate before breaking out or breaking down. The two previous attempts resulted in a breakdown of the range, followed by extended fall. Currently, the cryptocurrency is again stuck in a range with support at $5.4808 and resistance in the $10–$12 zone. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is also close to the oversold zone. There are no signs of a reversal forming on the charts yet. The previous consolidation had lasted for 13 weeks and the current one has so far been going on for seven weeks. We expect the price to remain stuck in the range for a few more weeks, before it breaks out or breaks down. We suggest investors wait for a trend reversal to be signaled before initiating any long positions. ADA/USD The market participants are awaiting the release of Project Shelly that will help  Cardano  shift from a centralized platform to a decentralized one. Will this upgrade propel the digital currency higher in the near future? What should the traders do now? The  ADA/USD  pair is in a downtrend. It continues to make lower highs and lower lows. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is also in the negative territory. The previous two pullback attempts have been shallow, which points to a lack of buyers. A break of the recent low of $0.027237 will resume the downtrend. On the upside, a move above $0.1 will indicate strength. We suggest traders wait for a bullish pattern to form before buying. BNB/USD Binance  has revealed plans to launch one new token every month of this year through Binance  Launchpad , its exclusive token launch platform. Will this give a much needed boost to the struggling initial coin offering (ICO) market? The  BNB/USD  pair has been trading inside the descending channel for the past few months. The bulls are struggling to break out of the resistance line of the channel. If the bears sink the price below $5.4666, a retest of the recent low at $4.1723848 is probable. If this support breaks, the fall can extend to the support line of the channel. Our neutral-to-bearish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks out of the channel. The pattern target of such a breakout is $15, with a minor resistance at $12. Therefore, investors can wait for a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the channel to initiate long positions. If the price remains stuck inside the channel, buying can be done close to the support line of the channel and profits can be booked closer to the resistance line of the channel. As this is a counter-trend trade, the position size should be about 40 percent of usual. LTC/USD The total amount of  litecoins  in circulation has reached 60 million on Jan. 12. That number represents about 71.5 percent of the total 84 million that can be mined. The last litecoin is expected to be mined somewhere in 2142. In the wake of the 51 percent attack on Ethereum Classic, Charlie Lee, creator of Litecoin has  said  that a decentralized network “must be susceptible to 51% attack,” because otherwise it does not meet the requirements of being decentralized. The  LTC/USD  pair is in a long-term downtrend. The attempt by the bulls to stage a recovery in the past few weeks has hit a major roadblock at $40.784. If the bulls fail to defend the support at $29.349, a retest of the lows at $23.090 will be on the cards. The downtrend will resume if this support breaks. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which shows that the bears currently have the upper hand. However, if the bulls defend $29.349, we anticipate another attempt to break out of the overhead resistance at $40.784 and $47.246. The previous two consolidations had resolved to the downside.

cardano, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Binance Coin, Cardano, IOTA, Neo, Tron ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. Bitcoin ( BTC ) has proven to be in high demand among citizens of smaller nations like Venezuela, whose economic conditions have been adversely affecting their fiat currencies. Now, cryptocurrencies will face another test with the impending Brexit deal. If the United Kingdom is forced to leave the European Union without a deal, experts believe that the pound will be hit hard, and might lose up to a quarter of its value. With such uncertainty, will the market participants turn towards cryptocurrencies as an alternative source of investment or stick to the classical investment vehicles? We believe that digital currencies will make their presence felt because they are likely at the end of their year-long bear market. According to Binance chief executive Changpeng Zhao, their new Jersey-based trading platform has witnessed a  huge  demand. CNBC contributor Brian Kelly expects cryptocurrencies to do well in 2019. Geopolitical tension in the world can  boost  the demand for digital currencies as the investors look to hedge their positions. However, Kelly doesn’t anticipate an approval for Bitcoin ETF this year. BNB/USD Binance  was the top performer among the major coins. The news of the launch of Binance Jersey, a fiat-to-crypto exchange for U.K, and European customers, was cheered by the investors. The company plans to capitalize on the uncertainty regarding Brexit and wants to offer the people an opportunity to  diversify  into cryptocurrencies. Binance also completed its 6th quarterly BNB  token burn , roughly equivalent to $9.4 million. So, will its outperformance continue? Let’s find out. The  BNB/USD  pair is attempting to breakout of the resistance line of the descending channel. For the past four weeks, the bulls have defended the first support at $5.46666. Therefore, we anticipate another attempt to breakout of the channel within the next couple of weeks. A breakout of the channel will start a new uptrend that can carry the virtual currency to $15, with a minor resistance at $12. The traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above the channel and keep a stop loss below $5. Contrary to our opinion, if the bulls fail to breakout of the channel, the bears will try to sink the digital currency below $5.   ADA/USD Cardano developer and CEO of IOHK Charles Hoskinson is excited about the forthcoming Project Shelly update.  Cardano  wallet “Deadalus” can also prove to be a major event, as it aims to be the most secure crypto wallet with a series of inbuilt protections. While some are confident about the prospects of the cryptocurrency, the critics feel that the developments are moving too slowly. After an extended downtrend, the  ADA/USD  pair has been trading inside the range $0.062424-$0.027237 for the past nine weeks. There was a similar attempt to bottom out previously (marked as ellipse on the chart) that resulted in a breakdown. That consolidation had also lasted for nine weeks before breaking down of it. If the bears breakdown of the current range, the downtrend will resume. However, if the bulls scale the overhead resistance of $0.062424, we can expect the start of a new uptrend that can reach $0.094256 and above it to $0.2. As the upside potential is high, traders can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above the range to initiate a long position. IOTA/USD In the new year,  IOTA  has announced a couple of collaborations that can help it come on top. Though it has not run away, it has managed to close in the green in the past seven days. Can it move up from here and crack into the top 10? Let’s see. The  IOTA/USD  pair is currently trading inside a range. After failing to breakout of $0.4037 for four weeks, the bears pushed prices back in the week before. However, lower levels are attracting buying as the bulls try to stage a recovery from close to $0.272 levels. If the virtual currency rises from the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to breakout from $0.4037. If successful, a rally to $0.6, followed by a move to the next overhead resistance of $0.8152, is probable. However, if the bears fail to force a turnaround at the current levels, a drop to $0.2051 is likely. If this support breaks, a retest of the critical support of $0.1427 will be on the cards. The downtrend will resume if this level gives way. NEO/USD NEO  Co-Founder Erik Zhang confesses that he doesn’t watch the daily price action of the virtual currency.  He is more concerned with its development. According to him, Ethereum might overtake Bitcoin in the future, and Ethereum itself will face competition from cryptocurrencies such as NEO. Can NEO reclaim its footing among the top 10 cryptocurrencies? Let’s find out. The  NEO/USD  pair has been trading inside a tight range for the past eight weeks. The attempt by the bulls to scale the range failed in the week before. However, the bears could not push the prices back to the bottom of the range: this shows demand for the digital currency close to $7 level. We expect the bulls to again attempt to break out of the range. If successful, a rally to $16, followed by a move to $20 is probable. Contrary to our expectations, if the bears plunge the virtual currency back below the range, the downtrend will resume. As the previous consolidations had resolved to the downside, we suggest traders wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $10 before initiating any long positions. TRX/USD Tron  has slowly but surely cemented its place among the  top 10  cryptocurrencies. The markets have cheered the plans to launch BTT token, which will run on the Tron and BitTorrent networks. Its founder, Justin Sun, wants people to think of “Tron” whenever they think of any cryptocurrency. The company also announced a tie up with ABCC cryptocurrency exchange to list  tokens  based on Tron’s TRC10 technical standard. However, many developers came out against Tron’s Accelerator contest, as the announcement of winners was delayed and the prize money was slashed at the last moment. What is in store for this cryptocurrency? Let’s find out. The  TRX/USD  pair is range bound between $0.0183-$0.02815521. The breakout of this range in the week before could not sustain, and the price fell back into the range. Last week, the bulls again attempted to breakout of the range but found selling at the resistance line of the range at $0.02815521. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the range, a new uptrend is likely. The first target on the upside is $0.04. The traders can buy on a close above the range and keep a stop loss just below $0.021. If, however, the bears defend the top of the range, a few more weeks of range bound action is likely to continue. The virtual currency will turn negative if the price breaks down of the critical support at $0.0183. Market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Price Prediction – Waiting for a Breakthrough,"Over past few months, ADA has vindicated itself like a stable cryptocurrency when compared to many other coins in the market. So, the team behind cryptocurrency has made real progress with so many plans in play to help the Cardano`s potential. Cardano (ADA) is a third generation open-source blockchain project that attempts to solve problems which have plagued its predecessors. According to their website, ADA is “developing a smart contract platform which seeks to deliver more advanced features than any protocol previously developed”. Also, it’s the “first blockchain platform to evolve out of a scientific philosophy and a research-first driven approach”. Cardano’s cryptocurrency is named ADA and can be used to send and receive digital funds. Cardano itself is a tech platform that will be able to run financial applications and decentralized applications (dApps), which are services that operate on the blockchain. The platform will also be able to run smart contracts and is a rival for Ethereum. Ethereum is dominating the current smart contract picture, but Cardano aims to deliver a more efficient form; it remains to be seen if they can actually deliver on such big promises. Currently occupying the 11th spot in the market cap rankings, Cardano (ADA) is trading a little above $0.038 at the moment. The entire year of 2018 was bearish and even saw ADA drop below its launch price on some exchanges. It’s all been downhill since the big bull run of 2017/2018, and it looks like there’s not much hope of a recovery – at least not yet. The price is flat, with low volatility and low volume, which is a far cry from the bounce up seen in April 2018, which took the price into 0.40 area. It almost looks like the bulls have totally abandoned this cryptocurrency but interestingly, the bears have done so as well. The most important level at the moment is the support at 0.0272 - keep in mind this number will probably be different depending on the exchange you are dealing with. The level is also the all-time low, and a break of it would throw the pair into uncharted territory, meaning that we don’t have any known support below this level. From a Daily chart perspective (above), we can see that resistance sits at 0.055 and at the 100 days Exponential Moving Average (blue line), followed much higher by 0.10 – 0.11 and 0.20. The chart shows clear lower lows and lower highs, so the pair is in a textbook downtrend and is not oversold. Given the low volatility and almost flat movement seen on Weekly charts, this pair should be treated as currently ranging/sideways, but from a long-term perspective all clues point towards a continuation of the downtrend, which will be achieved when/if the all-time low is broken. Daily Chart Support : 0.0272 (the exact price differs depending on exchange) Weekly Chart Support : 0.0272 Daily Chart Resistance : 0.055 and the 100 days EMA Weekly Chart Resistance : 0.11 and 0.20 Most likely scenario : continuation of the downtrend, break of all-time low unless the developers announce something extremely positive Alternate scenario : irregular volatility, range-bound trading, chance for minor upswings if the pair becomes oversold",https://u.today/cardano-price-prediction-waiting-for-a-breakthrough,utoday,2019-01-29,16:26:00,en
cardano, Analysis , Cowboys on the Block: Inside Wyoming’s Race for Crypto Prominence ,"In the first month of 2019, the state of  Wyoming  has performed yet another series of power moves showcasing its continued commitment to becoming America’s new crypto hub, even despite recent changes in political leadership. The incoming governor, Mark Gordon, made room for some blockchain talk in his  inauguration speech , celebrating the state’s innovative approach to regulation and touting a handful of homegrown startups. Over the next couple of weeks, Wyoming’s legislature  erupted  with a series of groundbreaking crypto-related bills that is only comparable to a similar  wave  in March of last year. America’s least populous state, whose economy has been always skewed toward mining and agriculture, looks determined as ever to deliver on the promise to  become  the nation’s “crypto valley.” Consonant with this jaunty tune, blockchain startups have indeed started pouring into the area. Perhaps Wyoming’s biggest signing this year so far is  the relocation  of Iohk, the company behind the  Cardano  blockchain. The  sweeping changes  that the Cowboy State’s lawmakers have recently passed or introduced as bills include defining three categories of digital assets and treating them as property; granting assets designated as virtual currencies the same legal status as money; authorizing banks to hold digital assets in custody;  allowing  corporations to issue certificate tokens that represent shares; and creating a regulatory fintech sandbox aimed at further diminishing any regulatory hurdles to industry startups. These developments look more radical than many of the other states’ recent blockchain-savvy moves, as they often explicitly challenge a variety of disparate federal approaches to crypto regulation. Celebrating the news of another revolutionary piece of crypto legislation from Wyoming, one could wonder: Is this for real? Are they serious about this? What is it they are really shooting for? Putting Wyoming’s newfound crypto drive in a broader context could shed some light on how and why the state of ranchers and miners decided to boldly reach out to the crypto industry. Courting the giants It is not unprecedented for a small state far removed from traditional technology and financial hubs to be courting a burgeoning new industry amid regulatory uncertainty — something that often happens after the initial period of explosive growth. Once a state is willing to tweak its laws to provide a greenhouse level of care and protection to a particular class of enterprises, moving from the comfort of coastal urban areas into some windy plains doesn’t seem like that much trouble any more. An unlikely  romance  between Citibank and South Dakota provides a textbook example. In the early 1980s, when the initial gold rush of early credit card lending business began stalling under the weight of regulations — such as strict interest rate caps — policymakers in the Midwestern state saw their chance. Taking advantage of a Supreme Court ruling that allowed banks to charge the highest interest rate allowed in their home state, South Dakota introduced a batch of lax banking laws and invited banks to feel themselves at home. In 1981, Citibank was the first to respond to the call, bringing thousands of new jobs into the area. The city of Sioux Falls now has about 20,000 financial sector jobs, while South Dakota holds more bank assets than any other state. Another place in the United States that definitely knows how to attract out-of-state enterprises is Delaware. Its hospitality extends beyond just tech businesses, or any specific kinds of businesses, for that matter — the state has long been known as a  tax haven  and is now  home  to almost a half of all U.S. public corporations. More recently, it has seen a surge in limited liability corporations (LLC) registration, thanks to relative ease of incorporation and a small flat LLC tax. Delaware also has a far-reaching statewide  blockchain initiative , which apparently became the inspiration for one of the fresh Wyoming bills. Against the background of the already highly welcoming corporate climate, however, Delaware’s set of blockchain-friendly policies inevitably looks less salient than the Cowboy State’s legislative onslaught. Underlying interests So, how exactly does the influx of digital-money businesses promise to benefit Wyoming? Perhaps the simplest hunch is that the state is looking to capitalize on registration and incorporation fees. Delaware’s example is enticing: Once you have a steady stream of newcomers from all over the place, you can enter a virtuous circle by keeping the fees low and attracting even more enterprises.  State Rep. Tyler Lindholm , who has been behind most of Wyoming’s key blockchain legislation, openly  admitted  to looking at the Northeastern state as a benchmark, and noted that his state was making about $30 million in fees, against Delaware’s $1.2 billion. If there is one thing that is potentially more lucrative than attracting a whole new industry to your jurisdiction, it is harboring a new industry that barely exists elsewhere. This is basically what the  digital asset custody bill  does. By authorizing banks to administer digital assets under the new regulatory framework, Wyoming sets out to reach an ambitious goal of enabling them to comply with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s ( SEC ) regulations for “qualified custodians.” This is nothing less than a bid to establish a regulatory environment that would allow for the entirely new class of services to  emerge  within the state: digital asset custody. It is worth noting that Wyoming’s attraction to blockchain technology is not a standalone phenomenon, but rather a part of a larger effort to diversify the economy. The official commitment to expanding the state’s technology sector is at least seven years old, while the   Economically Needed Diversity Options for Wyoming ( ENDOW ) program  was established in 2017. It was the ENDOW executive council that included  recommendations for legislative action  on several technological initiatives last year, including a series of blockchain-related bills. One more reason to double down on blockchain liberalization has been the flight of money transmitters from the state over the last few years — and the need to get them back.  Contrary to the proclaimed tech-friendly spirit, the  Wyoming Money Transmitters Act , which was passed in 2011 and came into full effect in 2014, imposed cumbersome  licensing requirements on crypto exchanges . This forced Coinbase and a handful of others to halt their operations in the state by 2015. The series of laws enacted last March included provisions that crypto exchanges be exempted from the money transmission laws. A few months later, Coinbase  returned  to Wyoming. Wyoming Blockchain Coalition If some important legislative developments have taken place somewhere in the U.S., probably someone has lobbied for it. Lurking behind all the news reports of Wyoming’s blockchain regulation advancements is the group called the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition, as well as the names of several of its prominent members. Among them,  Caitlin Long  is the undisputed headliner. A Wyoming native with a passion for “honest ledgers,” Long spent more than two decades working for the likes of  Morgan Stanley  before heading the blockchain startup Symbiont. Having realized that she couldn’t legally donate to the University of Wyoming in crypto, Long got the idea that the state law could use some improvement. That’s how the Wyoming Blockchain Coalition came about. Consisting initially of Long and a few of her friends, the group eventually drew in many of the state’s forward-thinking notables. Their names can now be found among those who sponsored the groundbreaking bills. Not only are some state politicians members of the coalition, they are also personally invested in local blockchain enterprises.  Sen.  Ogden Driskill  became involved last year with BeefChain — a Wyoming-based startup that is building an immutable ledger designed to track free-range cattle. Another legislator who often makes  headlines  in crypto media,  Rep. Tyler Lindholm , acts as the chief of ranching operations for the same company. It appears that Wyoming’s impressive push for blockchain leadership relies on several major ingredients. There is evidently a consensus among the elites as to the urgent need for expanding and promoting the state’s technology sector — and somehow they decided that the trendy distributed ledger technology might be their best bet. There is also a tried and tested strategy for small states that are eager to get ahead: tailoring legislation to the needs of whomever they are betting on. Yet, even when all the structural factors are in place, things are unlikely to work unless there are leaders on the ground, who value and understand the innovation they are pushing for. With the blockchain-savvy ranchers of Wyoming, this seems to be the case.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cowboys-on-the-block-inside-wyomings-race-for-crypto-prominence,cointelegraph,2019-01-30,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Monero Price Prediction – Downtrend Continuation?,"Monero was initially launched in April 2014 as a fork of Bytecoin, under the name BitMonero. Ever since its inception the coin has been focused on anonymity, private transactions, and decentralization. Monero’s trading symbol is XMR, it uses the proof-of-work algorithm CryptoNight and is designed to be ASIC resistant (good news for small miners). The protocol uses an obfuscated public ledger and Ring Signatures which mix the sender’s transactions with a group of others. This system makes it more difficult to establish links between sender/receive thus providing anonymity for users. Further, the use of “stealth addresses” makes it impossible for third parties to discover the actual destination address which is known only to the sender and receiver. Mainly due to its privacy-oriented nature, Monero became the cryptocurrency of choice for dark markets users. In the first half of 2018, it was used in 44% of crypto-related ransomware attacks which is a concern for traders and HODL’ers. Currently trading around $43 Monero reached its highest price in early January 2018 when one XMR was worth 496 US Dollars. The privacy coin is now sitting at the 13th spot in market cap rankings with a total supply worth just over $731 million. Similar to almost all other cryptocurrencies in the top 20, Monero (XMR) reached a top in early January 2018 and has been falling ever since. The pair has been printing lower lows and lower highs for the entirety of 2018 which is a staple of bearish trends. This one doesn’t show clear signs of coming to an end. Between June and November 2018, the price of XMR was trading inside the horizontal channel created by 145 resistance and 80 support. It has since exited said channel and is approaching the long-term support at 30 which I consider to be the next target on a weekly chart. The Relative Strength Index has been crawling at the bottom of its range since the beginning of December, but it is not clearly oversold so the only argument for retracement higher remains the fact that the downtrend seems to be losing steam. However, that alone is not enough indication that prices will rise in the near future. On a Daily chart, we can see the same clear downtrend with the pair below the 100 days Exponential Moving Average and lower lows printed on a constant basis. Daily support sits at 38, resistance at 60 and the latest price action is flat, which makes it hard to anticipate the next short-to-medium term direction. However, from a long-term perspective, the pair is headed south so we expect to see a break of 38 followed by a move into 30 and possibly lower. Daily Chart Support:  38 (the exact price differs depending on exchange) Weekly Chart Support:  30 Daily Chart Resistance:  60, 100 days EMA and 80 Weekly Chart Resistance:  80, 145, 310 Most likely scenario:  continuation of the downtrend, move below support Alternate scenario:  extended sideways price action, possible moves up based on downtrend exhaustion; keep in mind these are technical scenarios, which can be invalidated by fundamental developments",https://u.today/monero-price-prediction-downtrend-continuation,utoday,2019-01-30,18:06:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano and Ethereum Co-Founder Charles Hoskinson Joins Predictive Analytics Firm ,"Cardano ( ADA ) CEO and Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder  Charles Hoskinson  has joined predictive analytics firm Endor. The company announced the appointment in a press release shared with Cointelegraph on Feb. 4. Established in 2014, Endor claims to be the first automated predictions engine in the field of business decision-making by means of a  blockchain -based and  artificial intelligence  (AI)-powered analytical platform. Last spring, Endor reportedly  raised  $45 million in a token pre-sale for its predictive analytics technology. According to the press release, Endor has onboarded Hoskinson as a senior advisor, who will provide guidance and counsel in respect to the  cryptocurrency  industry, decentralization, and blockchain strategy. Additionally, Hoskinson will purportedly lead a new strategic project, the essence of which has not been yet revealed. In the press release, Endor’s CEO and co-founder Yaniv Altshuler highlighted Hoskinson’s expertise derived from his work on decentralized public blockchain and cryptocurrency project Cardano and Ethereum. Altshuler also outlined Hoskinson’s involvement in upcoming projects. Recently, Hoskinson  stated  that digital currency markets might need 11 years to regain 2017’s price highs, while the industry will be a “dramatically different ecosystem at that point.” Hoskinson said that the industry will have “millions, perhaps even billion” of users, also stressing that one of the key points for the evolution of cryptocurrencies is to attract institutional investors. Hoskinson’s recent statement echoes those he  made  on  Twitter  in June, claiming that the entry of Wall Street into the crypto sector will bring in “tens of trillions of dollars.” When asked by a commentator what exactly the cryptocurrency community is building, Hoskinson answered “an entirely new world.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-and-ethereum-co-founder-charles-hoskinson-joins-predictive-analytics-firm,cointelegraph,2019-02-04,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Ethereum Has More Than Twice as Many Core Devs per Month as Bitcoin, Report Says ","Ethereum ( ETH ) has the most developers working on its base protocol of all  cryptocurrencies , not counting community project developers, according to a report by crypto asset management firm Electric Capital. The report was published in a Medium  post  on March 7. Per the post, the company fingerprinted over 20,000 code repositories and 16 million commits to obtain data, which reveals that on average 216 developers contribute code to ETH repositories every month. The company also specifies that this data “is undercounting the number of Ethereum developers since we do not include ecosystem projects like Truffle.” Bitcoin ( BTC ), the largest of all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, has a healthy developer base as well, averaging over 50 developers per month. The report specifies that this data does not include ecosystem projects. An even more restrictive data set, which only considers contributions to core protocol, reveals that: “Ethereum is by far the most active at 99 monthly developers on average.” Bitcoin, on the other hand, has an average of 47 core protocol developers every month, making it the second most active. The data also reveals that big platforms such as Eos ( EOS ), Tron ( TRX ) and Cardano ( ADA ) all have over 25 monthly core protocol developers on average. Another point made in the report is that while the market lost about 80 percent since its peak, data shows that the monthly active developer base has fallen by only 4 percent. Moreover, according to the report, the number of developers working on public coin repositories has doubled over the last two years. According to the company’s global data, over 4,000 developers per month contribute code to over 2,800 public coins. As the study notes, this data does not consider private, not yet launched or non-coin projects, such as the Lightning Network. The report also points out that “many projects who [sic] are being abandoned by developers are forks of high network value coins.” For instance, Dogecoin ( DOGE ) hasn’t had developers for months while the Litecoin ( LTC ) developer base has fallen from 40 developers per month to just three over the last year. The report also notes that both Bitcoin Diamond ( BCD ) and Bitcoin Gold ( BTG ) have had code contributions from under five developers since October 2018. As Cointelegraph recently  reported , Ethereum co-founder  Vitalik Buterin  has stated he was trying to solve Bitcoin’s limited functionality with the creation of Ethereum. On the other hand,  Twitter  and  Square  CEO Jack Dorsey  alluded  to spending $10,000 per week on Bitcoin during a recent podcast.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-has-more-than-twice-as-many-core-devs-per-month-as-bitcoin-report,cointelegraph,2019-03-09,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Price Shows Good Growth — Will the Latest Upgrade Mean a Spike for ADA?,"Cardano is one coin that is showing decent growth amongst a sea of small losses today. Is it because project Shelley is on the horizon, thanks to Cardano 1.5, an improved consensus protocol, that the price of its token, ADA, is on the move? Cardano is an interesting project, and it is one that has been focused on quality, by its own admission. It has been rather slow with its upgrades: it has been three years now, and after active research and trailblazing, the testing of Cardano 1.5 marks the end of the Byron development phase as project Shelley makes its way through the door. This is an important milestone for Cardano that allows for proper consensus protocol transition from Ouroboros BFT to Genesis designed for Shelley. But the question that needs to be asked is, will this upgrade of the project lead to good growth for ADA? What has become evident in terms of cryptocurrency investing, especially with altcoin projects, is that there have been positive reactions to good news, as well as positive advancements in the projects. One clear proponent of that is Binance Coin. The native token of Binance is flying in the first quarter of 2019 thanks mostly to the fact that Binance, as an exchange, is performing well and advancing its own work in a positive manner. There have been boosts for tokens such as Litecoin and EOS as they have posted good news about their own adoption and advancement as projects, and now, with Cardano doing the same, the positivity is having an effect. In general, the cryptocurrency market has been trading mostly flat, with some incremental growth over the last seven days. However, today marks a day of mostly red numbers, although they are predominantly small losses. ADA is, however, up 2.5 percent, and looking across the last seven days there has been steady growth – the kind of growth one expects from good work within the project rather than just speculative investing.",https://u.today/cardano-price-shows-good-growth-will-the-latest-upgrade-mean-a-spike-for-ada,utoday,2019-03-12,09:38:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Stellar, Bitcoin Cash, Cardano, Dash, Monero ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. The crypto markets are showing the first signs of bottoming out. Most cryptocurrencies are well above their yearly lows and are starting new uptrends. Every bull phase has a new set of leaders. Therefore, it is important to note the digital currencies that are pulling the market higher, as these are the ones that are likely to outperform during the move upwards. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance continues to drop gradually since reaching a high of about  57.80  percent in mid-September. This shows that the market participants are loading up on  altcoins . However, a new bull phase cannot start without support from the leading cryptocurrency. The good news regarding Bitcoin is that it has stopped falling and is gradually moving  higher . Its volume topped $11 billion over the 24-hour period on March 15, a level not seen since April 25 of last year. This shows that market participants are gradually turning bullish on the leading cryptocurrency. As the crypto universe emerges from its prolonged bear phase, there will be periods when Bitcoin will lead and other times when altcoins will lead. So, traders should change their strategy accordingly. XLM/USD Stellar ( XLM ) is the best performing major cryptocurrency of the past week. It rallied on the back of favorable news, as Coinbase Pro announced  support  for Stellar on March 13. This move will likely eventually lead to full support on Coinbase’s other platforms. The  appointment  of Denelle Dixon, former chief operating officer at Mozilla, as the CEO and executive director of Stellar Development Foundation also served as bullish news. Additionally, IBM’s  push  to create a stablecoin targeting blockchain-powered cross-border payment solutions for banks involves a partnership with the altcoin in the form of  Blockchain World Wire . The question is, can this adoption and development-based rally continue or will it hit a roadblock ahead? Let’s take a look at the charts. The  XLM/USD  pair is in a downtrend. Both the moving averages are still down and the RSI is in the negative zone. Currently, it is attempting to pullback from the lows, which will face resistance at $0.14861760 and above it at the downtrend line. We are yet to see a higher high and a higher low being formed, which will indicate that the downtrend is over. Therefore, for long-term investors, we don’t see any reliable buy setups yet. If the pair turns down from the 20-week EMA, it will again attempt a breakdown to new lows.    BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) was the second-best performer for the week, rising about 15 percent. Though there was apparently no specific news driving prices higher, the digital currency has a history of vertical rallies and waterfall declines. Let’s see where it goes from here. After many small range weeks, the  BCH/USD  pair is looking to move up. The current move is likely to carry it to the 20-week EMA, which is just below the horizontal resistance of $239. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of $239, we anticipate the pair to pick up momentum and rally to $400. The digital currency has a history of sharp rallies; hence, the target might surprise to the upside. Contrary to our assumption, if the cryptocurrency turns down from $239, it might extend its stay in the range for a few more weeks. It will turn negative if the bears sink the price below $105. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) announced this week that it will be one of the  founding  members of the  European Commission’s International Association for Trusted Blockchain Applications. The association is an effort to identify the improvements blockchain technology can bring to various industries and formulate a common approach for the European Union. The  ADA/USD  pair has been range bound between $0.036815 and $0.051468. We like it when a digital currency forms a large basing pattern after a prolonged downtrend. Previous attempts to breakout or breakdown of the range did not find any takers. Currently, the bulls are trying to breakout of the range once again. The 20-week EMA is just above this level, which might also act as a roadblock. If the digital currency scales above the 20-week EMA, we anticipate a quick rally to $0.082952 and above it to $0.094256. Therefore, traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $0.051468 and keep a stop loss of $0.0350. Opposite to our expectations, if the digital currency turns down from the current levels, it will extend it stay in the range for a few more weeks. A breakdown of the range will be a negative sign that can result in a retest of the lows, below which the downtrend will resume. DASH/USD Dash ( DASH ) has been making huge inroads in Venezuela as the citizens look at various available avenues to deal with the unstable Bolivar and foreign sanctions, which threaten to  derail  SWIFT, Visa and MasterCard services. Dash Text has come up with a charity system that is devoid of any human third-party  intervention . The donations are directly distributed among the pool of recipients. In other news, Equicex Group, the provider of privacy-focused debit cards, has decided to  integrate  Dash, which increases the options available for Dash users. The  DASH/USD  pair continues to trade between $56.214 and $103.261. The bulls are attempting to push prices above the resistance of the range. The 20-week EMA is placed just below $103.261 levels. We expect the bears to defend this resistance. If the price turns down, then the consolidation will stretch out for a few more weeks. The trend will turn negative if the bears sink the digital currency below the range. Conversely, if the bulls succeed in breaking out of the overhead resistance, it can move towards the next levels of $175 and $224. Aggressive traders can buy a breakout and weekly close (UTC time frame) above $103.261. The initial stop loss can be kept at $56 that can be quickly raised if the price moves northwards or fails to build upon gains following the breakout. XMR/USD In Monero ( XMR ) news, the altcoin completed a hard fork on March 09 that will help improve its privacy, security and ASIC resistance. Following the update, the hash rate of the Monero network plunged by about 90 percent from 1.14Gh/s to 162.14Mh/s. Additionally, two new Monero trading pairs were added by top global exchange Binance. Given these developments, the cryptocurrency came out this week as the fifth best performer. Can it improve upon its performance? The bulls are attempting to carry the  XMR/USD  pair above the resistance of the range at $60.1470 and the 20-week EMA at $62.50. If successful, a quick rally to $81, followed by a move to $114.840 is probable. The long-term target is $150. Traders can buy on a close above $62.5 and keep a stop loss of $38, which is just below the bottom of the range. As the price moves higher, we would suggest trailing the stops higher to reduce risk. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the virtual currency will remain range bound for a few more weeks. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown of the current range. Market data is provided by the   HitBTC   exchange.

cardano, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: ONT, ADA, ETC, BCH, IOTA ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. As the cryptocurrencies are rising from the bottom, we have started to hear some bullish voices again. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of BitMEX, expects the price of Bitcoin to reach  $10,000  this year. One of the events that can cause the price to move northward is the launch of Bakkt. The digital platform’s launch has reportedly been getting  delayed  due to compliance issues, as it planned to have custody of its customers’ Bitcoin. Nonetheless, the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has said that it is  working  on all the various crypto-related applications, including Bakkt. So, it could be only a matter of time before they get the green signal. After the long bear phase, the current recovery is being led by various altcoins. Though the leader, Bitcoin, has only been crawling higher, the altcoins are seeing some sharp gains from the lows. The rise has reduced the dominance of Bitcoin in the past few weeks. In order to cover the altcoin rally better, we have chosen the top five performers among the coins that have a market capitalization of greater than $500 million.    ONT/USD Ontology is the top gainer of the past week, as the markets cheered the various announcements made in the past few days. Ontology entered into a  partnership  with MovieBloc, a new participant-centric film distribution platform, that is backed by Korean video streaming platform Pandora.tv. Li Jun, founder of Ontology,  said  that the project had completed a loyalty-based points solution for Fosun, a Chinese international conglomerate and investment company that has about 100 million users. Ontology is also working on chemical supply chain tracking for the Lanxess group. Will the rally continue or will the traders book profits? Let us find out. The  ONT/USD  pair is in a smart pullback after hitting a low of $0.43598112 in December of last year. It is currently in the midst of forming a rounding bottom, which will complete on a breakout above $2.26296972. The minimum target objective of this reversal pattern is $4.08995832. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is turning up. This shows that the bears are losing their grip. We expect the bears to mount a strong defense at the current levels. But if the bulls scale and sustain above $1.22947704, the recovery can extend to $2.26296972. Short-term traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $1.22947704 and keep a stop of $0.78. This is a risky trade; hence, please keep the position size to only about 40 percent of normal. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) completed a successful  upgrade  to version 1.5, which is the last major release of the Byron development phase. This update is an important step for moving to the Shelley development phase. After the rally, where does the price go from here? Let’s find out. The  ADA/USD  pair has risen sharply in the past seven days: it has broken out of the range and has risen above the 20-week EMA, which is a positive sign. It should now rally to $0.082952 and if this level is crossed, the next target is $0.094256. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has also risen to the midpoint. This shows that the trend is changing. Traders can buy 50 percent of the desired allocation on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $0.051468, and buy the rest on a minor dip to the breakout levels. We are recommending two different buy levels because strong breakouts do not retrace, so if the pair continues to move up, the traders will have some chips in the game. But on most occasions, breakouts pullback; if that happens, we want to buy at lower levels. The stops can be kept at $0.0350. ETC/USD The week saw the  resignation  of Anthony Lusardi from his post as the U.S. director of the Ethereum Classic Cooperative. However, he reiterated that he will continue to be involved with the ETC cooperative and will do some side/programming projects for Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) and Bitcoin. He said that the social media pressures had become difficult for him to handle, leading to his resignation. Nevertheless, the price of the cryptocurrency did not take a hit due to the departure.     The  ETC/USD  pair is attempting to form a base near the lows: it can move up to $5.889.  The 20-week EMA is also located close to this level; therefore, we anticipate a strong resistance at $5.889. If the bulls push the price above $5.889, it can rally to the next overhead resistance of $9.50. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and weekly close (UTC time frame) above $5.889 and keep a stop loss at $3.3. If the digital currency turns down from $5.889, it might prolong its stay in the range for a few more weeks. It will weaken if it breaks below $3.3. BCH/USD Swiss-based cryptocurrency ATM operator Värdex Suisse has added support for Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) on its devices. Swiss online retailer Digitec Galaxus will  also now accept  cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin Cash is one of the many digital currencies on the list. The bulls have carried the  BCH/USD  pair to the first overhead resistance of $163.89. Above this level, the digital currency can move to the next overhead resistance of $239. The 20-week EMA is located just below this level. Hence, we anticipate a stiff resistance close to $239. The digital currency has a history of vertical rallies, so if it breaks out of $239, the move can reach $400 and higher. Conversely, if the bears defend $239, the pair might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks. We do not find any buy setups at the current levels. IOTA/USD The crypto payments startup Zeux will add  IOTA  as a mode of  payment  at various stores that accept Samsung Pay and Apple Pay. Zeux will launch in Europe in April of this year, and will hit the U.S. in 2020. How does the future look on the charts? Let’s see. The  OTA/USD  pair is attempting a basing pattern near the lows. It is likely to rise to the 20-week EMA and above it to $0.4081. We expect the bulls to mount a stiff resistance at this level. If the price turns down from here, it will remain range-bound for a few more weeks. The trend will turn down if the digital currency breaks down to new yearly lows. On the other hand, if the price scales above $0.4081, it can move up to $0.560 and above it to $0.6499. After this level is crossed, the rally can reach the stiff overhead resistance of $0.8152. We shall wait for the price to sustain above $0.4081 before proposing any trade in it. Market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.

cardano,Markets,Staking Startup Claims 'Up to 30%' Returns for Just Holding Crypto,"Blockchain staking-as-a-service startup Battlestar Capital says customers can earn a return of “up to 30 percent” annually on their idle cryptocurrency holdings. Revealing the news exclusively to CoinDesk on Tuesday, Battlestar said that it has partnered with cryptocurrency lending startup Celsius Network to launch a large-scale staking service that provides the potentially high returns. While the announcement did not provide a lower guide for the estimated returns, its  website  currently states that returns could also be as low as five percent annually via its staking service. Individuals and funds who do not have expertise or time to manage the day-to-day tasks of staking – supporting a  proof-of-stake  (PoS) network by holding its token and getting rewards in return – would benefit from the service, Battlestar said, as it protects investors' holdings, as well as providing portfolio yield. “Most custody players sidestep staking, and most staking agencies avoid custody because of the risks. Battlestar strategically combines both under one roof,” said Meltem Demirors, an advisor to the company. Battlestar Capital CEO Adam Carver said: “After bitcoin['s] significant 85 per cent price drop, investors looked to diversify their portfolio through staking other coins. PoS coins [have] emerged as a profitable avenue for investors – including bitcoin maximalists – to gain sizeable yield with their passive holdings.” Celsius Network aims to add “at least five” more PoS coins (likely tezos, zcoin, decred, horizen and cardano) to its existing 17 crypto assets “over the next three months,” according to a statement. “Battlestar makes hosting masternodes, like Zcoin’s Znodes, more accessible,” said Zcoin’s chief operating officer, Reuben Yap. “One of their unique features is the use of a secure MPC [multi-party computation] key solution, which fragments a private key and stores its pieces separately to eliminate the risk of a single entry point."" Battlestar said it has been privately participating in PoS networks since December 2017 when its founders developed a series of algorithms to optimize staking rewards. UPDATE (March 26, 19:35 UTC):  A sentence in an earlier version of this article misdescribed the return users can earn with the Battlestar service. It is a block reward for staking coins, not interest. The passage has been corrected.

cardano, News , IOHK Founder Charles Hoskinson Says Crypto Industry Needs More Interoperability ,"Charles Hoskinson , a founder of IOHK, the firm that developed cryptocurrency Cardano ( ADA ), said that the cryptocurrency industry needs a “WiFi or Bluetooth moment” in an  interview  with media outlet Cheddar on March 28. Speaking about the status of the  cryptocurrency  industry, Hoskinson said that it needs specific standards that will facilitate the development of more interoperability. Per Hoskinson, it will allow communication and information to be traded in an easier way among both digital currency and traditional financial institutions. Hoskinson argued: ""What we are seeing is a collection of standards being created [that] will inevitably converge over the next three to five years to create a situation where you can move information and value between all these different systems ー not just  Bitcoin  to  Litecoin  to  Ethereum  to Cardano ー but also your regular  bank  account."" Hoskinson said that ""what we are looking for is the WiFi or Bluetooth moment of our industry. We haven't quite gotten there yet."" Standard-setting organizations have been expanding and gaining traction recently. Last month, The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) — an Ethereum blockchain standards-setting organization with over 500 members —  confirmed  it will launch a “token task force” in 2019. The group will reportedly focus on the issue of interoperability between different blockchains, as well as contribute to entreprise tokenization and build public confidence in crypto. That same month, the EEA  opened  a regional office in  China , wherein Weijia Zhang, vice president of engineering at blockchain interoperability startup Wanchain, was appointed as the head for the new regional office. Zhang will reportedly be responsible “for supporting the advancement and adoption of EEA’s standards by taking part in local hackathons, workshops, training sessions, and conferences.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/iohk-founder-charles-hoskinson-says-crypto-industry-needs-more-interoperability,cointelegraph,2019-03-29,00:00:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: Tezos, Cardano, EOS, Binance Coin, Neo ","The crypto community will have to wait till the second half of May to know the fate of the Bitcoin ETF applications by VanEck and Bitwise, as the US SEC has again  delayed  its decision. Very few people expect the Bitcoin ETF to see the light of the day in 2019. Hence, even if it is not approved, the impact on crypto prices is likely to be limited. However, if the ETF is approved, it will be a pleasant surprise and will give a major boost to crypto prices. Currently, the recovery is not led by Bitcoin: it is the altcoins that are dragging Bitcoin prices higher. Based on options data, traders are giving only a  5 percent  chance for Bitcoin to reach $10,000 by September of this year. We believe that if the bulls succeed in breaking out of $4,255, the markets will start pricing in a greater probability of touching higher levels this year. Though we expect some sharp rallies during the year, we do not anticipate them to be similar to 2017. Argentina’s deputy minister of finance, Felix Martin Soto, said that promoting crypto will reduce the demand for  U.S. dollars  in the Latin American nation and stabilize the local markets. Increasingly, nations are warming up to the vast potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. This will attract more investors to the asset class, as they see the transformation that the technology can bring about in their economies. Though slow in catching up, price will eventually follow fundamentals, and altcoins have been soaring in the past few weeks. Let’s look at the best performers of the past seven days. XTZ/USDT Tezos ( XTZ ) has been one of the stronger altcoins in the past few days, as its price has been buoyed by some fundamental events that brought cheers to the investors. The community has completed voting on the protocol proposal that will decide the  upgrade  of Tezos, and the proposal is now entering an  Exploration Vote Period  (or “Testing_vote period”). The markets also cheered the additional  grant  received by Cryptium labs to develop baking and consensus improvements for the Tezos core protocol. Coinbase Custody is offering staking services with Tezos ( XTZ ) to attract institutional players, wherein investors can make about  6.6 percent  annual return and a client’s assets will be kept in a cold storage at all times, making the process risk-free. The Tezos foundation intimated that PwC Switzerland has completed the 2017 statutory  audit , and that the same has been filed with the Swiss Federal Supervisory Authority for Foundations. PwC is also conducting the audit for 2018. With these positive fundamental developments, can the rally continue or will it hit a roadblock? Let’s find out.   The  XTZ/USDT  pair traded in a tight range of about 16 weeks before breaking out to the upside. Last week, though the breakout of the $0.33-$0.654310 range could not be sustained, the pair has followed it with another up move this week. This shows a likely change in trend. In this up move, the digital currency has broken out of the 20-week EMA and can now rally to the 50-week SMA at $1.73. There is a minor resistance at $1.295480, but we expect it to be crossed. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to scale $1.294580, the digital currency might consolidate for a few more weeks. The recovery will lose steam if the price plummets below $0.654310 once again.   ADA/USD The official arm of Cardano ( ADA ) announced that the popular Ledger Nano S now  supports  the cryptocurrency, which will help users hold their assets securely. Also, 19 Ethiopian and four Ugandans students  graduated  from IOHK’s Haskell Course: these software developers will use blockchain technology to solve various problems in the Ethiopian agriculture industry. Charles Hoskinson, founder of IOHK, expects that in about three to five years, information can be moved between different systems, noting that the crypto industry is still  waiting  for the “WiFi or Bluetooth moment.” The  ADA/USD  pair has extended its recovery with another strong week: it is now nearing the overhead resistance zone of $0.082952 to $0.094256. If the bulls scale this zone and the 50-week SMA that is just above it, a rally to $0.20 in the medium-term is possible. However, in the short-term, we expect $0.082952 to $0.094256 to act as a strong hurdle. A few weeks of consolidation close to this zone cannot be ruled out. On the downside, any pullback is likely to find support at the 20-week EMA and below it at $0.051468. If the bulls fail to defend this support, the pair will again weaken. Traders who have purchased 50 percent of their desired allocation on our  previous  recommendation can continue to hold with the stop at $0.0350. We shall watch the price action for one more week and then suggest trailing the stops higher. EOS/USD EOS  continues to hold the first  position  in the Chinese government-sponsored rankings of major cryptocurrencies, and Weiss Crypto Ratings gave a  ranking  of “A” to EOS for its challenge to Ethereum. As of January,  48 percent  of DApps users were on EOS, way higher than the 28 percent on the Ethereum network. In another  hack  on the Bithumb exchange, more than 3 million EOS was transferred out from the exchange’s hot wallet. Let’s see how the price is reacting to this news. After consolidating for about four weeks, the  EOS/USD  pair has resumed its recovery. It will now again attempt to breakout of the overhead resistance at $4.4930. If successful, it can rally to $6.8299. The 50-week SMA is just below this level; hence, we expect $6.8299 to act as a major roadblock. But during the next pullback, if the pair manages to stay above $4.4930, it will indicate strength and will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Following a breakout above $6.8299, we expect the virtual currency to pick up momentum. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint: this shows that the selling pressure has reduced and a new uptrend is likely. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price fails to climb above $4.4930 and breaks below $3.8723. BNB/USD Binance  announced a new  lottery format  for the next token sale on Binance Launchpad. This is a change from the first-come-first-serve basis that was used for the previous successful token launches. Binance has also  partnered  with risk management and compliance firm IdentityMind to improve data protection and compliance for Binance’s global operations. The week also saw reports that many crypto exchanges were reporting fake volumes. The CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, welcomed these  reports , as it will help to make the industry more transparent. The  BNB/USD  pair is leading the altcoin recovery from the front. After the recent recovery, it is only about 35 percent from the lifetime highs hit in January 2018. This shows that select cryptocurrencies have emerged from their bear markets and are on track to challenge the lifetime highs. Currently, the pair is facing some profit booking at the major resistance of $18. We anticipate a few more weeks of consolidation, or a minor correction before the bulls again attempt to breakout of $18 and make a new lifetime high. On the downside, the digital currency will find support at $14 and below it at the 20-week EMA. The moving averages are completing a bullish crossover, which shows that the trend has changed. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the digital currency breaks down and sustains below the 50 percent retracement of the recent rally. NEO/USD NEO  prices received a  boost  when Nash.io, a decentralized exchange built on top of NEO, announced that it has finalized the protocol spec for Bitcoin trading. In another news, Binance has added  additional  stablecoin pairings for NEO that might help drive up the volume for the cryptocurrency. The  NEO/USD  pair has reached the top of the $5.48080-$10.00 range, and is currently facing resistance at the 20-week EMA. The rise from the low of the range to the current levels has been gradual, which shows an accumulation by the bulls. If it breaks out of the 20-week EMA, it might pick up momentum and rally to $17 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $24. On the other hand, if the price turns down from the current levels once again, it might extend its stay in the range for a few more weeks.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-overview-tezos-cardano-eos-binance-coin-neo,cointelegraph,2019-03-30,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cryptocurrency Exchange IronX Launches Following $26 Million ICO ,"Cryptocurrency  exchange IronX has launched for the public following a $26 million initial coin offering ( ICO ), technology-focused media outlet The Fintech Times  reported  on April 4. IronX is a regulated trading platform that was jointly  established  by digital trading firm IronFX and EmurgoHK, developers of the ninth-largest crypto by market cap, Cardano ( ADA ) in October of last year. IronX’ users can now trade in both  fiat currencies  like the U.S. dollar, euro, and Japanese yen and cryptocurrencies. The exchange supports Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), PumaPay (PMA), ADA,  EOS , Litecoin ( LTC ),  NEO , Stellar ( XLM ), Ripple ( XRP ) Tezos ( XTZ ), and its native token IRX. Prior to trading, customers will have to register on the platform and pass Know Your Customer ( KYC ) approval. After that, they will reportedly receive 10 IRX automatically. The exchange is reportedly going to add more listed cryptocurrencies and features at a later date. As Cointelegraph  reported  earlier this week, ICO analytics website TokenData found that in the first quarter of 2019, about $118 million had been raised through ICOs, which is over 58 times less than the $6.9 billion raised during the same period in 2018. The report also revealed that of the 2,500 projects that TokenData tracked since 2017, only 45 percent successfully raised money. In February, a survey of institutional investors conducted by the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC)  revealed  that 19 percent believe that digital assets will be regularly invested in and traded by 2021. Per the survey,  41 percent believe that institutional investors will only enter the ICO sector in the next five years, although 23 percent said that they do not see investment potential within the ICO market.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-exchange-ironx-launches-following-26-million-ico,cointelegraph,2019-04-04,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Charles Hoskinson Criticizes ETH, EOS's ‘Lone Samurai’ Development Approach ","Charles Hoskinson , the co-founder of Ethereum ( ETH ) and IOHK, the company behind Cardano ( ADA ), has criticized Ethereum and  EOS’s  approach to development. Hoskinson made his comments during an interview with business news outlet Fortune  published  on April 9. During the interview, Hoskinson noted that most protocols publish all their code  open source  and free from  patents , explaining that ideas which  Cardano  or most other crypto development teams come up with can be used by other teams. This, he claims, is different from EOS’s approach and the way in which Ethereum’s Proof-of-Stake ( PoS ) algorithm  Casper  is being developed: “This is a stark contrast to the development you see with things like EOS or with Ethereum with Casper, where they kind of adopt this lone samurai viewpoint.” Hoskinson noted that Ethereum and EOS’s approach to development, which centers around strong leadership by Vitalik Buterin or Dan Larimer and a group of engineers, leads to nothing getting done. He points out that “if you look at going to the moon, over a million people were involved in that megaproject,” in reference to the literal  moon landing  in 1969. During the interview, Hoskinson also addresses what he defined as a governance crisis in the cryptocurrency industry. He pointed out that Bitcoin ( BTC ) development needs important decisions to be made, for instance in regards to the implementation of Schnoor signatures or better sidechain support. Still, while such implementations would reportedly represent a dramatic improvement in Bitcoin’s usability in the views of many, they also introduce more complexity and risk to the system in a way that could compromise BTC’s current value. How to solve such debates is still unclear, according to Hoskinson. EOS seems particularly relevant when it comes to cryptocurrency governance problems. As Cointelegraph  reported  in October last year, its nodes (called block producers) have reportedly colluded and mutually voted for each other, resulting in backlash in the crypto community. At the end of March, Hoskinson had also  called  for a WiFi or Bluetooth moment in the cryptocurrency industry, referring to the need for greater interoperability.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-criticizes-eth-eoss-lone-samurai-development-approach,cointelegraph,2019-04-09,00:00:00,en

 Markets have evidently taken a hit — if not a major tumble — following yesterday’s news of the  hack  of prominent crypto exchange Binance. As Cointelegraph reported, the platform suffered a major and premeditated hack, reportedly conducted by tactics that included phishing and viruses to obtain a large number of 2FA codes and API keys.

cardano,No Section,The Best Cardano Wallets 2019,"One of the most unique crypto assets, Cardano combines the innovations of Bitcoin and the flexibility of Ethereum. Consisting of several layers, its blockchain can be customized to be used in banking infrastructure, aeronautics and other spheres. Besides, its soft forks allow users to choose which updates they need and which they don't. If you've decided to diversify your crypto portfolio by adding Cardano, you should take care to find a reliable storage system for it. In this detailed guide, we will observe the worthiest Cardano storage solutions to keep your riches safe and sound. You ought to think about personal needs. Here are aspects to give careful consideration to: Ideally, a user should have a mix of wallets for various purposes. It guarantees higher security and easy management of your computerized assets. There are 4 primary classifications of ADA wallets, each with its pros and cons. These are gadgets that resemble a USB, similarly being connected to a client’s PC. A hard wallet stores private codes inside and can be accessed only when the proprietor enters a PIN. His advanced money can't be accessed through the Internet — direct association with the contraption is required. It's called cold stockpiling and is viewed as the safest option for putting away resources. The fundamental disadvantage is a moderately surprising expense of the arrangement. These are web sites that enable clients to create their customer area with their own Cardano wallet. It implies that ADA is practically put away on outsider servers. In view of the risk of hacking, this strategy is considered not protected. Notwithstanding, it depends on the site you deal with. In this situation, the software is installed on a PC or use a mobile application. Private keys are put away on the gadget and never go online. This is a moderately safe technique for crypto stockpiling unless your PC is defenseless against viruses and malware. Such a suite may take gigabytes of space, not mentioning some essential IT skills and abilities, so it should be utilized by IT-savvy folks. It’s the safest method for crypto stockpiling. A client's private and open keys remain printed on paper. It is typically placed in a bank safe for storage. Even if it seems to be obsolete, this technique is still significant and reliable. This is an open-source official ADA wallet that works with the Cardano protocol and ensures 100% protection. It’s made to simplify user experience: the installation procedure is intuitive and fast, especially for Macs. Personal keys stay encrypted on customer’s gadget so as to not leak online. As for the wallet's functionality, it allows for managing ADA transfers and getting an insight into the transaction logs. In the future, Cardano creators want to enable third-party developers to make their own apps based on the blockchain, which might enrich the scope of available tools. Daedalus also supports the creation of ADA paper wallets, so it's ideal for both cold and hot storage. When it comes to this mobile ADA wallet, customers enjoy decent functionality and client support. The app boasts excellent security and 24/7 backup for users. The blockchain connection is constantly updated, which makes for excellent transaction speed. Convenience is enhanced by the list of frequently used addresses and messages that can be pinned to every transaction. Infinito does not disclose user keys to anyone — codes never leave their smartphones. Make sure to remember password and passphrases to retain access to your wallet! Otherwise, you won't restore it. For more adaptability and client availability, use the lightweight Yoroi Wallet. Created a year ago, it quickly became a top pick among crypto holders. EMURGO's Yoroi Wallet is enjoying top stats! ?We are happy to announce that  #Yoroi  Wallet reached #1 in Productivity apps (Top New Free category) in the google play store, Japan! (currently #2) Thank you for downloading and reviewing the  #Yoroi  wallet app. RT and download Yoroi!  pic.twitter.com/aAr1K0A6VV It’s available as a Google Chrome extension. It's made to be safe, quick, and intuitive. The private keys are encoded and never imparted to their servers, or any outside supplier. Mobile apps have recently hit the market, and the dev group additionally plans to add more languages, support for different programs, hardware wallet coordination, and features to send out exchange histories to Excel. This is a lightweight multi-crypto wallet that can be utilized on PCs and cell phones. It’s a nice pick for Cardano storage and instant trading. The simplicity of use and optimal performance make it a perfect fit. Guarda puts customers' security on a pedestal: it doesn't keep the client's information, private keys or exchange details. Codes don’t leave the client's gadget and are erased from the soft once you log out. No KYC procedure is required, so you don't need to make numerous confirmations. Supporting 300+ coins, it remains the most straightforward and simple suite to deal with crypto resources. The wallet enables overall control for clients to see how their tokens are distributed and sent and makes storage safe as never before. It is the safest, most simple, and decentralized ADA storage option you can ever envision. Solid encryption and smart private key storage make it exceptionally secure, so you should definitely pay attention to Atomic. Great news for ADA holders: as of December 2018,  Trezor Wallet  has introduced support of ADA in its T model. It’s perfect for keeping crypto away from hackers’ prying eyes. It functions as a USB drive on which information is accessed exclusively by the owner. The PIN code should be set up. On the chance that you lose it, there's a recovery seed for backing up the money. Wish to transfer other coins to this hardware depositary? No problem! Trezor is a multi-currency gadget. Besides that, the wallet is simple to use — its interface is clear and comprehensible for novice users. Simply plug it in to enjoy breezy navigation combined with great performance. The gimmick is lightweight — take it anywhere with you. Extra security is guaranteed thanks to the 24-word seed coupled by the passphrase: that makes getting to the wallet inconceivable for anybody except the proprietor! Caution: if you forget/lose the passphrase, you won't probably restore it. Are there any drawbacks? If you aren’t against paying up to $100 and connecting it to your PC, this device is impeccable. While Trezor isn't connected to a PC, it's turned off. This year, we will get the opportunity to create an ADA wallet in  Ledger Nano S : the company is intending to add ADA coin in 2019. Ledger Nano S is a rare gadget that works with hundreds of cryptocurrencies, so it’s not a surprise that ADA will join the row soon. Hardware storage of cryptocurrencies presupposes keeping your assets offline, which makes it the safest storage alternative accessible. It will keep private codes in a safe environment protected by a PIN code. It also provides two-factor validation code support and swap operations are confirmed using OLED screen by pushing the buttons. You can buy a safe Ledger wallet by using  this referral link . Why consider an exchange? There are many reasons for which it may be a good option: The truth is that Cardano has only one official wallet right now, so if you need a more flexible solution, be prepared to use web platforms. Currently, not so many exchanges support the storage of Cardano, so it's important to pick up a safe wallet that will ensure proper protection and security of your account and funds. Binance is developing at an astonishing rate, and if this keeps up, it will be one of the greatest crypto trade platforms according to exchanging volume. Also, Binance keeps registering fresh coins from new ICOs, which only contributes to the enormous trade volume. At the moment, it supports over 140 tokens, including ADA. Want to handle several cryptocurrencies and ensure high liquidity? Consider  Binance : you will enjoy optimal fees together with a fast transaction speed. Any other advantages? Although you have to trust your private codes to a third-party server, Binance ensures decent protection of your personal account: 2-factor verification prevents unauthorized access. It’s quite a controversial alternative for Cardano storage –  Coinbase  has a couple of drawbacks with regards to protection and security. For instance, it controls your private codes and tracks your cryptocurrency operations (theoretically, client accounts can be closed for unlawful transactions made with ADA). In any case, Coinbase guarantees brilliant performance and is ideal for purchasing and swapping crypto. With this site, you can work with a U.S. bank account and purchase Cardano in a few seconds. If you decide to sell Cardano, it will be converted into USD and sent to your account as well. It's a truly flexible platform. Another worry shared by clients is Coinbase's vulnerability to hacking. We have already witnessed tons of notorious hacker attacks, and Coinbase can easily become another target. That’s why storing a huge amount of ADA on an account would be a mistake. The creators of AdaLite chased the idea of making a comprehensible Cardano wallet that would be used easily by both novices and professionals. To utilize AdaLite, you don't have to deal with registrations and installations. Instead, you can proceed to the wallet at AdaLite.io right away. Once a new wallet is registered, the user has to create 12-word passphrase which serves as the key to his account. Losing this key means you will lose your all ADA reserves, so keep it very secure. AdaLite protects users’ keys from all third-party sources. It doesn’t store customers’ information and doesn’t keep backups. So if you take care of it yourself, this website is pretty secure. One more perk is integration with the Trezor Model T and Daedalus wallets: it provides the user with additional protection. Please, note that AdaLite cannot be used for Cardano Staking. Here are some practices to guarantee the safe and stress-free storage of crypto funds: Although there are not many native Cardano wallets, you can still choose one of the decent solutions — aside from Daedalus, a few other desktop options are available. Hardware wallets will add ADA soon, and in the meantime, you can store solid amounts of Cardano on a paper wallet. For active trading, consider online wallets: they provide flexibility and ease of access. With a safe and reliable Cardano wallet, you will sleep soundly knowing that your crypto assets and private keys are inaccessible for hackers. All of the above-reviewed wallets have been tested by time, so you can surely trust them with your crypto riches.",https://u.today/guides/crypto-wallets/the-best-cardano-wallets-2019,utoday,2019-05-29,12:18:00,en
cardano, News , Weiss Crypto Ratings Downgrades EOS Due to Centralization Concerns ,"United States-based  financial research firm Weiss Ratings announced that it has downgraded its rating of  cryptocurrency   EOS  because of the blockchain’s “serious problems” with centralization. Weiss announced the report in a tweet  published  on June 7. In the tweet, Weiss Ratings claims that the cryptocurrency in question has severe centralization issues and that “their event last week did anything to alleviate that,” evidently referring to an event  hosted  by EOS developer, Block.one on June 1. Weiss decided to lower EOS’ technology score, given the development. The tweet also hinted that fellow top crypto  ADA  is next in line to prove itself as a decentralized proof-of-stake ( PoS ) blockchain system: “It’s now up to #ADA to launch a truly decentralized # PoS  # blockchain . No pressure.” This is a drastic change in the company’s outlook towards EOS. As Cointelegraph  reported  in March, Weiss had previously put EOS beside bitcoin ( BTC ) and  XRP  and in its report on emerging trends in crypto markets. At the time, EOS received an A grade as the leading cryptocurrency that is challenging  Ethereum  in an attempt to become the “backbone of the new internet.” During its June 1 event, Block.one  announced  a blockchain-based  social media  platform called Voice, which allegedly will use the EOS blockchain to provide transparency on how it operates.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/weiss-crypto-ratings-downgrades-eos-due-to-centralization-concerns,cointelegraph,2019-06-08,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson Thinks Cardano Will Prevail Over Libra in Emerging Markets ,"Cardano  founder Charles Hoskinson claimed that emerging markets are where  cryptocurrencies  matter, and that  Facebook’s  announced virtual currency  Libra  is not going to find success in this area, according to a  report  by Finance Magnates on June 26. According to Hoskinson, emerging markets are the future. He says: “Emerging markets are where cryptocurrencies matter [...] When I look at the developed world, I don’t care. It’s highly regulated and, in many cases, a rigged system. If I decide to compete with a tech company they can just push me out via regulation. [...] Then I sit down with the prime minister of Georgia and he says, ‘we’re open for business.’ We can rebuild parts of their  education  infrastructure, create a new  payments  system or do a  medical  records system. The keys to the kingdom are right there. That’s 4 million people who in ten or twenty years will be very high-value users.” In contrast, Hoskinson predicted a struggle for Facebook in promoting Libra due to its lack of relationships, which he said need to be built over time, based on tangible benefits specific to the emerging markets in question. In his words: “Facebook has to come into countries it doesn’t know a lot about and convince them to enslave themselves to an economic monopoly and give nothing in return. And their only pitch is that you’ll pay less on fees. [...] I’m going there and saying, ‘we’re going to rebuild all your systems so you have  fraud -free land registration, better  voting  systems and improved  supply chains .’ We’re already doing this stuff but it took years. These are relationship-based markets – and Facebook doesn’t have those relationships.” Nonetheless, as previously  reported  by Cointelegraph, Facebook’s stated aim with Libra is: “Our ultimate goal is to help billions of people with access to things they don’t have now — that could be things like healthcare, equitable financial services, or new ways to save or share information.” Other major industry players like Coinbase have made promoted crypto’s potential benefits to citizens in developing countries. When the crypto exchange  added  support for 50 new jurisdictions in May, Coinbase made the following remark in its official  announcement : “For new customers in countries like Argentina and Uzbekistan, where consumer prices are expected to inflate by 10–20% in 2020, stablecoins like USDC could provide an opportunity to protect against inflation.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-thinks-cardano-will-prevail-over-libra-in-emerging-markets,cointelegraph,2019-06-28,00:00:00,en

cardano, Market Analysis ," Top-5 Crypto Performers: EOS,  LEO, ETC, ADA, XMR ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. There is a sea of red as most of the top 20 currencies are showing negative returns for the week. This shows that the market is in a bear grip. The total market capitalization has dipped from over $385 billion on June 27 to just over  $262  billion at press time. Though Bitcoin prices have also corrected in the past few days, the leading digital currency has managed to hold market dominance above 64%. This shows that market participants prefer Bitcoin over altcoins. Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin is likely to consolidate between $10,000 and $14,000. However, once institutional interest picks up, Bitcoin will move up to its  all-time-highs  before the end of this year. Let’s see if we spot any buy setups in the top five performers of the past seven days. EOS/USD Due to the uncertain regulatory environment, California-based crypto wallet service Abra has  restricted  American users from holding five cryptocurrencies, including  EOS , after August 29. EOSFinex, the EOS-based decentralized cryptocurrency exchange by Bitfinex, has completed its beta phase and is expected to  launch  on July 30.   The EOS/USD pair broke below $3.8723 in the week before but it quickly climbed back to close above the critical support. This shows buying at lower levels but demand dries up at higher levels, hence, the price has failed to bounce sharply from the support.  Currently, bulls are attempting to hold the support. If successful, the digital currency might try to rise back above the moving averages and rally towards the recent highs of $8.6503. Both moving averages have flattened out, which points to a consolidation in the next few weeks. However, contrary to our expectations, if the price plunges below $3.8723, it might descend to the next support at $1.55. If this support breaks, a new downtrend will start, which will be very negative. We suggest traders wait for the price to breakout and close (UTC time frame) above 20-week EMA before buying with a stop loss of $3.20.    LEO/USD Arrington XRP Capital and the Arca crypto investment fund have  acquired  a stake in Unus Sed Leo (LEO), the native token of Bitfinex, through offshore investment vehicles. This may lead to more trouble for Bitfinex, which is already under investigation for offering trading  services  to the residents of New York without a license. The company, however, denies doing so. Even with news not being very favorable, the price has turned out to be a winner in the past seven days. Can it build on its strength? Let’s analyze the chart. As the LEO/USD pair has a short trading history, we will use the daily chart to analyze it. The pair is consolidating between $1.20-$1.40. As the price is trading below both moving averages and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, the advantage is with the bears. If the digital currency breaks below $1.20, it may correct to the low at $1.0075. A breakdown to new lows will be a bearish sign. Conversely, if the price attempts a recovery, it will face resistance at 20-day EMA and above it at $1.40. A breakout of $1.40 will be the first indication that a short-term bottom might be in place. On the upside, the first target is the 50-day SMA, above which, a rally to $2 is probable. We suggest traders wait for the price to break out and sustain above $1.40 before attempting to buy it. ETC/USD Though Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) has declined over 4% in the past seven days, it has turned out to be the third-best performer among major cryptocurrencies. Can the price recover or will it fall further from current levels? Let’s find out. The ETC/USD pair is attempting to form a large base at the bottom. It has been trading inside a large range of $3.40-$10 since end-October last year. This is a positive sign because the longer the base, the stronger the eventual breakout from it will be. The price turned down from the overhead resistance of $10 after bulls failed to scale it for five weeks (enclosed in an ellipse on the chart). Currently, the price has dipped below both moving averages, which have flattened out. This shows that the price is likely to remain inside the range for the next few weeks. If it gradually drops down close to the support at $3.40 and bounces off it, we will suggest long positions as it will offer a low-risk buying opportunity. Our neutral view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $3.40. In such a case, the cryptocurrency will start a new downtrend.  ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) was the fourth-best performer of the past seven days even though it fell by over 4%. During the week, it rallied to become the tenth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Will it maintain its position or will it again fall out of the top ten? Let’s find out. The bears broke below the support of $0.0592761 in the week before but they could not sustain the lower levels. This shows buyers are keen to lap up the cryptocurrency on dips. However, bulls have not been able to push the price higher in the past seven days. This shows that buying dries up at higher levels. The ADA/USD pair has formed an inside day candlestick pattern, which shows confusion among buyers and sellers regarding the next direction. If the price plunges below $0.050, it may correct to $0.035 and if it cracks that barrier, a retest of the yearly lows is likely. On the other hand, if the price climbs above both moving averages, it is likely to reach the overhead resistance of $0.10. We believe traders should wait for the price to scale above 20-week EMA before establishing fresh positions. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) is attempting to make a place in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Do the technicals on the chart show any bullish setup? Let’s find out. The bulls are attempting to hold the XMR/USD pair above the support at $81. Though bulls purchased the dip to $71.842 in the week before, they have not been able to force a rebound. This shows a lack of demand at higher levels. Currently, the price is hovering around $81. If it fails to bounce from this level, the probability of a breakdown increases. The next support on the downside is at $60.  Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to 50, which points to a consolidation for the next few weeks. If the pair reverses direction from current levels and moves above $90.114, it will try to climb up to $120. However, we do not find any buy setups, hence, we remain neutral on it.  The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-eos-leo-etc-ada-xmr,cointelegraph,2019-07-28,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Announces Upcoming Release of v1.6 ,"Charles Hoskinson, a co-founder of the Ethereum Network and current CEO of IOHK, has announced that IOHK-created project Cardano is rolling out version 1.6 within a few days’ time. Hoskinson teased the upcoming launch in a Twitter  post  on Aug. 13. Hoskinson also asked users to send screenshots and comments on the latest version of Daedalus, which is an open source cryptocurrency wallet also backed by IOHK. As per IOHK’s website,  Cardano  is a blockchain platform that uses the proof of stake algorithm Ouroboros. Its native cryptocurrency, ADA, is based on the functional programming language Haskell.  Daedalus , for its part, is the only cryptocurrency wallet that supports ADA. Additionally, the website states that Daedalus can also be used as a wallet manager to organize and provide backup for other wallets and their assets. A new project for Hoskinson As previously  reported  by Cointelegraph, Hoskinson announced during the blockchain conference Consensus 2019 that he would be working on a new project with the security token platform Polymath. The project is called Polymesh, and is reportedly an attempt to create a blockchain for tokens centered on meeting regulatory requirements. In the  announcement , Hoskinson said: “After co-founding Ethereum and Cardano, two of the most widely used blockchains in the world, I am looking forward to working on Polymesh. There are quadrillions of dollars of financial securities, and building a blockchain to secure them is an incredibly exciting task.” Cynicism toward Facebook’s Libra Hoskinson has also  commented  in the past on how he believes Libra is not going to succeed in its global aims, particularly within emerging markets. In an interview late June, he commented: “Facebook has to come into countries it doesn’t know a lot about and convince them to enslave themselves to an economic monopoly and give nothing in return. And their only pitch is that you’ll pay less on fees. [...] I’m going there and saying, ‘we’re going to rebuild all your systems so you have fraud-free land registration, better voting systems and improved supply chains.’ We’re already doing this stuff but it took years. These are relationship-based markets – and Facebook doesn’t have those relationships.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/iohk-ceo-charles-hoskinson-announces-upcoming-release-of-cardano-v16,cointelegraph,2019-08-13,00:00:00,en

cardano, Market Analysis ," Top-5 Crypto Performers: ETC, IOTA, ADA, TRX, XLM ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. Facebook’s Libra continues to face resistance as central banks, regulators and governments have not been supportive of the project. Due to this, a few early backers of Libra are considering  withdrawing  from the project to avoid unwanted scrutiny of their existing businesses.   Bank of England Governor Mark Carney has said that a digital currency similar to Libra could  replace  the United States dollar as the reserve currency of the world, albeit through a network of central bank digital currencies, rather than a consortium of private companies — as is the case with Libra.  We do not find any sustained trend in most major cryptocurrencies, therefore, investors should reduce their position size until the uptrend resumes. Though short-term trades can be taken, long-term investors will have to be patient with their purchases. Can we spot any buying opportunities in the top five performers of the past week? Let’s find out. ETC/USD Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) was the best performer of the past seven days by a huge margin. A bulk of its  rally  can be attributed to the forthcoming Atlantis hard fork, scheduled for next month, which aims to address security concerns of the community. ETC Labs announced that London-based token investment group North Block Capital has joined its Studio program. Both entities will work together to create comprehensive token sale initiatives for North Block Capital investments, clients and partners. The companies will also endeavor to expand to Asian markets. After the sharp rally, can the momentum continue or will profit-booking drag prices down? Let’s analyze its chart.   After trading in a small range for the past five weeks, the ETC/USD pair made a decisive move this week. It has broken out of both moving averages, which is a positive sign. If bulls can sustain the momentum, a rally to $10 is probable. $10 is likely to act as a stiff resistance because the price had turned down from it on two previous occasions. A breakout of this resistance will start a new uptrend that can carry the price to $15 and above it to $20. Conversely, if the pair turns down from $10, it might extend its stay inside the wide range. The longer the consolidation, the stronger and more reliable will be the eventual breakout from it. Traders can buy on dips to $6.50 next week and keep a stop loss of $5. If the support at $5 breaks down, the pair can drop to the bottom of the range at $3.40.  IOTA/USD MIOTA ( IOTA ) was the second-best performer of the past seven days. EDAG  announced  that it will showcase its EDAG CityBot multifunctional robotic vehicle, which uses IOTA’s machine-to-machine payments. A new parking  app  developed by trive.me also utilizes IOTA’s Tangle. Is this a good time to buy? The IOTA/USD pair is trading inside a wide range of $0.244553 and $0.541. One of the reliable strategies to trade a range-bound market is to buy on a rebound from support and sell closer to resistance. The bears attempted to break below $0.244553 last week, but did not find sellers at lower levels. This week, the sharp bounce suggests that buyers are keen to defend the support. Therefore, traders can buy above $0.28 and keep a stop loss of $0.20. The first target objective is $0.38 and above it $0.541. If bulls fail to build on the bounce, bears will make another attempt to break below the yearly low of $0.207622. It this support cracks, the next target on the downside is $0.14. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) is attempting to make its way back into the top-10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Has it turned positive? Let’s analyze its chart. After failing to scale above the overhead resistance zone of $0.10–$0.11151 in late June, the ADA/USD pair has corrected close to the support at $0.035778. If this support breaks down, a retest of the yearly low at $0.0282710 is possible. With the price trading below both moving averages, the advantage is with he bears. Still, as the price is close to the support of the range, traders can attempt to buy on a strong bounce off $0.035778. The stop loss can be kept below the yearly low of $0.028. There is a minor resistance at $0.0580828 and above it at the moving averages. A breakout of moving averages can propel the price to $0.10.  Our bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the moving averages and plunges below the yearly low.  TRX/USD The number of Tron ( TRX ) DApps has continued to rise, reaching  561 , according to DAppReview. Both transaction time and transaction volume also increased by 30% over the previous week. Is the cryptocurrency ready for a reversal? Let’s find out. The failure of bulls to propel the TRX/USD pair above the overhead resistance of $0.04 in late June attracted sharp selling. Though the price has broken below the strong support at $0.01774, the bears have not been able to capitalize on the breakdown. This shows a lack of sellers at lower levels. The pair is currently finding support near $0.016. However, as long as the price remains below the downtrend line, there is a risk of a fall to the yearly low at $0.01124.  Conversely, a breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line on a weekly basis will be the first signal that buyers are back in action. The recovery will face resistance at the moving averages and above it at $0.03. As the rebound from the support is weak, we suggest traders wait for the price to break out and sustain above the downtrend line before attempting long positions. XLM/USD Stellar ( XLM ) rounded up the top five with a flat performance in the past seven days. Can it build on its gains or will it decline again? Let’s analyze its chart. The XLM/USD pair has been making new yearly lows in the past two weeks. This shows that the trend is down. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. However, the downtrend has not picked up momentum after breaking down of the strong support at $0.072545. This shows that investors do not want to part with their holdings at these levels. Nevertheless, the absence of a strong bounce indicates a lack of urgency among bulls to buy at the current levels. Though there might be a short-term bounce, investors should avoid it. We will wait for the price to sustain above $0.072545 for more than a week before proposing a trade in it.  Market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-etc-iota-ada-trx-xlm,cointelegraph,2019-08-25,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , New Balance to Use Cardano Blockchain to Confirm Product Authenticity ,"Cardano CEO Charles Hoskinson announced that New Balance will be using the Cardano blockchain to help authenticate its products. The announcement According to a Sept. 28  article  by Crypto Briefing, Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain engineering startup IOHK, announced that American footwear brand New Balance will use the Cardano blockchain to allow its customers to verify the origins of an range of products. Cardano and New Balance are planning to roll out the program globally. However, current plans do not entail using the  ADA  token during this pilot. Hoskinson reportedly made the partnership announcement during Cardano’s 2nd anniversary event at the Cardano Summit in Bulgaria’s second-largest city, Plovdiv. Blockchain, global supply chain and health insurance A wide range of companies have already started to implement blockchain technology into their supply chains. As Cointelegraph recently  reported , Walmart is using blockchain technology to create a food traceability system based on the Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger Fabric.  In August public enterprise blockchain platform VeChain  partnered  with Australian winemaker Penfolds to release a case of blockchain-encrypted wine bottles for sale, as part of its Wine Traceability Platform initiative. Cointelegraph  reported  in March that Carrefour introduced its own blockchain-powered solution for tracking milk, which is reported to guarantee clients complete product traceability across the entire supply chain — from farmers’ fields to the store shelves.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-balance-to-use-cardano-blockchain-to-confirm-product-authenticity,cointelegraph,2019-09-29,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Blockchain Firm Helps Congo Mine Fight Against Blood Diamonds ,"Berlin-based blockchain company RCS Global is delivering mine-to-market technology solutions to help fight against conflict minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Not part of a blood-stained supply chain On Oct.1, Reuters  reported  that government officials in the Societe Miniere de Bisunzu (SMB) mine in Congo are using blockchain technology to assure its clients that the minerals they purchase are not part of a blood-stained supply chain. RCS Global started implementing its blockchain technology solutions at the beginning of 2019 — enabling SMB mine officials to digitally tag their minerals. RCS managing director Ferdinand Maubrey said: “It allows purchasers of SMB material to be sure that it actually comes from that mine site and is not smuggled into the supply chain from other mines, as much as possible.” Today, mines rely mostly on a paper-based certification system, which is prone to corruption. Maubrey said that the new RCS Global system helped prevent tainted minerals from being mixed with SMB’s clean and traceable minerals by creating new obstacles, adding: “To use stolen tags, for example, a smuggler would also need to steal both the scanner and the laptop linked to it.” Despite the fact that this is one step in the right direction, SMB chief executive Ben Mwangachuchu pointed out that digital systems can still be corrupted “if the government agents who tag bags conspire with smugglers to enter incorrect data from the outset.” He added: “If they collude and say we are going to feed the information we want ... for our own benefit, you will never know.” New Balance uses blockchain to confirm product authenticity Cointelegraph previously  reported  that Charles Hoskinson, CEO of blockchain engineering startup IOHK, announced that American footwear brand New Balance will use the Cardano blockchain to allow its customers to verify the origins of a range of products.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-firm-helps-congo-mine-to-fight-against-blood-diamonds,cointelegraph,2019-10-02,00:00:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis ," Top-5 Crypto Performers: LINK, TRX, EOS, XRP, ADA ","Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee believes that Bitcoin does  well  when the S&P 500 market index moves up. Though Bitcoin might act as a macro hedge against global turmoil in some instances, it has largely performed negatively when the S&P 500 has dropped. It will be interesting to see how Bitcoin moves in the next few weeks. Bakkt’s launch did not generate the interest it was expected to do, which led some to blame it as the reason for the recent drop in Bitcoin. However, institutional traders do not jump in without testing waters. In a press release, Intercontinental Exchange stated that Bakkt completed its first  block  trade, executed between Galaxy Digital and XBTO on Oct. 1. Following the trade, XBTO said the platform “can accommodate large trades.” The  dominance  of Bitcoin continues to drop, which shows that the action is gradually shifting to altcoins. However, for the altcoins to continue their outperformance, Bitcoin has to either consolidate or move up gradually. In the event of a sharp drop in the leading cryptocurrency, a number of altcoins are likely to follow suit. Let’s analyze the charts of the top performers of the past seven days and try to spot any reliable buy setups. LINK/USD Chainlink ( Link ) is the top performer of the past seven days. It has risen about 25% during the period. This is the second consecutive week that the cryptocurrency has found a place among the top performers. Does it indicate a change in trend? Let’s analyze its chart. After consolidating between $1.50 and $2.0531 for the past five weeks, the bulls are attempting a breakout above this range. If the LINK/USD pair sustains above $2.0531, it will indicate strength. The next level to watch on the upside will be a move to $2.8498, above which the momentum is likely to pick up. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in the  previous  analysis. However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2.0531, the pair might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks. The pair will weaken on a break below $1.50. The next support to watch on the downside is $1.3139, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally.  TRX/USD In order to find loopholes in their security systems, companies offer  bug bounties  to hackers to find bugs and submit a vulnerability report. The Tron Foundation is the third-largest spender on such bug bounties trailing EOS and Coinbase.  Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has frozen 12 billion TRX and has voted itself as the  highest-ranked  “Super Representative” in the Tron ( TRX ) ecosystem. While a few have viewed this as a positive, others have objected to this buyout by the industry leader. Can the currency build on its recent pullback? Let’s study its chart. The TRX/USD pair declined close to the yearly low of $0.01124 the week before. This is a negative sign as it shows that bears continue to sell on minor rallies. If the current pullback fails to scale above the overhead resistance of $0.01774, we anticipate another attempt by the bears to sink the pair to new lows. However, if the cryptocurrency rises above the overhead resistance, it might face some resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is sloping down. If this resistance is crossed, a move to the 50-week SMA and above it to $0.0409111 is possible. We will wait for the price to scale and sustain above $0.01774 before proposing a trade in it. EOS/USD The United States Securities and Exchange Commission has  settled  charges against Block.one, the parent company behind EOS, with a penalty of $24 million, for conducting an unregistered initial coin offering. In a recent article, a security engineer has raised  concerns  that the  EOS  network can be congested using just a few dollar’s worth of EOS. However, Block.one has said that the network is operating “correctly.”  The EOS/USD pair is currently in a downtrend. The bears broke below the critical support of $3.1534 the week before, which shows continued selling pressure. However, the bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above $3.1534. If successful, a move to the downtrend line is possible.  This is a major resistance, above which, the pair can rally to $4.8719. The momentum is likely to pick up above this level. History suggests that the moving averages are unlikely to offer a stiff resistance. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line and keep a stop loss below $2.40. However, if the bulls fail to scale the price above $3.1534, the bears will try to resume the downtrend and retest the 52-week low at $1.55.  XRP/USD Ripple has  acquired  crypto trading firm Algrim which will give it an entry into Iceland, where the company wants to establish an engineering hub. In another announcement, Ripple’s investment arm Xpring has  partnered  with cryptocurrency payment processor BitPay, enabling businesses to accept XRP payments via BitPay’s cross-border payments platform. Separately, content creators with web monetization platform Coil can now receive  XRP  funds in real-time, following a  tie-up  between Coin and GateHub Ltd. Can these string of partnerships and acquisitions boost prices? Let’s analyze the chart. The XRP/USD pair has formed a descending triangle, which is a bearish setup. Though the price closed (UTC time) below the support at $0.24508, the bears have not been able to capitalize on the breakdown. This shows buying at lower levels. Currently, the bulls have again pushed the price back above $0.24508. However, the recovery will face resistance at both moving averages and above it at the downtrend line of the triangle. The pair will turn positive if it breaks out of the triangle. On the other hand, if the price turns down from one of the overhead resistances and plummets below $0.22, the downtrend will resume. We will wait for a new buy setup to form before proposing a trade in it.  ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) CEO Charles Hoskinson has announced that American footwear brand New Balance will use the Cardano blockchain to  authenticate  a range of its products. Though it has found a place among the top five performers, has the cryptocurrency bottomed out? Can it build on its gains in the next few weeks? Let’s find out. The ADA/USD pair plunged to the critical support of $0.035778 the week before. Though the bulls have managed to defend the support, they have not been able to achieve a strong rebound. This is a negative sign as it shows a lack of demand even at these levels. A shallow pullback is likely to encourage bears to again attempt to break below the support of $0.035778. If successful, a drop to the 52-week low of $0.02830 is possible. If this support also gives way, the pair will start a new downtrend. However, if the bulls manage to keep the price above $0.035778, a move to $0.0560221 is likely. We do not find any buy setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on the cryptocurrency.

cardano, News ," If Bitcoin Fails, Crypto Industry in for a Bad Time: Cardano Founder ","Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder turned Cardano ( ADA ) creator Charles Hoskinson believes that if Bitcoin ( BTC ) fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail. Hoskinson made his remarks during an interview for the Off the Chain  podcast  on Oct. 10, hosted by Morgan Creek Digital Assets co-founder Anthony Pompliano. After multiple projects that included co-founding Ethereum, Hoskinson — a mathematician, cryptographer and entrepreneur — founded the peer-to-peer technology firm Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) in 2015.  As CEO of IOHK, Hoskinson created and launched the cryptocurrency Cardano in 2017, which uses a Proof-of-Stake ( PoS ) algorithm dubbed Ouroboros. Bitcoin: “blind, deaf and dumb by design” During the interview, Hoskinson reflected on Bitcoin's origins, the parameters they set for subsequent projects, so-dubbed Bitcoin maximalism, and how Bitcoin’s future survival is intimately bound up with the fate of the entire industry. “One of the biggest problems with Bitcoin,” he began, “is that it’s blind, deaf and dumb and that was by design.”  This was appropriate for its earliest ambitions, he said, proposing that the two core features of the Bitcoin experiment were “will Proof-of-Work evolve into a decentralized system and will the token achieve value?” Conversely, Bitcoin was never intended “to replicate the world financial system and also be fully compliant with that system, this was not in its scope.” Hoskinson critiqued Bitcoin Maximalists for taking Satoshi’s vision as “the gospel” and dismissing any deviation from it as wrong:  “I can’t even make pull payments with Bitcoin and that’s [...] the bread and butter of most of our commercial systems.” Maximalists should concede that Bitcoin’s not necessarily always fit-for-purpose, he said. And having to go off-chain to solve certain limitations isn’t the solution either: “You don’t solve your decentralized reality, your decentralized dream, by centralizing it. That’s philosophically incompatible.” “Bitcoin, frankly, is the brand of cryptocurrencies” Hoskinson's comments on Bitcoin’s importance for the entire cryptocurrency space spun out of a discussion of the merits of Proof-of-Work ( PoW ) vs. Proof-of-Stake systems, and which of the two is more likely to survive.  He made the case that PoW systems will only survive if they find a way to evolve in such a way that the work — computation — becomes useful, i.e. by monetizing excess computational capacity in order to establish a “marketplace for distributed computation.” Currently, he argued, those who are evangelical about the need to preserve an absolutely trustless protocol ignore the fact that PoW systems always federate in reality, being determined by who has access to subsidized power, data centers and specialized ASIC miners.  Notwithstanding his vision of how the PoW space needs to evolve in order to overcome these shortcomings, he concluded with the robust acknowledgment that: “Bitcoin frankly is the brand of cryptocurrencies. We can’t say, oh, I’m going to succeed but Bitcoin’ll fail. if Bitcoin fails, the whole industry’s probably in for a really bad time.” As reported by Cointelegraph, Hoskinson had  announced  the roll-out of Cardano version 1.6 this August.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/if-bitcoin-fails-crypto-industry-in-for-a-bad-time-cardano-founder,cointelegraph,2019-10-11,00:00:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis , Altcoins Prepare to Rally in the Shadow of Bitcoin’s Recent 42% Gain ,"Last week Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price action surprised the majority of the market and traders are now looking closely at altcoins to spot similarities that might signal a new altcoin market cycle.  Daily crypto market data. Source:  Coin360 As Bitcoin  surged , China-based altcoins began to break out of their downtrend and showed some significant increases. For example, altcoins like  NEO  rallied 101% and Ontology ( ONT ) quickly gained 128%. Let’s have a look at the altcoin market for an overview.  Altcoin market capitalization breaks the downtrend Total Altcoin Market Capitalization. Source: TradingView The total altcoin market capitalization broke out of a 4-month long downtrend and falling wedge structure. The market capitalization also provided a double bottom pattern at the $60 billion level and it managed to keep this support. Following the double bottom structure, a break to the upside occurred.  Similar signals were given before the last small ‘altcoin cycle’, beginning in February/March this year. During that period, a downtrend was broken through the similar construction of a falling wedge which resulted in a multi-month upwards cycle for altcoins.  Given the recent breakout to the upside, a conclusion can be drawn that a new higher low was made in the market. this means the market is moving in an uptrend since the low in December 2018. If the altcoin market capitalization can hold the $66-60 billion range and consolidate here, a new wave to the upside with a target at $125 billion can be expected. Bitcoin dominance shows strength Bitcoin Dominance chart. Source: TradingView Different signals are being shown from the Bitcoin dominance chart. The dominance chart made a strong bounce from the trendline, which started in April 2019 as Bitcoin started its upward trek to the temporary top at $13,900. Still, the bearish divergences are there since the local top, which could state that the dominance won’t be making new highs. As discussed previously, divergences generally mark a potential top and bottom formation. Below, the red rectangles show the previous examples can be found from these formations and every altcoin cycle has been marked through these.  What would be interesting to see for altcoins would be whether the dominance chart is able to break the uptrend to the downside. If that happens, altcoins are likely to benefit from that movement. Altcoin Dominance chart. Source: Cointrader.pro Surprisingly enough, the altcoin dominance chart is still holding on to the trendline. The most recent movements show similarities with the movements at the beginning of 2016 and 2017, through which a retest like this occurred as well. After this, altcoins started to rally. Ether finds crucial support at $160 ETH USD daily chart. Source: TradingView As Ether ( ETH ) is the biggest altcoin, the chart is showing a pattern that is identical to the movements of the total altcoin market capitalization. Ether can also be described as a leading indicator of future movements of altcoins.  The altcoin made a double bottom pattern at the $155-160 support area, within a falling wedge structure. This double bottom pattern led to a high volume bounce, after which the price continued to range around $185. This is a crucial level, as we can see in the history of the chart. During the first part of 2019, this price level remained a strong resistance prior to the breakout in April. Finding support on this level again gives strength to the market.  This is because Ether is making another higher low as the lowest level is $80 from December 2018, which is an essential part of an upward trending market. Over the coming weeks and months, it will be crucial to see some continuation to the upside for more confirmation. However, it’s unlikely to expect a drop below the $155 area after the current bounce upwards. Ether/ BTC pairing stuck in a downtrend ETH BTC daily chart. Source: TradingView Clearly, the downtrend is still active and valid on the Ether/BTC pair and this didn’t break out of the downtrend. A major mark for the altcoin market would be to see Ether breakout of this pattern, as it has been a downtrend for almost a year.  ETH BTC 3-day chart. Source: TradingView As shown by the 3-day chart, some similarities can be seen with the fractal from the start of 2017. During that period, Ether formed a bottom with bullish divergences prior to the big movement upwards.  Right now, this pair provides similar bullish divergences on the higher timeframes, marking a potential bottom and ranging around the downtrend. A major signal to the altcoin market would be given if Ether successfully broke out of this downtrend and generated significant volume alongside that breakout. Asian altcoins lead the way Last week President Xi Jinping  called  for China to support the development and adoption of blockchain and a serious breakout from the majority of Chinese altcoins took place. As mentioned earlier, some gained more than 100% in less than 24-hours. NEO is a perfect example. NEO USD daily Chart. Source: TradingView NEO made a falling wedge pattern with a double bottom structure (similar to Ether) at the exact same level as the area in January 2019. A full retrace was made from the first cycle to confirm support. This led to a big breakout a few days ago and a move of more than 100%. If NEO is able to hold the $9.50 - $10 area as support, continuation can be expected. However, a serious question must be asked. Are altcoins ready to follow the China-based coins or is it only particularly the Chinese market that is making these movements? From a technical perspective, multiple altcoins show signals of potential bottoming and are eager to show some movements. Another example is Cardano ( ADA ).  ADA USD 2-day Chart. Source: TradingView  Cardano broke out of the same structure as many altcoins, however, it still lags behind the Chinese altcoins. Currently, the signals are similar to the signals provided earlier this year and the price is hovering around the same areas as back then.  If Cardano is able to hold above $0.04 for support and clear the $0.045 resistance zone, continuation to the upside can be expected.  Given that the majority of altcoins show the same chart and generally move together, further movements of other altcoins can be expected.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Is ""Vastly Superior"" to EOS: Weiss Crypto Ratings","Weiss Ratings, the only reputable financial rating agency that does crypto rankings, has seemingly found a new darling -- Cardano (ADA).  Charles Hoskinson's brainchild  is now deemed to be ""vastly superior"" to EOS after finishing the first snapshot and balance check for Shelley.   #Cardano  is clearly superior to  #EOS . EOS was first to market, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that of the two, Cardano is vastly superior. More details on this in subsequent tweets.  #ADA   #crypto   #cryptocurrency card Back in June, Weiss Ratings has downgraded the score of EOS due to centralization concerns. The agency claimed that it was up to Cardano to come up with a truly decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) network.     This represents a major shift in the company's outlook towards on EOS. The token behind that underpins the ambitious idea of a decentralized world's computer was named the best digital asset by Weiss back in March, which made the coin  surge by more than 11 percent .          EOS takes a lot of heat because of its  controversial governance model . The project was caught in a major scandal in September 2018 after an internal document from Huobi, one of the block producers (BPs), shed light on  ""mutual voting""  that was meant to keep control over the network. Block.one, the developer of the EOS.IO blockchain, addressed this issue by claiming that they would  ensure a democratic election process . Recently, Block.one decided to  make its voice heard  by announcing its decision to participate in the block producer voting, which was seen as a step closer to centralization by the community.          In the meantime, EOS continues to reign supreme in China. As reported by U.Today, EOS  retained its first spot  in the freshly published rating by the Chinese CCID Research Institute. ",https://u.today/cardano-ada-is-vastly-superior-to-eos-weiss-crypto-ratings,utoday,2019-11-14,07:40:00,en
cardano, News ," ‘Crypto is Unstoppable’ — Bitcoin Will Hit $100K, Says Cardano Founder ","Ethereum ( ETH ) co-founder turned Cardano ( ADA ) creator Charles Hoskinson said that he expects Bitcoin ( BTC ) to be back over $10,000 and reach $100,000 in the future. In a tweet  published  on Nov. 22, Hoskinson urged the cryptocurrency community that Bitcoin is more than speculation, putting the blame on the latest drop in price on news media “FUD” — or fear, uncertainty and doubt — and market manipulation.  A global movement Because there’s more to Bitcoin than just price movements, he expects the world’s biggest cryptocurrency to see more gains in the future. He said: “Bitcoin's price is going down? Remember everyone, after the FUD, news trading and manipulation clears out, we still have a global movement that's going to change the world. We will see 10k btc again and welcome 100k. Crypto is unstoppable. Crypto is the future.” Bitcoin’s recent price action As Cointelegraph  reported , Bitcoin and altcoins have seen a notable price decrease yesterday. More precisely, Bitcoin briefly dipped below $7,000 before settling slightly higher. Still, as Cointelegraph’s market analysis  pointed out , Bitcoin dominance is up for the week at 69%, meaning that BTC has once again outperformed other cryptocurrencies during the despite its decline this week. Shortly after the price drop, Bitcoin futures daily volumes on digital asset platform Bakkt have  hit  a new all-time high, showing an increased interest in capitalizing on the renewed volatility. In October, Hoskinson also  expressed the idea  that if Bitcoin fails, the entire cryptocurrency industry could fail.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-is-unstoppable-bitcoin-will-hit-100k-says-cardano-founder,cointelegraph,2019-11-23,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano’s Payment Gateway for Merchants Is Now Live ,"The Cardano Foundation, the firm behind the  12th  biggest cryptocurrency Cardano ( ADA ), has launched AdaPay, an ADA payment gateway for merchants. Developed by the Cardano Foundation and enterprise-grade fintech platform Coti, the solution allows merchants to accept ADA payments with “near-instant” settlement in 35 fiat currencies directly in their bank accounts, the firm  announced  Nov. 27. The payment gateway was first announced in October 2019 The Cardano Foundation and Coti first  announced  their plans for the ADA payment gateway on Oct. 23. The payment solution is now purportedly available to be integrated directly into merchant’s website, using either an AdaPay button or a QR-based point of sale system, according to the announcement. Intending to enable merchants to manage real-time transactions in ADA, the solution uses Coti’s  Universal Payment Solution  (UPS) to further extend the utility case for the token. The payment tool is expected to combine “all existing support systems of traditional payment processors with the added value of digital assets,” as previously  announced . Following the news, ADA is up around 0.2% over the past 24 hours,  trading  at $0.039 at the time of this writing. ADA seven-day price chart.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top-5 Cryptos This Week: ATOM, TRX, ADA, EOS, XMR ","This is the second year in a row that November has turned out to be the worst month for Bitcoin ( BTC ) of the year. In 2018, Bitcoin’s price had plunged 36.18%. While this year, the decline has been 17.51%. However, December is an important month to watch out for. Since 2015, Bitcoin has moved more than  30%  in December. If history were to repeat itself, traders should buckle up for some violent moves in this month. At least five Chinese cryptocurrency exchanges have  halted  or terminated operations in November. This is the latest crackdown on crypto trading in China since it banned users from buying cryptocurrencies with fiat money back in September 2017. According to data from Chainalysis, the Asia-Pacific region, dominated by China, still has about 20 of the 50 top global crypto exchanges. These exchanges accounted for about 40% of Bitcoin transactions in the first half of the year. Hence, the crypto markets react sharply to any major announcement coming out of  China . Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 While the rise and fall of cryptocurrencies will continue to hog the limelight, we should also keep an eye on the benefits of blockchain technology for society. A study by Juniper Research shows that the food industry will benefit immensely by using blockchain in conjunction with Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and trackers. This move can result in food fraud savings of up to  $31 billion  within the next five years. Can the crypto markets stage a recovery in the final month of the year? What do the charts of the top performers of the past seven days project? Let’s find out. ATOM/USD Cosmos ( ATOM ) has seen huge gains in the past seven days with a 19% rally. During the week, the community  approved  the Cosmos hub 3 upgrade, which is likely to take place on  Dec. 11 . Can the altcoin continue its rally in the next few days or will it face profit booking? Let’s analyze its chart. ATOM/USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The ATOM/USD pair is stuck in a $4.4389 to $1.9101 range. The bulls failed to propel the price above the range a couple of weeks back. However, the subsequent dip below $3 was purchased aggressively that has propelled the price back towards the resistance. This is a positive sign as it shows strong demand at lower levels. We anticipate the buyers to make one more attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance. If successful, the pair might pick up momentum and rally to $7, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $4.4389 with a stop loss of $2.60. However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $4.4389, the price might extend its stay inside the range for a few more weeks. The first support on the downside is $2.6218 and below it $1.9101. TRX/USD Cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex  acquired  TRX Market, the largest non-custodial exchange on the Tron ( TRX ) network, for an undisclosed amount. Following the buyout, Poloniex has renamed TRX Market as “Poloni DEX” and has changed the website to poloniex.org. TRX/USDT weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The TRX/USD pair is stuck in a large range between $0.041 on the upside and $0.011240 on the downside. Currently, the price is attempting to bounce off the minor support close to $0.013 levels. A strong rebound can carry the price to $0.02340, which is likely to attract sellers. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the pair will consolidate between $0.013 and $0.02340, whereas, a breakout of $0.02340 can propel the price to $0.0410 Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below $0.013, a retest of $0.011240 will be on the cards. The 20-week EMA is sloping down gradually and the RSI is still in the negative territory, which suggests that bears are in command. We do not find any reliable buy setups, hence, we remain neutral on the pair. ADA/USD The Cardano ( ADA ) Foundation and fintech platform Coti, have developed AdaPay, an ADA  payment  gateway for merchants, which offers “near-instant” settlement in 35 fiat currencies directly in their bank accounts. Will this move boost prices in the coming weeks? Let’s study its chart. ADA/USDT weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The bulls have been attempting to defend the support at $0.035778 for the past two weeks. However, with the 20-week EMA sloping down and the RSI in the negative territory, the advantage is with the bears. If the rebound fails to scale above the 20-week EMA, the bears will attempt to sink the price below $0.035778. If successful, a retest of $0.028271 will be on the cards. Below this level, the downtrend will resume. The first sign of strength will be a move above the 20-week EMA. Such a move will indicate accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. The ADA/USD pair will pick up momentum on a break above the $0.0560221 to $0.065229 resistance zone. EOS/USD Six of  EOS ’s total pool of Block Producers are being managed by a  single  entity, according to EOS Block Producer EOS New York. This again raked up the issue of centralization in the EOS community. However, the altcoin shrugged aside the news and managed to rally about 8% in the past seven days. Can it extend its rally? EOS/USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The EOS/USD pair is bouncing off the critical support at $2.4001. This is a positive sign as it shows that buyers are keen to accumulate at lower levels. The price can now move up to the downtrend line. We anticipate stiff resistance at the downtrend line because three previous relief rallies had been rejected there. If the price again reverses direction from the downtrend line, the bears will attempt to sink it below $2.4001. If successful, a retest of $1.55 is likely. Alternatively, if the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, a move to $4.8719 is can occur. The pair will pick up momentum on a break above this level. XMR/USD A few crypto exchanges are delisting privacy-centric coins to appease regulators. Cryptocurrency exchange BitBay, for example, will  delist  Monero ( XMR ) on Feb. 19 next year. Security firm Eset has reported that cybercriminals have been using YouTube channels to  distribute  a Monero cryptocurrency mining module. However, after Eset informed YouTube, the channels were removed. Business technology publication ZDNet has  reported  that hackers have launched a new cryptojacking campaign to target vulnerable Docker instances to deploy crypto-malware to mine Monero. Even though the news flow has not been supportive, the altcoin has turned out to be the fifth-best performer of the past seven days. Do the technicals project a further rally? Let’s find out. XMR/USDT weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The XMR/USD pair has been trading inside a descending channel for the past few months. A breakout of the channel and the moving averages will be the first sign that the downtrend might be over. If the price closes (UTC time) above the moving averages, we anticipate a move to $121.427. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above the moving averages with a stop below $38. However, if the price fails to sustain above the channel, the bears will attempt to sink the pair below the critical support at $38.83. This is an important level to watch out for because if it cracks, the downtrend will resume.

cardano,No Section,"EOS Downgraded by Weiss Crypto Ratings Again, Here’s Why","The highly reputed agency  Weiss Ratings  downgrades the EOS project from B to C and spreads the word about it on its official Twitter page. The post promises a full article to come out soon and so far just explains the reasons for this decision. 1/6 We’ve had great respect for work and thinking that went into the  #EOS  project. But the Weiss Crypto Ratings model is not based on opinion. It’s driven by data. And that data has now caused a downgrade from B to C-. Here's why (full article to be published soon): Earlier this year, in June, U.Today reported that Weiss Ratings brought down the score of EOS. Back then, the reason was ‘a serious problem with centralization’ as the agency said in the tweet. The agency made it clear that they were expecting Cardano to take the place of EOS as a fully decentralized DLT project. EOS DOWNGRADE:  #EOS  has serious problems with centralization, and their event last week did anything to alleviate that, so we’ve severely downgraded its technology score. It’s now up to  #ADA  to launch a truly decentralized  #PoS   #blockchain . No pressure. #crypto   #Cardano   #BTC Before the score of EOS had beeb brought down first time, EOS stood above both Bitcoin and Ethereum on the Weiss Ratings scale. This time, Weiss Ratings is downgrading the technological score of EOS for yet the same reason – lack of decentralization. The tweet says that the main problem is that 68 percent of the voting power on EOS belongs to just 0.01 percent of the token holders (100 of them, to be exact). The agency urges the community to realize that the behemoths of the crypto world – Bitcoin and Ethereum – should not be considered technologically inferior. 2/6 Failure to decentralize - The top 100  #EOS  token holders, representing a meager 0.01% of the total, control a whopping 68% of the voting power. So much for the claim that EOS is a major improvement over older cryptos like  #Bitcoin  ( #BTC ) and  #Ethereum  ( #ETH ). In the middle of November, on Twitter Weiss Ratings went on with  praising the Cardano chain over EOS , saying that the former is ‘vastly superior’ to the latter. #Cardano  is clearly superior to  #EOS . EOS was first to market, but it’s becoming increasingly clear that of the two, Cardano is vastly superior. More details on this in subsequent tweets.  #ADA   #crypto   #cryptocurrency However, EOS remains coin number one in Chinese ratings. As reported by U.Today, since early November the EOS network has been  facing severe congestion difficulties  due to the EIDOS app. And its airdrop through the network. At present, users need to have a minimum of 100 EOS staked to perform transactions on this blockchain.",https://u.today/eos-downgraded-by-weiss-crypto-ratings-again-heres-why,utoday,2019-12-07,09:44:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano’s Shelley Testnet Starts Off With More Than 5 Billion Staked ADA ,"Within 24 hours of Cardano’s testnet going live, Cardano ( ADA ) holders have  staked  more than 5 billion ADA coins, worth around $195 million. On Dec. 15, IOHK took to Twitter to  report  that more than 240 staking pools have gone online since Shelley went live, with about 120 staking pools during the first day of operation alone. According to Shelley’s  roadmap , IOHK is well on its way to reaching its target of 1,000 staking pools. They tweeted: “Our incredible #CardanoCommunity have put in a remarkable effort this weekend, with over 240 pools (+ counting) getting ready for staking.” ADA holders have been waiting expectantly for the launch of Cardano’s Shelley incentivized testnet, in which participating users will be able to earn real ADA rewards, which they will reportedly receive by the end of the testnet period. The IOHK team also offers Shelly testnet participants a  rewards  calculator, which lets them calculate the estimated amount they can earn from staking ADA tokens. For example, users who stake 100,000 ADA, worth roughly $3,600 at writing time, could earn around $260 per year in staking rewards. Shelley mainnet will reportedly go live in early 2020, from which point staking will become available to all users. For reference, staking is the process of locking funds in a crypto wallet to support the operations of a blockchain network, which in turn earns the participant rewards. Cardano’s merchant payment gateway went live At the end of November, the Cardano Foundation  launched  AdaPay, an ADA payment gateway for merchants.

With the most recent wallet launch, ADA holders are now able to earn rewards by delegating their tokens or acting as a stake pool operator (the latter is  much more profitable ). These rewards will become spendable after the completion of the testnet.    By implementing such an incentive mechanism, Cardano moves towards decentralizing the network, which appears to be the main purpose of the Shelley era. As of Dec. 15, there were more than 240 pools available for staking. Cardano wants their number to grow to at least 1,000 in order to reach the required level of decentralization. That said, Cardano has already  greatly surpassed Tron and EOS , the main delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) networks, by the number of staking pools.   ",https://u.today/cardano-debuts-daedalus-rewards-wallet-for-staking-ada,utoday,2019-12-17,05:59:00,en

cardano, News , Cardano Co-Founder and CEO: We Anticipate a Hard Fork in Mid-February ,"Charles Hoskinson , co-founder and CEO of IOHK, the blockchain firm behind Cardano ( ADA ), said that he expects the coin to see a hard fork in mid-February. During a  livestream  on Jan. 17, Hoskinson noted that he expects Cardano’s consensus algorithm to be upgraded with a hard fork next month. He said that he has “pretty high certainty” that the Ouroboros Bizantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Protocol ( OBFT ) will be implemented in mid-February: “Looks like February — at pretty high certainty —  we’re going to have the OBFT hard fork occur. We’re still talking to our exchange partners about that and we just want to make sure all the infrastructure is lined up for it, but infrastructure looks pretty good, so mid-February we anticipate an OBFT hard fork.” As of press time, IOHK had not answered Cointelegraph’s inquiry concerning the changes brought on by the upgrade. This article will be updated pending that response. Hoskinson also said during the livestream that Ledger hardware wallet integration with Daedalus Cardano wallet software is nearly ready for deployment. Cardano sees rapid development This is not the only recent development for Cardano. As Cointelegraph  reported  earlier today, Cardano’s commercial blockchain arm Emurgo partnered with the government of Uzbekistan to form a blockchain task force to develop regulations for security token offerings and exchanges.

cardano, News , Cardano’s Commercial Arm to Help Uzbekistan Form Blockchain Task Force ,"The  Cardano  blockchain’s commercial arm, Emurgo, has partnered with the  government  of Uzbekistan to form a blockchain task force to develop regulations for security token offerings (STOs) and exchanges (STXs). In a Jan. 20  press release , Emurgo revealed its new cooperation with the Uzbek government and Kobea Group &  Infinity Blockchain Holdings — the official Technology Advisory Agency for Uzbekisitan’s Digital Economic Development Project — aimed at the development of a legal framework for STOs and STXs in Uzbekistan. As part of the initiative, Emurgo and Kobea will provide advisory services regarding infrastructure for digital asset banking, blockchain education units and other issues. Tokenization of traditional equities Emurgo will also examine the potential for Cardano’s third-generation blockchain in the country and will also integrate its blockchain education platform into Uzbekistan’s national universities to train future blockchain experts. By tokenizing traditional equities through STOs, the country purportedly intends to make the financial sector more transparent and secure. The initiative comes right after Uzbekistan’s National Agency for Project Management  prioritized  the creation of a national cryptocurrency mining pool in a bid to consolidate the capacities of domestic and foreign miners at the national level. With the move, the agency intends to ensure the economic efficiency of crypto mining, boost the transparency and security of the industry, increase the efficiency of energy consumption in this area and attract investment. Unclear stance toward cryptocurrencies Still, the government of Uzbekistan has demonstrated a mixed stance toward the usage of cryptocurrencies, as it  barred  its citizens from purchasing crypto in late December of last year. The decision came as a surprise to many, as the country had previously displayed a relatively lenient stance toward digital currencies. In September 2018, the country’s government  signed  a memorandum of understanding to regulate and establish licensing for crypto exchanges, mining operations and initial coin offerings.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardanos-commercial-arm-to-help-uzbekistan-form-blockchain-task-force,cointelegraph,2020-01-20,00:00:00,en
cardano, Recap ," Davos 2020: Awaited Regulations, Unexpected Enthusiasm, New Challenges ","Last week saw a whole host of world leaders — including United States President Donald Trump and Prince Charles of Wales, along with a number of other prominent dignitaries — come together to attend the 2020 iteration of the World Economic Forum that was held in Davos, Switzerland Jan. 20–24. As part of the five-day event, the  WEF  announced its decision to  establish  a global consortium for governing digital currencies — including stablecoins. Following the news, the  price of Bitcoin  proceeded to swiftly rise from around the $8,200 mark to $8,455 within an hour’s time. The consortium will consist primarily of various traditional financial institutions, global government agencies, economists, academics, as well as members of the forum’s different communities. In regard to what the consortium’s core goals are, a  report  released by the WEF states that in order for digital assets to become a part of the mainstream financial ecosystem, they have to be governed using an innovative regulatory structure that is transparent, inclusive and interoperable in nature. Thus, the body will seek to create such a framework as soon as possible with the help of the public and private sectors. Lastly, in comparison to  WEF 2019 , where the crypto industry at large was at the receiving end of a lot of flak — with people like  PayPal  CEO Dan Shulman and  JPMorgan Chase  CEO Jamie Dimon bashing digital currencies for their perceived nonutility — this year’s event has seen a marked difference in how a number of high-profile individuals and companies have begun to view cryptocurrencies and its underlying technology — i.e., blockchain. For example, according to KPMG’s U.S. blockchain lead, Arun Ghosh, the accounting giant will be  making use  of blockchain (in conjunction with  IoT  technology) this year to help solve many climate change-related issues. Experts remain divided on recent crypto-related developments Even though the WEF appears to have become increasingly more inclusive in its approach toward the crypto sector on paper, a number of experts believe that despite emerging technologies such as blockchain and artificial intelligence finally getting the recognition they deserve, most of the talk surrounding crypto in Davos has been about nation-states and central banks issuing their own digital currencies — an idea that a lot of people believe is self-defeating. For example, in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Riccardo Spagni, a major contributor to Monero’s core development, was quoted as saying: “They’re talking about how it's going to be inclusionary, but at the end of the day, they still want to police it. They still want to regulate it. So, it's not really inclusionary. It's inclusionary within the same framework that they've always had. So, that's a little bit disappointing because you can sense that it's still like the same room full of old school bankers, old school regulators. They are reluctant to change.” He further added that with the global crypto community starting to become more and more unified in its cause to help spread awareness regarding this burgeoning space, the financial elite of the world are being given a clear message that “if they don't adapt, if they don't change, they're going to end up losing.” However, on a more optimistic yet cautious note, Mark Esposito, a professor at Harvard University and the Thunderbird School of Global Management, told Cointelegraph he is hopeful that with more and more people beginning to understand the potential of crypto tech, it seems as though the global finance industry is on the threshold of a new beginning: “You see all these senior people that don't need to talk about crypto the way they are now. So, it looks like 2020 is going to be the tipping point of a major transformation. We are waiting for a new narrative to happen, and fintech is part of the new narrative.” Top crypto-related news to come out of Davos last week In addition to the forum establishing a consortium for governing digital assets, it also  released a framework  designed to help central banks create their very own state-backed cryptocurrencies, or CBDCs. According to an official  press release , this latest “CBDC Policy-Maker Toolkit” has been devised in conjunction with a number of central banking institutions, economists and international organizations. In this regard, it bears mentioning that the Bank of Thailand and the Central Bank of Bahrain are already making use of this toolkit. News of the aforementioned release was met with a lot of market hype, with value investor Bill Miller and Boston University professor Mark Williams stating that this announcement signifies a change in how the world’s economic elite now consider crypto and blockchain technology. Also, as part of the Davos 2020 forum, Singapore-based crypto exchange Huobi  announced  the launch of its new crypto brokerage platform that is designed primarily to lure institutional investors into this ever-evolving market. What makes the platform unique is that it offers its users zero transaction fees while making use of the “Smart Order Routing” model — which basically allows investors to get the best deals on their purchases. In relation to his company’s latest move, Huobi Group’s vice president for global business, Ciara Sun, said: “Institutional investors and HNWIs will be the major contributors of growth for the crypto economy in 2020 and beyond, but barriers like low liquidity and a lack of asset enhancement products are stalling widespread adoption.”  Lastly, a spokesperson for  Bakkt , a crypto futures trading platform run by the Intercontinental Exchange, announced the release of an all-new consumer app that is designed to support digital assets — including a wide range of cryptocurrencies. With that being said, Bakkt’s president, Adam White, did say that the app will look more like a traditional finance product rather than a crypto fintech one. Comparing previous WEFs in regard to crypto On the subject of how this year’s blockchain agenda in Davos compared to ones from previous years, Daniel Haudenschild, the president of the Crypto Valley Association, told Cointelegraph: “I think the level of discussions is healthy. I think what's happened is that the content has completely changed. I think anybody still walking around talking about crypto in blockchain now have something to hold on to. There's something serious behind their intention. There's no more fluff now because we've been through the Valley of Tears and many projects are coming to fruition. It's exciting. It's much more real. It’s almost like 2017 but without the hype.” He further added that 2020 seems primed to be the year of infrastructure development, especially because the market is seeing the entry of better players, institutional investors, and wealth and asset management companies — which is being driven primarily by negative interest rates. Haudenschild also pointed out: “We are observing a flush of new ASIC classes, tokenized securities, tokenized commodities, digital commodities as well as a rush of people trying to get the infrastructure in place — you know, the custody solutions, the wallets in order to be able to provide those services both on the banking side, but also on the trading end.” In Davos Cointelegraph also met music producer and innovative entrepreneur Alexander Shulgin, whose ideas regarding crypto mining have gained a lot of traction in recent years. When asked to expound on the subject, Shulgin told Cointelegraph: “Decentralized servers in regard to mining can help usher in a bright future for IoT-based technologies, smart cities and for so-called AI because, without computer processing, you cannot do any data mining.”  He further added that this WEF, a lot of conservative businessmen and big companies were taking the time to understand the implications of the forthcoming industry revolution and how it will make local mining easier (by reducing the overall computing requirements) for everyone interested in the business. Crypto Valley Week, TechPark and other side-events draw massive crowds In addition to all of the activities taking place as part of the WEF’s core agenda this past week, many other satellite events were also in full swing at the same time — with perhaps the largest of these being the  Crypto Valley Week . On Jan. 2, M&A PR Studio hosted the Blockchain Pitching Session, bringing together promising blockchain projects and investors at Davos 2020. An expert panel of judges chose to highlight three startups after difficult deliberations: Wom Protocol, Alethea AI and Bidali. CV Summit on Jan. 23 featured public addresses by a number of high-profile crypto personnel including MakerDAO’s Rune Christensen, ex-Cambridge Analytica’s Britanny Kaiser and Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson, among others. The topics of discussion ranged from how mainstream finance players can benefit from tokenization to how different countries administer their local crypto markets and beyond. To get a clearer picture of how much attention the crypto sector has been receiving from people all over the world this past year, Cointelegraph sat down with  Cardano’s  Hoskinson, who was in attendance at the CV Summit. In his view, Davos presents individuals with tremendous networking opportunities, citing his recent dinner meeting with Guns and Roses drummer Steven Adler as a perfect example of this. He then proceeded to add: “It's no longer just a bunch of nerds sitting around talking about code. We're really talking about solving real-life problems. And generally, the problems are always the same, which is this middleman of necessity that sucks value out of commercial connections between the edges. You have the AirBnbs, the Ubers, the Googles and other platforms like Facebook, where their product is their customer. And basically, they get so powerful that they get to sculpt an entire marketplace.” Lastly, the week also saw another important conference,  TechPark , draw in many famous innovators from all over the world, who discussed artificial intelligence, education technologies, blockchain, Big Data, the Internet of Things, and virtual and augmented reality, among others. Some of the speakers at the event included Jorge Sebastiao, the chief technology officer of Huawei Technologies; Heinz Sommer, the CEO of HSO; Evan Luthra, the CEO of Startup Studio; as well as Cointelegraph’s Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, who participated in important debates on the role of women in the construction of fintech’s future.  Davos has set the ball rolling in the right direction Despite the crypto-related announcements at the WEF being met with mixed emotions, a number of experts were happy with the fact that more and more world leaders are at least beginning to recognize the overall potential and utility of this novel tech space. In this regard, Francesco Pierangeli, business development and research associate at UCL Center for Blockchain Technologies, told Cointelegraph that he has witnessed a lot of positive movement taking place within the crypto and blockchain sector over the past year, especially at the WEF: “There is a lot going on when it comes to regulations, when it comes to which forms of blockchain are going to make an impact on society. And this is really what Davos is all about — how emerging technologies can be integrated into society for good reasons. There is a lot going on. And I believe that the more we discuss these topics, the more this stuff gets on the agenda of key decision-makers of the world.” Similarly, Jordi Puigneró, Catalonia’s minister for digital policy and public administration, spoke at Tech Dinner — an event organized by CV VC and powered by Cointelegraph. In his speech, Puigneró stated that blockchain will help usher in a new era of governance by empowering citizens and defining new models of trust, similar to how the internet completely revolutionized the way in which people connect and interact with one another. He further pointed out: “The government of Catalonia has already approved and is deploying a blockchain strategy in which one of the first projects will be deploying a self-sovereign identity for Catalan citizens. Digital identity will be an essential framework from which can be developed many new services of the digital economy."" The interviews in Davos were conducted by Kristina Lucrezia Cornèr, Cointelegraph’s managing editor and head of features.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/davos-2020-awaited-regulations-unexpected-enthusiasm-new-challenges,cointelegraph,2020-01-27,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano Inches Toward Smart Contract Implementation with New Paper ,"Cardano ( ADA ) revealed a new paper on Jan. 27 in which the firm details how smart contracts will be implemented in the upcoming Goguen update. Though the system is unique, its release date is still uncertain in light of Cardano’s history of delays. How EUTXO works The Extended UTXO model was specifically designed as an improvement on Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) pure UTXO architecture. In Bitcoin, each transaction is based on the concept of outputs and inputs, representations of specific amounts of BTC. A specific transaction simply takes some Bitcoin in the form of inputs and reshapes them into different outputs. Similar to changing a bill into lower denominations, the number of resulting outputs or their specific amounts are not important, as long as their total value is equal to that of the inputs. The correctness of the transactions is ensured by cryptographic validators that, in Bitcoin’s case, leverage the user’s private key to create a verifiable signature. The researchers explained that, even though this model “plays well with the concurrent and distributed nature of blockchains,” it presents severe limitations to programmability — making it impractical for most smart contracts. By contrast, Ethereum’s ( ETH ) account-based ledger allows for complex computations, but it has to introduce a “shared state” — the collective memory of all transactions and contracts. Cardano’s researchers believe that this model is difficult to secure effectively due to complicated code semantics, which results in incidents such as the  DAO hack . To enable more powerful smart contracts in the UTXO model, the researchers introduced mechanisms that can split the execution of a smart contract into multiple transactions. In Cardano’s model, each transaction output will also have a data field, which can contain arbitrary information connected to a particular smart contract. In addition, the system ensures that a particular chain of outputs uses the same contract code — a concept called contract continuity. The result is a state machine similar to Ethereum’s, where each state change is divided into specific transactions. Long development cycles Cardano’s development is divided into several “eras” named after famous artists and philosophers, each with their own specific focus. The current Shelley era focuses on staking, having  launched  the feature on Cardano’s testnet in December. The next era is Goguen, which focuses on smart contracts. While the two are largely simultaneous, Cardano’s official  roadmap  places the latter’s completion in Q1 2020. Indeed, all remaining phases are set to be completed by the end of 2020. But the project is not new to delays. IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson promised in an April 2019  interview  that both Shelley and Goguen would be released by the end of the year on mainnet. A testing platform for Plutus, Cardano’s smart contract language that uses EUTXO, was  available  since December 2018. The Jan. 2020 paper is just the  formalization  of the model that underpins Plutus. Nevertheless, the release dates of both Shelley and Goguen remain uncertain. In a Jan. 27  community update , Hoskinson revealed that the team is still working on improving the Shelley testnet, with a mainnet release planned no sooner than February. He also revealed that IOHK is taking measures to improve the accuracy of its timeline estimates.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-inches-to-smart-contract-implementation-with-new-paper,cointelegraph,2020-01-28,00:00:00,en
cardano,Other, Charles Hoskinson: Cardano Will Become “the Most Decentralized Cryptocurrency in the World” ,"Cardano will become the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world, 50 to 100 times more decentralized than Bitcoin once all its upgrades are implemented. At least that’s the word according to Cardano co-founder and CEO of IOHK Charles Hoskinson, who caught up with Cointelegraph at  CV Summit , a day-long crypto event running alongside the 50th edition of the  World Economic Forum  in Davos, Switzerland. Speaking with Cointelegraph’s Kristina Cornèr, Hoskinson said he believes the hard fork, consisting of an implementation of the Ouroboros Bizantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Protocol, will be seamless and easy. Following the hard fork, the protocol will undergo a series of additional upgrades which should eventually turn Cardano into the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptos This Week (Feb 2): ETC, LTC, ADA, MIOTA, ZEC ","Several major altcoins have outperformed Bitcoin in January 2020. However, with the reward halving just over three months away, Bitcoin might play catch up. During the previous two halvings, Bitcoin rallied just before and after the event. Weiss Ratings believes that history will repeat itself in the upcoming halving and the only question is how  high  can the rally extend. Bitcoin’s current technical set up has a variety of social media personalities feeling bullish about the digital asset’s future price action. In a recent  market discussion  with Cointelegraph, popular YouTubers The Moon (Carl Runefelt) and DataDash (Nicholas Merten) said that Bitcoin has already entered a bull market when viewed from a longer-term time frame. However, Merten said that a  parabolic  move is unlikely to start until Bitcoin rises above $20,000.  Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 LVC Corporation, the crypto subsidiary of Line, plans to  launch  trading of its LINK digital currency in Japan from April of this year. Although LINK started trading on Line’s international BITBOX cryptocurrency exchange in mid-October 2018, LVC had to wait for the Japan launch due to the strict national cryptocurrency regulations in the country. In other news, Twitter has  added  the Bitcoin emoji, which will show up if the user writes Bitcoin or the BTC hashtag. This new addition was the result of Twitter co-founder and CEO Jack Dorsey suggesting that Unicode, the consortium managing the character standard, include the symbol in its text encoding standard. So far the top crypto performers of this week have all risen more than 25%, which shows that they are backed by momentum but for long can bulls keep it up? Let’s analyze the charts to see what next week has in store for investors.   ETC/USD Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) is the top performer with a stellar run of about 32% in the past seven days. The network  hashrate  of ETC hit a new lifetime high recently and has been able to sustain it, which is a positive sign.  ETC USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The bulls struggled to push the price above the overhead resistance at $10 for the past two weeks. However, the positive thing was that they did not give up much ground, which showed that the bulls were confident of a further rise.  This week, the ETC/USD pair resumed its rally and broke above $10. The sharp up move carried the price to an intra-week high of $12.87278, which is just below the overhead resistance at $14.  The break above $10 has a target objective of $16.60. Though there is a minor resistance at $14, we expect it to be crossed. If the momentum is strong, the rally can extend to $19. However, as RSI is in the overbought zone, the pair might consolidate or enter a minor correction before breaking above $14. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price back below the support at $10. Such a move will indicate a lack of buyers at higher levels. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has seen a sharp rally of about 31% in the past seven days. This move culminated a strong month for the altcoin where it surged about 65% from the lows. This rally has stoked interest among the market participants because, in 2019, LTC had risen about  350%  from January to June. LTC USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The LTC/USD pair will complete a rounding bottom formation if it closes (UTC time) above $66.1486 on the weekly candlestick. This pattern has a target objective of $96.439. However, it is unlikely to be a straight dash towards the target level. The bears are likely to defend the zone between the 50-week SMA at $73 and $80.2731. If the price turns down from this resistance zone, a retest of the breakout level at $66.1486 is possible. If the retest is successful, it might offer a low-risk buying opportunity to the traders. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $66.2486. Such a move will indicate that the current breakout is a bull trap. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ), with a rally of about 31% is the third-best performer. During the week Cardano co-founder and CEO of IOHK Charles Hoskinson  announced  a partnership with PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to build a new commercial strategy. This news was cheered by the market participants and the price of ADA surged. In an  interview  with Cointelegraph, Hoskinson claimed that once all the upgrades of the protocol are implemented, Cardano would become the most decentralized cryptocurrency in the world.  ADA USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The sharp up move this week carried the ADA/USD pair above the overhead resistance level at $0.0461161 and $0.0560221. There is a minor resistance at $0.065229 above which, the rally is likely to pick up steam and move towards its medium-term target zone of $0.10 to $0.10652. The pair has closed in the green for the past five weeks. This shows that bulls are in command. However, the sharp rise in the short-term indicates that the price might have run up too far too soon. Therefore, we anticipate the pair to face stiff resistance in the $0.0560221 to $0.065229 zone.  The price might dip to the breakout level of $0.0461161, which might offer a low-risk buying opportunity. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price breaks down and sustains below $0.0461161. However, we give this a low probability of occurring.  MIOTA/USD IOTA ( MIOTA ) rallied by about 29% in the past seven days to take up the fourth spot among top performers. Bittrex Global added  support  to the IOTA token this week.  MIOTA USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The rally this week has pushed the IOTA/USD pair above the 50-week SMA at $0.288. There is a minor resistance at $0.334574 above which, the rally can extend to $0.385033. We anticipate the bears to aggressively defend this level. If the price turns down from $0.385033, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. However, if the momentum carries the price above $0.385033, the next level to watch out for is $0.541. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $0.244553. However, we give this a low probability of occurring. ZEC/USD Zcash ( ZEC ) rallied roughly 26% this week to make the list in fifth place. The Zcash community has  approved  Zcash mining reward changes that will take effect in November of this year during the coin’s halving.  ZEC USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The ZEC/USD pair has been rising for the past four weeks. Though bears attempted to stall the relief rally at the 50-week SMA, the momentum this week has pushed the price above it. There is a minor resistance at $66.1326. If the bulls can sustain above it, we do not find any significant resistance until the pair reaches the $125.3636 to 139.66 resistance zone.  However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $66.1326, the pair might again dip to $45.67, which is likely to act as a strong support. If the price bounces off this support, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $45.67.

cardano,No Section,Here's What Trading Legend Peter Brandt Has to Say About Cardano (ADA),"Commodity trading vet  Peter Brandt  calls alternative cryptocurrencies  Bitcoin pretenders . However, there is one altcoin that he apparently considers a good buy — Cardano (ADA).  Former IMF economist and ardent Bitcoin hater Mark Dow recently shared a message from his relative who asks whether or nor ADA is a worthy investment. Brandt simply replied ""Buy"" to Dow's tweet without any further explanation.  Buy Dow, who rose to prominence after shorting BTC right after its current all-time high of $20,000, suggested that Brandt simply liked the coin's charts, not its fundamentals.  If he likes it, he likes the chart--which is the smart way--I'd argue the only way--to trade the crypto space. Faith based crypto likely to end in tears more times than not In later November, Dow opined that Bitcoin  was dying  when it was bleeding all the way to the $6,500 level.  ADA has so far had an amazing start of the year after Cardano  successfully launched Shelley's testnet  in December. It has so far pumped by more than 95 percent in 2020, significantly outperforming Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).     Its massive rally is unlikely to stop here. Crypto trader Michael van de Poppe  recently predicted  that ADA could pump the hardest among the top altcoins.  ",https://u.today/heres-what-trading-legend-peter-brandt-has-to-say-about-cardano-ada,utoday,2020-02-07,20:28:00,en

But firstly, he decided to ask the professional about Cardano (ADA) investment prospects. Mr. Dow was adamant about it. Mark Dow is sure that Cardano (ADA) cryptocurrency is a scam and should be avoided as an investment tool. He even advised his relative againist it. Mr. Dow also recommended not to treat cryptocurrencies as a reliable investments at all. He supposes it's better to stay away from crypto in general 'as far as you can'.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Speaks of Possible Stablecoin Launch – Will It Really Happen?,"The  Weiss Ratings  agency that analyses financial products in global markets (including crypto) has tweeted that Cardano’s founder Charles Hoskinson intends to create a stablecoin on Cardano using a mechanism similar to that of DAI. ADA would be the basis for it. The agency points out  that the pattern DAI follows seems to be the best model since it does not have a central point of failure, unlike its rivals USDT or USDC. “We hear that @IOHK_Charles wants to build a version of DAI on Cardano. So far, #DAI is the only trustless #stablecoin in #crypto world, but there should be more. Stablecoins like DAI have no central point of failure, which is a BIG advantage over the likes of #USDT or #USDC.” Charles Hoskinson responded to the tweet, saying that if Cardano does that, it will blow everyone’s mind. He added that he has been considering building a stablecoin for seven years already. If we do this, then it will blow everyone out of the water. I started in this space with stablecoins and we've been thinking about them for seven years  https://t.co/t4FGxW7cLk card Replying to a question from The Cardano Report on how a Cardano-based (and DAI-patterned) stablecoin would benefit ADA users, Hoskinson said that this would increase demand for  ADA  since it would become collateral for the stablecoin. If the coin uses Ada as part of its Central Bank mechanism, it creates demand for the underlying asset. Overall, Weiss Ratings considers ADA to be one of the most undervalued coins and believes it is superior to EOS. Last year, the agency  downgraded the tech score of EOS  several times for a lack of decentralization. ",https://u.today/cardano-founder-speaks-of-possible-stablecoin-launch-will-it-really-happen,utoday,2020-02-12,09:28:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Refreshes Its Architecture by Kicking Off New Node,"On Wednesday, the Cardano team released a major update – a new Cardano Haskell implementation. It is made up of the Cardano Node and the Cardano Explorer Backend with Web API, a  blog post  says. The Cardano team has been working on this upgrade for around a year and a half. The new architectural foundation they have been building is meant to ease the launch of the upcoming Shelley and Goguen releases. The upgrade also promises to allow third-party dev teams to build on Cardano and open the door to enterprise adoption. As per the blog post, the changes will start with the upgrade scheduled for February 20 – Ouroboros BFT. So far, Cardano production remains working on the old implementation of the network node. It says: “After the update to Ouroboros BFT, we will be able to migrate the core nodes that create blocks, while Daedalus users will be able to upgrade later, once the compatible wallet backend is available.” The upgrade will introduce some radical changes to the current design of  Cardano . Unlike the previous node, which was monolithic, the new one is modular. It will make future integrations much easier to implement. The new node will be easy to incorporate into other systems, used by crypto exchanges, for example. “In the new architecture, the node, wallet, and explorer exist as separate components (a new wallet backend will soon be released).” Financial analytical agency, Weiss Ratings, has been  favoring Cardano  for a long time, differentiating it from other blockchains, such as EOS. In a recent tweet, Weiss Ratings wrote that, despite many similarities between Tezos and Cardano, “XTZ is ADA light”. The agency also suggested that the Cardano Foundation is trying to create something much more ambitious than Tezos. #Tezos  &  #ADA  have a lot of similarities.  #XTZ  is ""ADA light"" - It has the majority of ADA's features, though simplified, and because of that Tezos is already up and running. What ADA is trying to build is more ambitious than Tezos, which takes more time.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-refreshes-its-architecture-by-kicking-off-new-node,utoday,2020-02-13,11:04:00,en
cardano, News ," IOHK Donates $500,000 to University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Lab ","IOHK, the software company behind Cardano, announced on Feb. 14 a donation of $500,000 in Cardano ( ADA ) to support and develop the University of Wyoming’s (UW) Blockchain Research and Development Lab. Professor James Caldwell, Assistant Professor Mike Borowczak and Philip Schlump will co-direct the Advanced Blockchain Research and Development Lab. Professor Borowczak told Cointelegprah that IOHK’s donation will be used to support faculty and graduate students in developing practical applications for real-world blockchain use cases. He said: “This funding is meant to directly stimulate and develop a highly qualified workforce in the blockchain sector. Student researchers from undergraduate and graduate levels are at the core of this initiative. Our research and development lab focuses on grounding all work in theory, while developing real-world products.” Source: University of Wyoming Left to right: Caitlin Long, Tom Flynn, Charles Hoskinson, Jim Caldwell, and Cameron Wright. IOHK, which was founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, is built around principles of peer-reviewed academic research. The company is committed to open-source software development, such as hardware for cryptography, authentication and measures against counterfeiting. For example, New Balance is  using  IOHK’s Cardano blockchain to authenticate its products for consumers. According to Professor Caldwell, IOHK’s donation will specifically help with researching practical applications of blockchain, such as supply chain management, tracking the provenance of goods and the advancement of smart contracts. He said: “Our group of researchers will work on a number of projects related to advanced smart-contract development, hardware design and verification for cryptographically secure authentication devices.” Professor Caldwell also mentioned that UW’s Blockchain R&D lab will operate in partnership with IOHK, noting that the team will be working closely with Hoskinson and others on the IOHK research team. He explained: “We expect to send students to visit the Blockchain Technology Laboratory at the University of Edinburgh, which serves as the global headquarters for IOHK’s various university collaborations. This arrangement should work well, since IOHK is at the cutting edge of blockchain technology, and their research model and goals fit perfectly with an academic Computer Science Department.” Professor Borowczak further pointed out that while UW has been offering blockchain-related courses since Jan. 2018 (“Rock The Blockchain Vote” being the first), the university has only been able to support students on an educational level. The funding from IOHK will finally allow this to evolve. He said: “Our students now have the opportunity to help define, develop, and improve the future landscape of blockchain technology. There are many research funding opportunities developing in the blockchain space - the difficulty is finding mutually beneficial partnerships that enable, balance, and respect academic research, student development, and the need for industry return on investment. This partnership leverages the strength, capabilities, and needs of our students, researchers, and IOHK partners.” Another reason why Wyoming is at the forefront of blockchain IOHK’s impressive donation to UW also exhibits Wyoming’s  potential  as one of the leading and most accepting regions in the world for blockchain development. In Jan. 2019, Wyoming  passed  two house bills to create a regulatory framework to foster cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation. Following this, the Wyoming task force  drafted  a bill to define digital currencies as legal forms of money. Recently, Wyoming  developed  a series of rules for “blockchain banks,” which addressed cryptocurrency-focused features such as forks, airdrops and staking. Caitlin Long, a former member of the Wyoming Blockchain Task Force, mentioned that IOHK’s donation will not only help advance university research, but will also benefit the state of Wyoming as a whole. She said: “IOHK’s $500,000 donation, in the native Cardano cryptocurrency, ADA, will not just fund research into real-world uses of blockchain technology, but will also develop Wyoming further as a talent hub for software engineers, trained in the most advanced software development methods in the world.” IOHK Founder, Charles Hoskinson, also commented that Wyoming’s supportive business environment and positive attitude towards blockchain was another reason for investing in UW. He said: “The Wyoming Blockchain Taskforce’s supportive business environment and the excellence of the University of Wyoming’s science research is what led IOHK to choose to invest here. We are incorporated here as a business and are very happy to play a small part in helping embed Wyoming’s position at the global heart of blockchain-based innovation.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/iohk-donates-500-000-to-university-of-wyomings-blockchain-lab,cointelegraph,2020-02-14,00:00:00,en
cardano,Tech,IOHK Opens Cardano Research Lab at University of Wyoming Following $500K Donation,"The Cardano blockchain's lead development firm has established a research center at the University of Wyoming (UW) after making a $500,000 donation in the ADA cryptocurrency. IOHK announced Friday its new research and authentication center would form part of UW's Blockchain Research and Development Lab and would promote the company's academic approach to blockchain development and engineering.  The center will feature a new Plutus development facility, providing blockchain developers with an applied laboratory for writing code in cardano's smart-contract language, as well as tools and resources to experiment with new solutions. There will also be a design studio for a new hardware tool that will provide authentication and anti-counterfeiting applications for cardano. ""This is a very applied laboratory, where instead of doing peer theory, we're actually building real-life things and writing real software that will enter production very quickly,"" IOHK CEO and founder Charles Hoskinson  explained  in an ask-me-anything session.  Ribbon-cutting Hoskinson attended the ceremony marking the opening of the research lab at UW's main campus in the city of Laramie on Friday. IOHK's butterfly logo will be added to the research lab, which will be at the center for IOHK's future work with the livestock traceability platform BeefChain, according to Hoskinson. As part of its collaboration with UW, IOHK has also provided a $500,000 grant in ADA to fund research and development into new blockchain applications, including new traceability tools and supply chain management.  The state of Wyoming is expected to match the dollar value of the grant, meaning UW will receive $1 million worth of initial funding for the new blockchain facility, a university spokesperson confirmed to CoinDesk. The university itself will contribute further supporting funds, though a total dollar amount wasn't shared. ""The University of Wyoming is proud to be at the forefront of blockchain research and education, and we are grateful for this significant financial contribution from IOHK,"" said UW acting president Neal Theobald. ""This support will help us continue to move forward in a very exciting and promising field of innovation and discovery."" Wyoming is an attractive destination for U.S.-based cryptocurrency companies that want to take advantage of the state's crypto-friendly legislation that formally  recognizes  digital assets and provides companies with access to financial services.  ""Our hope is to have a very substantial presence in Wyoming and write a lot of very good software there,"" Hoskinson said. IOHK is officially incorporated in Wyoming, while cryptocurrency exchange Kraken has been  looking  for a new operations director who can help the exchange become fully regulated in the state. UW is the fourth academic institution to host an IOHK blockchain lab. The company has centers attached to the University of Edinburgh, the University of Athens and the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Although IOHK has collaborated with academics at the University of Connecticut and Virginia Commonwealth University, UW will be the first American campus to be fully affiliated with the company. An IOHK spokesperson said the company was not at the stage where it knows how many people will be employed at the UW research center or when the center will be fully operational.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/02/14/iohk-opens-cardano-research-lab-at-university-of-wyoming-following-500k-donation/,coindesk,2020-02-14,17:58:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Can Bring Fresh New Perspective to Crypto But It Needs Time: Weiss Ratings,"Cardano  is currently ranked 11 on the CoinMarketCap’s scale. It seems to be favored by the Weiss Ratings agency that deals with financial analytics. Several times in the past,  Weiss Ratings has picked Cardano  to call it superior to some other blockchains, e.g., EOS. A few times in 2019, the agency downgraded the tech score of EOS for lack of decentralization and predicted a great future to Cardano. Now, Weiss Ratings is again tweeting praise about Cardano, saying that it is likely to bring a fresh new perspective to crypto. The agency also expects Cardano to make a contribution to the DeFi sphere. However, innovations require a lot of research, which in its turn requires time, writes Weiss Ratings. #Cardano  has a way of bringing a fresh new perspective to crypto, and there's often a ton of research behind that perspective. We're looking forward to seeing what contribution it can make to  #DeFi  which, in our view, is the most exciting thing going on in crypto right now. $ADA card Recently, U.Today reported that Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, spoke of a possibility of launching a  stablecoin based on a DAI-pattern and powered by ADA . Weiss Ratings back then commented that the structure of DAI is more beneficial compared to USDC and Tether’s USDT. Weiss Ratings jumps back to this topic in a  recent tweet  as well. “A DAI-like token on #Cardano would bring tremendous value to the #ADA token - it would give birth to an entire #DeFi ecosystem that would rely mainly on it as a source of collateral. DeFi brought tons of utility to #ETH, it can do the same for ADA.”",https://u.today/cardano-ada-can-bring-fresh-new-perspective-to-crypto-but-it-needs-time-weiss-ratings,utoday,2020-02-15,18:22:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano ADA to Release New Ouroborous BFT Protocol, Hardfork Announced","Tim Harrison, Marketing & Communications Director at Cardano (ADA)  confirmed  that a brand-new Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance (OBFT) consensus protocol will be released tomorrow. It has been revealed that after 18 months of development, the  Cardano (ADA)  team is ready to update its main algorithm, Ouroboros Classic, to Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerance (OBFT). While the first one is associated with Byron Mainnet, the OBFT is the last stage of system evolution before the Ouroboros Genesis which will power the Shelley Mainnet. This upgrade will occur on February 20, 2020, within the Epoch 176 of the Cardano (ADA) network. Neither ADA holders nor the participants of Shelley Incentivized testnet have been asked to do anything during the time of the upgrade. The end-users will benefit from this anticipated update from its very early days. According to the official statement, the system performance (transactions per second, TPS) will be improved as well as blockchain adaptability and portability. Mr. Harrison also outlined that this novelty will re-consider the decentralization of the Cardano (ADA) blockchain as it will  enable the evolution of Cardano on the Byron era, with its federated blockchain, to the decentralized Shelly era. Most commonly, users on the Cardano (ADA) YouTube channel appreciated the upcoming release. Yet, due to the fact that, according to Mr. Harrison, the next update following the OBFT release will be shipped ‘over the next few months’, some of Cardanians are suspicious. The critics remember that Charles Hoskinson saying the Shelley Mainnet will be launched in Q1, 2020. Despite past commitments, now the release of Shelley may be delayed until Q2, 2020.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-to-release-new-ouroborous-bft-protocol-hardfork-announced,utoday,2020-02-19,16:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano to Undergo Network Upgrade in Preparation for Shelley ,"The Cardano ( ADA ) network will perform a scheduled upgrade on Feb. 20 to introduce Ouroboros BFT, an improved consensus mechanism. The update is an intermediate step between the current Byron era and Shelley, which will introduce staking on mainnet. Announced  by IOHK on Feb. 19, the upgrade will be executed on Thursday at 9:44 PM UTC, or 4:44 PM EST. The network will undergo a hard fork, though the team emphasizes that “it is a planned and managed protocol upgrade.” What is Ouroboros BFT? The new protocol is a development over the original Ouroboros “Classic,” which is currently active on Cardano’s mainnet. While Ouroboros is a provably secure proof-of-stake consensus protocol, the original version made several compromises in decentralization. Namely, the list of validators is currently fixed and their succession is known ahead of time. Cardano’s Shelley era focuses entirely on removing the “training wheels” and letting the community decide on block validators through staking. It will be powered by Ouroboros Praos, which adds several features to make it much harder to corrupt validators. In between the two major eras, the Cardano team decided to split the transition into two hard forks. The decision was taken to ensure that no interruptions to network service occur as its validation is delegated to the community. Shelley timeline The Cardano team suffered strong setbacks in its Shelley plans. While it was initially planned to be released before the end of 2019, the team was only able to  launch  an incentivized testnet in December. The testnet was an important step in preparing for Shelley, helping create a staking community in a safe environment. In the meantime, Cardano is also working on every subsequent phase, such as  smart contracts . Following a commitment to improve timeline estimates, Cardano delivered the hard fork on time. In January, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson  promised  a mid-February date for the upgrade.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-to-undergo-network-upgrade-in-preparation-for-shelley,cointelegraph,2020-02-20,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Hard Fork Successfully Launched as Shelley Mainnet Looms,"IOHK CEO  Charles Hoskinson  has just made an announcement about the successful launch of the Ouroboros BFT hard fork, which bridges Byron with the forthcoming Shelley era.  Hardfork successful. The OBFT era has begun The upgrade of Cardano's proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol took place on Feb. 20 without affecting ADA users. The OBFT fork was deployed on the federated Byron mainnet. It represents an evolution of the original Ouroboros Classic protocol and allows Cardano to move closer to flipping the switch on centralization.  As  reported by U.Today , IOHK's Tim Harrison explained that the Cardano network would able to achieve higher transaction speed as well as its portability after the upgrade.  It is worth noting that this hard fork is only one of the network upgrades that are going to happen before the advent of the Shelley era. While an exact timeline remains unclear, these upgrades are expected to be shipped in about two months by Harrison.   The Shelley mainnet, which will be powered by the Ouroboros Genesis protocol, is expected to turn Cardano into  the most decentralized  blockchain project. It will allow the community to pick their own validators via staking.   ",https://u.today/cardano-ada-hard-fork-successfully-launched-as-shelley-mainnet-looms,utoday,2020-02-21,06:16:00,en

The network now runs on a better consensus mechanism. What is more, this is a big step towards implementing Shelley on the network.  A recent blog post  published on Medium explains why. When Cardano spread the word about  the hard fork launch  on Twitter three days ago, it said that this upgrade was to “pave the way for the Shelley mainnet release.” UPDATE:  #Cardano  OBFT hard fork successfully completed! ? ? ?

Although, Cardano users cannot vote for validators and choose those themselves.

Shelley will be launched in two steps so as the network remains intact, without any interruptions. Initially, Shelley was planned to launch back in late 2019. But the team face several major setbacks and had to handle those.

cardano, News , PwC Legal Leader: Cardano is a 'Huge Part' of the Decentralized Future ,"The legal leader at Big Four auditor PwC, Gunther Dobrauz, recently praised the people responsible for Cardano’s ( ADA ) development. A huge part of the future In a Mar. 3  tweet , Dobrauz claimed that he has long been saying that decentralization is the future. Furthermore, he added that the Cardano Foundation and the team surrounding IOHK CEO and founder  Charles Hoskinson  “are a huge part of this” future. IOHK is the blockchain firm behind Cardano and Ethereum Classic. Dobrauz’s tweet also featured a photo where he stood beside Hoskinson. A tweet sent shortly afterward by Hoskinson reveals that he met Dobrauz during his visit to PwC’s London headquarters. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Dobrauz was quick to call these his own views rather than PwC’s, but he believes blockchain technology to be transformative. He added: “I have followed the work of the Cardano team and indeed the Cardano ecosystem more or less from the beginning and personally believe that they are doing an amazing job and enjoy every opportunity to exchange with and learn from them. The same is true for some other projects out there.” PwC’s relationship with blockchain and crypto This is not the first example of contact between PwC and Cardano. In a late January YouTube  livestream , Hoskinson said that PwC will drive a Cardano commercialization strategy. Hoskinson said that Emurgo, an entity tasked with driving Cardano adoption, IOHK and Cardano foundation are working to unify their Cardano commercialization strategy and PwC acts as a moderator in this effort. He noted that he expected PwC to prepare and then create a consolidated strategy for the commercialization of Cardano’s technology in February. Furthermore, PwC has shown interest in the broader blockchain and cryptocurrency landscape multiple times in the past. For instance, in mid-January the auditor  let  smart contract auditing team ChainSecurity join its firm. PwC said at the time that it hoped that with ChainSecurity’s team the firm will become “the world’s leader in smart contract auditing.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/pwc-legal-leader-cardano-is-a-huge-part-of-the-decentralized-future,cointelegraph,2020-03-04,00:00:00,en

Though, they sometimes publish their opinions on blockchain projects and events as well. Today, IOTA (MIOTA) and Cardano (ADA) have been put under a microscope. According to Weiss Crypto Ratings, the two projects have very little in common. Cardano's (ADA) approach seems to be much more realistic than the one demonstrated by IOTA. IOTA is still looking for a way  to design its consensus , while Cardano ' is well along the roadmap ' to meaningful milestones on its way from theory to practice. 1/

cardano, Analysis ," Blockchain R&D Funding Is Vital, but It Mostly Comes From One Source ","On March 4, Twitter topman Jack Dorsey’s digital-assets payment company Square Crypto  released  a statement showcasing its support for Bitcoin ( BTC ) development with the creation of a grant program that aims to contribute toward the enhancement of the premier cryptocurrency’s native ecosystem. More specifically, the company revealed that its grant program is open to developers interested in pursuing this field of work. Two developers have already  received  monetary support from the company: BTCPay Server received $100,000 to continue its work relating to Square’s open-source payment processor, and a pseudonymous developer received an undisclosed sum for working on the  Lightning Network . The folks over at Square also mentioned that they are currently funding  research  that is being driven by Jon Atack and Tankred Hase, two BTC developers who have been active in the space for quite some time. Nothing new here This is hardly the first time a mainstream organization has entered the burgeoning domain of crypto research. Earlier this year, IOHK  gave out  $500,000 worth of Cardano’s Ada ( ADA ) currency to the University of Wyoming’s  blockchain  lab. According to a representative of the firm, the Ada tokens will not just fund research into real-world uses of blockchain technology but will also foster Wyoming as a talent hub for software engineering and for the advancement of novel software development methods related to advanced technologies like blockchain, the Internet of Things, etc. Ankit Bhatia, the co-founder and CEO of Sapien, an  Ethereum -based social network, spoke to Cointelegraph on the issue of big-name financial entities driving traditional crypto research and the implications such moves may have on the ecosystem at large. He said that more often than not, the best crypto developers work independently or in small teams. Established companies are thus usually forced to issue favorably conditioned grants to tap into the space’s innovation and thereby “leech off the credibility” of the leaders operating within this domain: “While these companies often provide genuine support to these devs, with cash and other resources, players like Square Crypto need more legitimacy to crack open the crypto community and find monetization.” Other established organizations such as Chaincode Labs,  Xapo , Blockstream,  BitMEX  and  OKCoin  have also served as patrons for many developers who have been working to make the crypto ecosystem more future ready and secure. The shortage of research funding is quite glaring As things stand, Bitcoin is widely considered to be one of the most critical codebases in the world. While the currency itself has attracted a lot of attention in recent years, a deep review of its code is still severely  lacking . Deep reviews are essentially thorough, routine inspections that are carried out within a project’s codebase to weed out any frailties or exploits that may be present in its fundamental design. In fact, quality code reviewers are so scarce these days that the domain itself has turned into a microeconomy of sorts. To put things into perspective, the  Bitcoin Core  project alone is currently faced with an ever-deepening pool of over 750 open issues and more than 350 pull requests that need reviewing. These deep reviews are quite complex in nature, and even highly-skilled developers can sometimes take weeks or even months to resolve them. One of the most striking cases in which this lack of review became apparent was in September 2018, when an inflation bug was detected within Bitcoin’s code. The bug  provided  troublemakers with an open-ended route to create Bitcoin out of thin air; however, the issue was quickly resolved once the gravity of the situation was established. But that does not mean that such exploits will never reappear in the future. The world seems to be  transitioning  into an era of decentralization, and sovereign nations may look to compromise digital currencies because they hold the potential to challenge the supremacy of state-issued fiat assets. Joe Vezzani, the CEO and founder of the crypto-insights platform LunarCRUSH, told Cointelegraph that grants usually come with certain conditions, especially in cases pertaining to early stage technologies: “Most grants are not large enough in size and while they are immensely beneficial for early-stage companies, unless the amount is extremely huge, outside financing is still needed for success.” Grants from companies like Square are good for the crypto ecosystem Some members of the global Bitcoin community have  raised  questions regarding Square’s decision to start doling out Bitcoin-specific grants, as they could adversely influence the platform’s future development efforts. When large, nonnative companies dive into spaces like this, they’re typically met with wariness and skepticism from all ends. This is mostly because they did not invest any capital or put in any effort into bringing blockchain and decentralization into the mainstream when the sector was still in its infancy. However, such an outlook is not shared by every expert within the community. Adrian Pollard, the co-founder and chief product officer bitHolla — a platform that sets up crypto exchanges — told Cointelegraph that Square’s decision to start giving out grants to “worthy” developers is mutually beneficial for all parties involved, citing the company’s 50%  increase  in profits from offering Bitcoin via its native smartphone app: “As far as I know, Square’s grant is the most generous and productive because its purpose is solely to enhance the Bitcoin protocol. I believe it has the greatest chance of affecting positive change.” When asked about some of the dubious eligibility conditions outlined by Square for its grants — such as developers having to be “in good standing” with the global Bitcoin community — Pollard added that these stipulations are only in place because the approval of multiple parties, such as other developers, crypto exchanges, users and miners, is required for any meaningful change to take place in Bitcoin’s core protocol. He added that anyone not in touch with the community has “very little chance of affecting change and Square understands this.” Bhatia shared a similar sentiment, alluding to Square’s increasing reliance on Bitcoin to rake in its profits. He believes other companies that are operating within this nascent space will also try to cash in on this opportunity and dish out sizable monetary grants. What are some of the strings that come attached to research grants? Even though developers are sometimes required to meet certain milestones in order to receive the next round of funds to continue with their development efforts, Vezzani believes that there are usually no legal strings attached to early stage small grants. In his view, if a developer has been awarded a grant, they probably have a good relationship with the giving party to begin with. That being said, there are some niche caveats in most agreements that are usually not disclosed. For example, donors often demand a free and perpetual license for the projects they are funding while still enabling creators to conduct their business in a manner they see fit. Similarly, developers often give investors access to their research knowledge repositories, as it could give them a head start in understanding the direction in which the sector may be heading. Speaking on the subject, Adel de Meyer, the CEO of the fully private blockchain Daps Coin, told Cointelegraph that contractual agreements between top companies and developers are usually never made public, so it is hard to establish if there are any strings attached to the deals: “I don’t believe top-notch developers on Bitcoin would agree to give their research over to a private company as their IP to hold onto. I believe that most grants being issued by mainstream players require that the project has to be open-source, meaning that the success of the innovation is shared with the whole to tap into, for free. This leads to crypto tech being able to blossom as it doesn’t narrow or limit further innovation.” Where do most grants come from? As things stand, it seems as though it is mostly independent companies and organizations that are financing crypto research, as only they have the monetary capacity. While the popular belief is that universities are funding most of the blockchain and crypto research taking place today, it actually appears as though their budgets are  becoming  increasingly limited. Similarly, governments don't seem to be interested in supporting research related to decentralized technologies, as they have the potential to threaten their position of power and control. Bhatia opined that money-making is what drives independent companies to issue grants: “They see their need to achieve a certain vision or goal and may lack the expertise themselves. Issuing grants or bounties outsources the project management and recruitment costs and hopefully sparks innovation when presented with several ideas. Grants programs are also very useful for ensuring that firms build products that serve their target communities since most applicants are very likely drawn from that same talent pool.” Vezzani is of the belief that most grants these days come from large nonprofit organizations that are mostly funded by private donors in fields that traditionally have longer monetization life cycles. Pollard told Cointelegraph that while there are occasional grants coming in from universities, they are futile 99.9% of the time, since most researchers operating out of these institutions are rarely in touch with members of the global Bitcoin community.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-rd-funding-is-vital-but-it-mostly-comes-from-one-source,cointelegraph,2020-03-11,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Ethereum Co-Founder Pronounces 20th Century World Order Dead ,"Ethereum  co-founder and founder of  Cardano , Charles Hoskinson, pronounced “the economic order of the 20th century” dead in a recent YouTube  livestream .  By “the economic order of 20th century”, Hoskinson means a centralized hierarchical economy that was built through “a series of treaties” made by a few great powers, this economy was built for the times  “when information was not instantaneous”, and when most people were willing to accept “big brother’s” dictum. Hoskinson said that the  recent market downturn  was caused by the incongruence of the hierarchical order created by powerful institutions like governments, corporations, international organizations, where few powerful entities decide the fates of billions. This centralized hierarchical structure no longer represents the world we are living in, the world that is becoming flat and decentralized, he said. According to Hoskinson, the new decentralized order ushered by blockchain technology is meant to solve some of the most pressing issues of modernity such as data ownership, privacy, and identity; an order in which there will purportedly be no need for CEOs or presidents. No more empires Hoskinson believes that the very fabric of the world order is unraveling before our eyes:  “What we are looking at right now is the unraveling of the economic order of the 20th century... Winners and losers that had certain assumptions about how power should work, how money should work, how credit should work, how finance should work, how information needs to flow. And this economy was sustainable and stable when information was not instantaneous. And when it was totally acceptable to have empires, meaning one or two nation-states being supreme above all others and establishing all the rules and regulations.” Will the European Union survive? Hoskinson claims that the old system was patching up the old economy with things like easy credit, which led to “a five-fold increase” in the United States national debt in less than 20 years. In Japan’s case, the Olympics was supposed to kickstart the country’s stagnating economy, but it will not happen because of the “global pandemic” known as the coronavirus. He points to Italy, where “16 million people” may potentially be quarantined. Hoskinson believes this will lead to the election of a populist government: “And we'll probably see an Italian version of Brexit come. And can the European Union survive if Italy leaves? Perhaps France next.” The U.S. sacrifices millions of lives for Donald Trump to get re-elected After lashing out at international governments, Hoskinson hits the U.S. establishment: “Our president and the opposition party could have set their petty rivalries aside and said it's for the good of our people. We should work together instead. What did they do? They looked at it like a political game. And they said, hey, let's go ahead and see who could score the most points. A recession is bad for the incumbent president. So let's just make sure that that happens regardless. And meanwhile, the other side is ignoring the fact that we are entering into a pandemic and millions of people could die because they don't want the markets to collapse. It's disgusting.” No need for a central authority Hoskinson believes that the establishment for the past 10 years has paid no attention to epidemiologists’ warnings about “a global pandemic that could kill two hundred million people and collapse the global economy. It was one of the [last] priorities of the world order.” He summarizes, “You are seeing a lack of fundamental integrity. People do not have faith that the institutions we have can protect us and allow us to address the problems of the 21st century.” He unequivocally states: “We no longer need central authority. We no longer need presidents, kings, governors, leaders, CEOs to get things done.” Crypto is not about “fast returns” Hoskinson states that the cryptocurrency industry is not about “fast returns” or “the price of Bitcoin,” but it is about disrupting the old way of doing things: “It has everything to do with a global conversation about changing the way we do things, not just in institutions. Whether we should put power in one or the other about removing the need overall from institutions.” The movement for decentralization is built on “immutable rules” that do not bend with the wind, do not care about politics, natural disasters or plague. These rules behave similarly to the “laws of physics,” and because of that, they are fundamentally better to build upon. People want to live in a world where they control their digital assets Hoskinson believes that people are fed up living in a society where old-world institutions control their financial accounts, data and identity. According to him, they are ready to take back control. He also observes that the “fastest-growing browser right now” is  Brave , built on “the foundations of a cryptocurrency.” At current adoption rates, the browser may be more popular than Google Chrome in five years. Hoskinson’s message to the crypto community: Relax! Towards the end of the stream, Hoskinson addresses the crypto community with calming words, stating that the crypto industry is more resilient than traditional markets, which panic when they shed 10%, whilst crypto space is used to collapses of 90%. He believes it’s important to keep the big picture in mind and says what this industry is building will fundamentally change the way society operates. Despite some philosophical differences that he may have with rivals like EOS and Tezos, Hoskinson says “this industry as a whole is philosophically aligned about killing the middle man and building a better world for everybody.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-co-founder-pronounces-20th-century-world-order-dead,cointelegraph,2020-03-13,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Cardano to Roll Out Commercial Infrastructure, Denies Coronavirus Delay ","Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain Cardano ( ADA ) is working on implementing commercial infrastructure. The coin’s officials have reassured the public that development is on schedule. During a March 13 YouTube  livestream , Charles Hoskinson — the CEO of IOHK, the firm behind Cardano — said that official updates about the coin’s critical commercial infrastructure should be expected in the coming months, but reassured that things are proceeding as expected. Hoskinson explained that the people involved in the coin’s development are starting to set aside funding for dedicated commercial infrastructure, which he explained as follows: “Cardano commercially critical infrastructure are things that Cardano needs for it — in our view — to be competitive against other cryptocurrencies.” Hoskinson said that such infrastructure needs to ensure decentralized applications, such as the DeFi protocols, work properly on the blockchain. He also mentioned the Jormungandr node software is about to see an update that will allow for easier retiring of stake pools. Hoskinson also claimed that Cardano’s development team is making good progress on the next network update, Shelley. He said that the number of bugs reported in the Shelley testnet has massively decreased over the last three weeks and the stability of the software is increasing. Coronavirus doesn’t affect Cardano development Recently, several industry news outlets reported that Cardano’s Shelley update will be postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hoskinson was quick to deny such reports and call them “fake news” on  Twitter  earlier today. Hoskinson was quite vocal about his high hopes for blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and decentralized finance largely changing how the world functions. As Cointelegraph recently  reported , Hoskinson announced that “the economic order of the 20th century” is dead. He was referring to the centralized hierarchical economy that was built through “a series of treaties” made by a few great powers.

Z/Yen Group — Former Research Partner Z/Yen Group Limited is a fintech think tank and a former research partner of the Foundation. Back in 2018, the two  co-authored  a report entitled “The Quantum Countdown: Quantum Computing and the Future of Distributed Ledger Encryption.”  Interestingly, Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, in a YouTube Ask Me Anything live stream from March 15,  mentioned  that his company is doing research on quantum-resistant signatures. IP rights dispute? The information released by the Cardano Information on the nature of these “legal proceedings” is scant: “The proceedings relate to an alleged agreement between the Z/Yen Group Limited and the Cardano Foundation dated July 2017. The Cardano Foundation voided/terminated the agreement for various reasons. The Cardano Foundation fully rejects the claims raised by the Z/Yen Group Limited. Due to the ongoing nature of this judiciary process, no further information will be given while proceedings are in progress.” Based on this information, one can only speculate that the case raises the issue of the ownership of intellectual property.

cardano,Markets,Fintech Think Tank Takes Legal Action Against Cardano Foundation,"A London-based think tank has brought legal action against the Cardano Foundation for allegedly terminating a 2017 agreement. The Zug, Switzerland-based group supporting the blockchain and cryptocurrency project confirmed in a  blog post  Monday that Z/Yen had initiated legal proceedings against it.  ""It is our obligation to inform the Cardano community of legal proceedings recently initiated by the Z/Yen Group Limited (UK) against the Cardano Foundation (Switzerland),"" the foundation said. The dispute revolves around a reported agreement between the two organizations that the foundation allegedly terminated or voided for reasons not disclosed in the blog post.  ""The Cardano Foundation fully rejects the claims raised by the Z/Yen Group Limited,"" the blog post reads, adding it would not provide any further information while proceedings were underway. However, the agreement in question appears to be one made in December 2017, when the foundation  partnered  with Z/Yen's Distributed Futures practice for collaborating on new research papers, as well as exploring potential applications for Cardano and its ADA cryptocurrency.  At the time, Michael Parsons, the foundation's then-chairman and executive director, described the Z/Yen partnership as ""extremely important."" He said the two organizations would work together on the ongoing development of new tools and functionalities that would help increase industry understanding of governance and regulatory issues.  In February 2018, the Cardano Foundation's official Twitter account  posted  about an event run by ""our research partner"" Z/Yen, for exploring how quantum computing could be used for blockchain security. Later that year, Z/Yen announced plans to experiment with smart ledgers for administering pension schemes, which would be sponsored by the Cardano Foundation according to a  press release.   Charles Hoskinson, founder and CEO of IOHK, a Cardano developer,  said  the lawsuit is a ""commercial dispute"" and a ""leftover"" from the former administration of the foundation. He added that none of Z/Yen's research had been used in the Cardano protocol. Z/Yen's co-founder and executive chairman, Michael Mainelli ,told CoinDesk neither he or Z/Yen were able to comment on the legal case while it was undergoing judicial consideration.

That’s the authority that they’ve given us: to print money and provide liquidity into the financial system.” The idea of the Federal Reserve being given the go-ahead to print an infinite amount of new money, sparked Hoskinson’s comparison to OneCoin. As Cointelegraph  reported , the OneCoin scam made at least $4 billion from unsuspecting investors, unaware that the token they were buying into had no underlying value. Pomp and CZ slightly less blunt Other industry figures were quick to weigh in with their own, perhaps slightly more measured, takes on the matter. Morgan Creek Digital co-founder, Anthony Pompliano,  tweeted  about the U.S. Dollar’s now-unlimited supply, saying: “History tells us that this is not sustainable long-term for a currency.” Meanwhile, Binance CEO, CZ, gave the Fed an Economics 101 in his  tweet , posing the following teaser: “Ever heard about ‘supply, demand and price’? What happens to price when you have infinite supply?” Bitcoin (BTC) price reacted to the news by blasting back up through the $6,000 level and onwards up to $6,500 at time of publication.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-chief-compares-us-dollar-to-onecoin-scam-as-fed-keeps-printing,cointelegraph,2020-03-23,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Releases Hydra Solution to Accelerate Micropayments,"Ouroboros Hydra (Hydra) is an off-chain protocol that IOHK has been working on for five years. It promises to give  the Cardano network  some substantial improvements in terms of scaling. A press release shared with U.Today has it that IOHK has released Ouroboros Hydra – an off-chain protocol created by the IOHK team and the company’s partners from the DLT research lab at Edinburgh University. The team took five years to create Hydra and now, the press release says, it is going to give Cardano some crucial improvements. As per the press release, Hydra allows increasingly higher scalability for the  Cardano  network and, at the same time, will ensure low latency and minimal storage of data per node. Hydra will also allow developers to build various dapps, such as those that deal with micropayments, voting, etc. – everything where low fees and instantly confirmed operations are required. The new solution will allow users to connect to the network and simultaneously create ten extra ‘heads’. Each of those will create an extra ‘lane’ of throughput for transactions and data. This will enable the system to work much faster and greatly increase its scalability. Trials have shown that each ‘head’ created by Hydra is capable of processing about 1,000 transactions a second. The more heads are created on the protocol, the higher the scalability. The document states: “Hydra enables Cardano to scale horizontally, increasing performance by incorporating additional nodes, rather than vertically, through the addition of more powerful hardware.” Among other options, Hydra allows facilitating faster micropayments on Cardano and making the fees substantially lower.",https://u.today/cardano-releases-hydra-solution-to-accelerate-micropayments,utoday,2020-03-25,10:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano CEO Thinks Trump is Calling America’s Bluff With Easter Reopening ,"Pundits and public health experts alike are reeling at President Donald Trump’s  pledge  to get “the country opened up and rarin’ to go by Easter,” whatever the risks of coronavirus may be. With Easter less than three weeks away, the president has diverged from the advice of public health authorities worldwide,  tweeting  on March 24 that: “Our people want to return to work. They will practice Social Distancing and all else, and Seniors will be watched over protectively & lovingly. We can do two things together. THE CURE CANNOT BE WORSE (by far) THAN THE PROBLEM! Congress MUST ACT NOW. We will come back strong!” While many have responded with shock and concern at what appears to be the president privileging economic health over public health,  Ethereum  co-founder and founder of  Cardano  Charles Hoskinson is not taking Trump’s commitments at face value. In a tweet  posted  on March 24, he wrote: “Here is my prediction. I could be totally wrong but I think Trump is actually going to shut down the country with a full quarantine at the end of his 15 day guidelines next week. The speculation about reopening is to prevent people from panicking or relocating.” Hoskinson’s forecast that America is en route to a full-on lockdown was met with some skepticism in the crypto community.  One pointed to the president’s own  vested interests  to get the economy back up and running as soon as possible, while another  said  Hoskinson was crediting Trump with too much ingenuity. Former Democratic presidential hopeful and cryptocurrency advocate Andrew Yang  tweeted  his own view on March 24: “You know what will revive the economy?  Suppressing and containing the virus. That’s it.” Earlier today, Binance CEO Chanpeng Zhang  argued  that the COVID-19 outbreak was likely to set a new bar for the cryptocurrency markets.  The trillions involved in the Federal Reserve’s unprecedented stimulus package, he claimed, have made a $2 trillion Bitcoin ( BTC ) market cap with 1 BTC at $100,000 “no longer such a hard to imagine number.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-ceo-thinks-trump-is-calling-americas-bluff-with-easter-reopening,cointelegraph,2020-03-25,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Just Like Bitcoin Before It, Cardano Is Banned From Wikipedia ","On March 24, Cardano ( ADA ) founder,  Charles Hoskinson ,  streamed  a YouTube video titled “On Wikipedia,” in which he berated Wikipedia for applying arbitrary commercial censorship against Cardano. Wikipedia’s censorship of Bitcoin may have led to Satoshi’s disappearance Censorship of cryptocurrency projects is as old as the industry itself. Back in 2010, even Satoshi Nakamoto was frustrated with Wikipedia’s editors for  removing  Bitcoin’s wiki entry several times.  After PayPal severed ties with WikiLeaks, one of Bitcoin’s supporters suggested that becoming the site's new source of donations would generate enough publicity to gain entry into Wikipedia. Satoshi strongly  opposed  WikiLeak’s adoption of the cryptocurrency, but it was too late: “No, don't ""bring it on"". The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage.” Cardano & SpankChain Hoskinson states that he does not know the rationale behind Wikipedia’s hostility towards his project, despite it being “the most cited of all of the peer reviewed coins”: “We don't know why there's hostility where coins like SpankChain can have an article on Wikipedia. A lot of other cryptocurrencies and top 15, top 20 apparently have articles and that's perfectly fine. But then we're not allowed to have an article for some reason, even though we've been mentioned by the U.S. Congress.” Cointelegraph could not find a Wikipedia article for SpankChain ( SPANK ). Other projects like Dogecoin ( DOGE ), GridCoin ( GRC ), and PotCoin ( POT ) do have one, however. Most of the top ten projects, including Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), have one too. Source: Cointelegraph Hoskinson  confirmed  to Cointelegraph that the censorship comes exclusively from Wikipedia’s English language editors, noting that there are Cardano wiki entries in German, Estonian, Italian, Japanese, Dutch, Portuguese, Romanian and Russian.  Crypto censorship  has recently been on the rise. In Wikipedia’s case, it is an especially surprising move, considering that the site accepts Bitcoin to help fund its mission of providing “a free online encyclopedia, created and edited by volunteers around the world”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/just-like-bitcoin-before-it-cardano-is-banned-from-wikipedia,cointelegraph,2020-03-25,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano Releases Solution that Scales More Than Visa’s Payment Network ,"On March 25, Cardano launched its off-chain scalability protocol, Ouroboros Hydra, after 5 years of development. An announcement sent to Cointelegraph claims that the protocol vastly increased scalability and low latency for the Cardano blockchain while using little storage on the network’s nodes. The solution also reportedly allows for applications such as micropayments, voting, insurance contracts, and other uses that require low fees or instant transactions. According to a spokesperson of IOHK — the firm behind Cardano — Hydra is the result of a five-year European Union-funded collaborative research  project , and could theoretically scale to a million transactions per second. Such a throughput is — according to him — in excess of the current generation of global payment systems. In Hydra, each user who connects to the network generates 10 heads, which are throughput lanes for data and transactions. Because of that, the system reportedly gets faster and decreases its latency as it scales. More scalable than Visa Simulations made by the University of Edinburgh show that each Hydra head can handle around 1,000 transactions per second, but according to the announcement, the process can be further optimized. The announcement reads: “With 1000 heads the network could theoretically scale to a million transactions per second - comfortably in excess of current global payment systems such as VISA.” Furthermore, according to the announcement, Hydra approaches the theoretical maximum amount of transactions possible within the limitations of network speed, geographical distance, and the number of participants. The paper reads: “Essentially, the bottleneck becomes the network connection between the participants, not the protocol.” The IOHK spokesperson did not answer Cointelegraph's inquiry by press time. Scalability is blockchain’s holy grail Director of Edinburgh University’s Blockchain Laboratory, Aggelos Kiayias, commented on the development: “Solving the scalability question is the holy grail for the whole blockchain space. The time has come to apply a principled, evidence-based approach in designing and engineering blockchain scalability solutions and this research is a decisive step in this direction.” Recent evidence  suggests  that the Ethereum Foundation gave up on its second-layer solution, Plasma, without announcing it.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-releases-solution-that-scales-more-than-visas-payment-network,cointelegraph,2020-03-26,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Releases Upgraded Byron Codebase: What's New,"The Byron 'reboot', which will be available on March 31, 2020, is considered to be the most meaningful software update since the initial release of Cardano in 2017. According to the statement of the IOHK Team, this release will reconsider the design of all Cardano (ADA) blockchain elements as it upgrades the performance of the Cardano node, Cardano explorer, the wallet backend, and the Daedalus wallet, itself.  But the most important is the fact that, with Byron reboot, the logics of the interaction between blockchain components will be reorganized. The new release will make the codebase modular, separating the ledger, consensus, and network components of the node. This, in turn, will allow  any one of them to be changed, tweaked, and upgraded without affecting the others. With this release, Cardano (ADA) network is one step closer to the release of Shelley mainnet. With the new version of Byron, the system will support all of the imminent features of Shelley, as well as numerous possible future developments. The new node update will be rolled out to more core and relay nodes on the Cardano mainnet within the next few weeks, followed by other reboot improvements and the Daedalus beta in the coming months. Charles Hoskinson, CEO of IOHK, outlined that: At the most fundamental level, the Byron reboot will improve the performance of the entire Cardano network. Transaction throughput capacity will significantly increase, and the network will be able to handle much higher demand and transactions per second. Also, he noted that with the new codebase, the Cardano (ADA) system can be operated even on low-cost computational equipment with a poor Internet connection. This fact guarantees the unmatched level of decentralization in Shelley mainnet.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-releases-upgraded-byron-codebase-whats-new,utoday,2020-03-27,14:46:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptos This Week (Mar 29): CRO, XMR, XRP, ADA, XLM ","The coronavirus pandemic has only  worsened  this week and has engulfed almost the whole world. Several countries in Europe and the US have been the worst affected outside of China where the virus started. While the world attempts to tackle the spread of the virus by lockdowns, it is having a huge negative impact on the economy.  In order to support the economy, the US announced a stimulus package of  $2.2  trillion, which is the largest in history. Meanwhile, the Fed’s balance sheet continues to swell and has crossed  $5 trillion  in assets.  While these efforts are a great morale booster in the short-term, they are likely to result in a financial crisis down the road, which cannot be handled just by printing more money. As the investors realize this, they are likely to enter the crypto space, which can not be manipulated by the governments at will.   Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 A user poll of “VIP” crypto traders on Kraken shows that the traders expect Bitcoin ( BTC ) to hit an average price of  $22,866  by the end of this year. About half of the participants expect the SEC to approve a Bitcoin ETF this year. It is not only Bitcoin that traders are positive on, but about 50% of the respondents also forecast an altcoin season for 2020. Another bullish indicator is that the total number of wallets holding a whole Bitcoin has reached  800,000 . This is a positive sign as it shows that investors are using the current low prices to accumulate. Do the technicals of the top five performers of this week also show signs of accumulation? Let’s study the charts. CRO/USD Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) has made it to the list of top performers for the second consecutive week. This shows that bulls continue to favor the altcoin. Crypto.com added Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) to its Crypto Earn program, which will help investors earn up to  4%  p.a. on their deposits, paid in BCH. Similarly, Chainlink ( LINK ) and Tezos ( XTZ ) were added to soft staking, which will help investors earn up to 2% p.a. Along with giving handsome interest rates, the payments and cryptocurrency platform announced collaborations with three tax providers to assist its users in cryptocurrency tax  reporting . CRO USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The rebound from the recent lows of $0.0245 broke above the 20-week EMA at $0.045 but could not rise above the 50-week SMA at $0.049. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending the moving averages. Currently, the price has dipped back below the 20-week EMA, which shows selling at higher levels. The 20-week EMA has flattened out and the RSI is just below the midpoint. This suggests a consolidation for the next few days. The CRO/USD pair might remain stuck between $0.050 and $0.0245.  Our view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and plunges below the support at $0.0245. A breakdown of this level will be a huge negative as it will start a new downtrend. On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $0.050, a rally to $0.060 and above it to $0.080 is possible.  XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) was the second-best performer of the past seven days with a rally of about 13%. It has made a sharp  recovery  in the past few days and is now attempting to find a place among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. What does its chart suggest? Let’s find out. XMR USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The sharp selling on March 12 and 13 plunged the XMR/USD pair below the critical support of $38.83. While a drop to a multi-year low is a huge negative, we like the way the price quickly recovered from the lows of $25.3118. This shows strong buying at lower levels. After two weeks of failed attempts by the bears to resume the downtrend, the pair started a relief rally this week. The bulls pushed the price above the first overhead resistance of $44.50, which is a positive sign.  If the bulls can sustain the price above $44.50, the relief rally can extend to the 20-week EMA at $60.15 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $70.51. Therefore, the traders can turn positive if the price breaks above $52.  On the downside, we expect the bulls to provide strong support at $38. However, if this level cracks, a  retest of the recent low at $25.3118 is possible. XRP/USD XRP , with a rally of about 12%, turned out to be the third-best performer of the past seven days. This week saw two different groups of scammers targeting XRP users.  The research team “xrplorer forensics” claimed that a  fraudulent  Google Chrome extension has allegedly stolen about 1.4 million XRP from the users. In another  scam , a bogus YouTube account impersonating Brad Garlinghouse, CEO of Ripple, was seen promoting a fake giveaway. However, on a positive note, Ripple Labs announced a donation of $100,000 each to two non-profit organizations to aid the fight against coronavirus. XRP USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The XRP/USD pair has broken out of the descending channel, which is a positive sign. This signals a possible change in trend. Currently, the bears are attempting to stall the relief rally at the horizontal resistance of $0.17468. If successful, the pair might again dip towards the recent lows of $0.12750 and below it $0.1140. If the lows hold once again, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. However, if the bears sink the price to new lows, it will be a huge negative. On the other hand, if the bulls can sustain the price above $0.17468, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. The first level to watch out for is the 20-week EMA at $0.225 and if this is crossed, a move to $0.31503 is possible. The traders can wait for the pair to close (UTC time) above $0.17468 before turning positive. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) moved up by about 4% in the past seven days and took the fourth spot among the best performers. Cardano  launched  its off-chain scalability protocol, Ouroboros Hydra, which according to the company can “theoretically scale to a million transactions per second - comfortably in excess of current global payment systems such as VISA.”  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  criticized  Wikipedia for not allowing an article in the English language for Cardano, though several other major cryptocurrencies have one.  ADA USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The ADA/USD pair had been trading inside a large range of $0.03-$0.065 for the past few months. However, the recent sharp sell-off saw the price break below the range and dip to a low of $0.0176366. While a new multi-year low is a bearish sign, we like that the price did not stay near the lows for long. This shows that the bulls bought the dip instead of panicking and dumping their holdings. Currently, the bulls are attempting to push the price back above $0.030 but are struggling to sustain the price above it. This shows that the bears are unwilling to give up without a fight. The failure to sustain above $0.030 might attract another round of selling. If the next dip holds above the recent lows, we expect the pair to rise back above $0.030. If the price sustains above $0.030, a rally to $0.065 in the medium-term is possible. Though the 20-week EMA at $0.042 and the 50-week SMA at $0.053 might offer resistance, we expect them to be crossed. The traders can wait for the price to sustain above $0.030 before turning positive. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) was the fifth-best performer with a rally of just under 3%. Can the bulls carry the price higher or will the altcoin turn around and dip to new yearly lows? Let’s study its chart. XLM USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The XLM/USD pair is attempting to recover from its multi-year low of $0.026063. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They are aggressively defending the overhead resistance of $0.042133. If the price turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to start a new downtrend. A break below $0.026063 will be a huge negative. Conversely, if the pair climbs and sustains above $0.042133, it will signal that the recent breakdown was a bear trap. Above $0.042133, rising to the 20-week EMA at $0.056 and above it to the 50-week SMA at $0.075 is possible. The traders can wait for the price to sustain above $0.042133 before turning positive.

cardano,No Section,"Vitalik Buterin Wants to Rid Humanity of Aging, David Sønstebø and Justin Sun Join In","Ethereum’s  Vitalik Buterin , IOTA’s David Sønstebø and Tron’s Justin Sun are discussing anti-aging research and supporting it. Buterin admitted that this idea is weird for many people these days, though, he also called aging a humanitarian disaster. In the course of a recent discussion of ‘weird ideas on Twitter’, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin, suggested discussing anti-aging research, calling aging ‘a humanitarian disaster’. He stated that every two years, as many people die from aging as did in World War 2. Additionally, he said that the issue burdens social systems and families. Buterin hopes that soon scientists will be able to significantly extend the human life span. If we're being more open minded about accepting new weird ideas, can I suggest anti-aging research? Aging is a humanitarian disaster that kills as many people as WW2 every two years and even before killing debilitates people and burdens social systems and families. Let's end it. When asked about the planet getting overpopulated and the issue of the resources coming to an end, the Ethereum co-founder stated: “On average a new person contributes more to the resources available to existing humans than they deplete. (This is due to their productive labor, scientific research, the change they become the next Norman Borlaug, etc...)” “We are nowhere near any theoretical bounds on our ability to use those resources. Our efficiency in using limited resources has increased by orders of magnitude in the last two centuries, and can rise orders of magnitude more.” IOTA founder,  David Sønstebø , has responded, saying that in 2020 the discussion on life-extension measures should not at all be considered a weird idea, unlike it was fifteen years ago, in 2005. Now, Sønstebø tweeted, this should be ‘the universal common sense position’. Pretty odd how this is considered a weird idea in 2020. I remember it being considered 'far out' in 2005, but 15 years later and so many breakthroughs in that time, this should be the universal common sense position by now. The Tron founder Justin Sun briefly joined the discussion. Agree! ? In an exclusive interview with U.Today, the IOHK CEO and  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  also shared his take on the subject of anti-aging. While describing possible trends of the future, he mentioned a largely growing market of life extension products and services. He recalled the well-known example of a jellyfish that can regenerate and thus live forever. “So there's probably going to be a considerable amount of improvement in regenerative biology and an improvement in a human lifespan extension and new therapies and medicines to keep us healthy into our deep old age. So then what does that mean? It means you have a human race that doesn't recycle every 80 years. They may last a lot longer.” He also suggested that as the anti-aging trend likely gets wider and stronger, there will be fewer religious people accepting death as a natural part of human life.",https://u.today/vitalik-buterin-wants-to-rid-humanity-of-aging-david-sonstebo-and-justin-sun-join-in,utoday,2020-03-31,12:51:00,en
cardano, News ," Cardano's Byron Reboot Goes Live, Paving Way to Shelley Mainnet ","Proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain Cardano ( ADA )  went live  with its Byron reboot yesterday, March 30, as the project prepares its transition to the Shelley mainnet. Announced  by Cardano’s developer, the peer-to-peer technology firm Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the reboot involves a series of updates to major components of the Cardano network — the Cardano node, explorer, and Daedalus wallet backend, which is being spun out as a  new version , Daedalus Flight. A process, not an event In an outline of the reboot’s significance, which has taken 18 months to complete, IOHK explained that the new design is, “modular, separating the ledger, consensus, and network components of the node, allowing any one of them to be changed, tweaked, and upgraded without affecting the others.” In lieu of improving the existing code, the reboot was made by working “from scratch,” with all critical elements of the new Cardano node formally specified. Changes to the wallet’s backend and services have been grouped together as “Adrestia,” offering exchanges and third-party developers to use a collection of independent, self-contained libraries to interact with the Cardano network.  APIs have been extended and specifically designed with larger exchanges in mind, and Daedalus will now include Yoroi wallet support — thereby supporting features such as transaction filtering and parallel wallet restoration. A new rolling release of Daedalus will provide scope for users to test the new node functionality and wallet backend and offer their feedback to IOKH, which has pledged to implement improvements in response. Overall, IOHK claims the reboot will result in performance improvements and higher transaction throughput capacity — i.e. how much demand the network can manage in terms of transactions per second.  The developers are also eyeing a reduction in barriers to entry by making the Cardano node more efficient in terms of memory usage, thus enabling users with lower-spec hardware to participate in the network and helping to ensure greater levels of decentralization. IOHK describes the reboot as more of a process than a discrete event, noting that its “goal is to gradually and sustainably migrate the entire Cardano blockchain to working on the new node implementation, without any disruption or loss of service.” Following this process, IOHK plans to focus on the Haskett Shelley testnet, including the onboarding of stake pool operators to incentivize them to prepare for running on the future Shelley mainnet. Decentralization max As reported, IOHK was founded by the mathematician, cryptographer and entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson in 2015. Also a co-founder of Ethereum, Hoskinson told Cointelegraph in an  interview  this February that his aim is to make Cardano 50 to 100 times more decentralized than Bitcoin once all its upgrades are implemented.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardanos-byron-reboot-goes-live-paving-way-to-shelley-mainnet,cointelegraph,2020-04-01,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Interview with Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson: We Have the Best Product From Every Dimension,"In the second part of my  interview with the founder of Cardano , CEO of IOHK, and ex Ethereum co-founder, Charles Hoskinson, we discussed what projects, apart from Cardano, Charles finds the most noteworthy and what difficulties Cardano’s team has encountered while working on their big upgrades. U.Today: So, Charles, can you please tell us what the biggest challenge Cardano faces is? Charles Hoskinson:  The single biggest challenge we initially faced, which has been resolved, was, “how do you do scientific research in this space and turn science into engineering and actually bring it to the customer?” It's easy to just copy someone else's code. It's easy to just write some code and say it works. It's easy to write a white paper abstracted from reality and say, “Oh look, my beautiful protocol’s perfect.” But they actually don’t put all those pieces together and turn it into an end product that's built on evidence. No one actually has ever done that. We were the first company in this space to pursue this.  There have certainly been some attempts, like Algorand and Tezos and others who have a slightly more formal methodology, but we're dealing with it in every aspect of the product: the network stack; we designed our own programming languages; we designed our own consensus protocol; we designed our ledger rules; we designed a method to actually write those rules down. There's just so much stuff that's going into the development of Cardano that we kind of over-engineered things, in a certain respect.  The problem is that we're expected to bring this to market as quickly as Ethereum brings things to market, as quickly as other people bring things to market. We're building a Ferrari, but there’s market expectation of delivering a Toyota. So, the big challenge was managing expectations. The big challenge was trying to accelerate things that ordinarily do not accelerate well. But, for example, just the use of formal methods, there are several projects that do that. The braking systems on the trains use formal methods because you'd like to know that when the train tries to brake, it's gonna brake, otherwise everybody dies on the train. That's one of those things that just can't fail. There are examples of where things have not worked well. When software was bad, like for example, the Boeing 737 MAX, they didn't use formal methods at the construction of that system. So, it had some nascent bugs that crashed the plane.  There's consumer demand for this. But generally speaking, these systems take years to implement. So, we were saying, “Oh, we're going to do that, plus science, plus consumer engineering, and we're going to get this all done in around 24 months.” No one has ever done that before in any computer science project. So, that was the biggest single challenge, it was trying to figure out what the scope was going to be, how to put all these pieces together, how to execute quickly, especially with people who aren't used to executing quickly. Academics are not engineers. They're not accountable to two-week sprints. They have the luxury of taking a semester off or holiday and there's always next semester. So when we tried to put a commercial product into that kind of culture, that was a huge challenge for us as well.  card But, we've overcome those challenges in that respect. We've gotten to a point where we feel we have the best product from every dimension. We feel we have the fastest product, we have the most secure product, we feel we have a product that can be the most decentralized. We feel we have the product with the best smart contract model and asset issuance model that brings a lot of competitive things to the table. We feel we also are quickly getting to a point where we have the product that's easiest to list for exchanges, both as staking as a service and as just holding the asset.  Charles Hoskinson. Image via  @IOHK_Charles We also feel we have a product that's the most extensible, meaning that you can add things to it very rapidly and it works well. This is just a consequence of spending years of engineering effort, carefully thinking things through and simplifying things as much as possible. Despite the fact that we have all of this complexity on the science side, our actual implementation, the actual codebase is about half the size of Bitcoin’s. So, we're much more concise, things are more modular, they’re more simple, and as a consequence, they're much easier for people to work with and eventually understand. We paid a large, huge price on the front end, but now it's going to start paying dividends on the backend and in the foreseeable future.  U.Today: That's impressive! Apart from Cardano, what other projects can you single out in the market? Charles Hoskinson:  I have a lot of respect for Algorand because I know Silvio Micali personally and I think he's one of the best scientists in the history of cryptography. Algorand is a legitimately good protocol and there's some good science there with Vault, their programming language design. They have good engineers who were poached from MIT to go and do interesting things. So, that's an example of a project that's doing novel and interesting things.  There's actually a project in Russia led by Alex Chepurnoy. I think he's based in maybe St. Petersburg, I forget, but it's called Ergo and it's based on a framework called Scorex. That's a great piece of software. It doesn't get enough love. I think that the market cap is only a billion dollars, but it's actually one of the most innovative cryptocurrencies ever constructed. It has non-outsourceable puzzles. It's got Sigma protocols. Alex is a genius. He's one of the best programmers and designers in the entire cryptocurrency space and he's been here for eight years with very little praise or fanfare. He's much smarter than Vitalik and he should get credit for that. So, I love Ergo as a project. I think it's a great piece of software sadly underloved by the market.  card I have a lot of respect for Dash, especially given the things that they've done for governance, the fact that they've forged an entire community off of their central bank function and people can get paid to do things, whether it be making videos or writing code, that means that they always have a shot to be relevant. So, even if this year you don't like them, because they have perpetual funding, because they have a stable community, that means that they have money to get to next year, and then they have money to get to the next year. So they'll be around for a long time. If you have the ability just to indefinitely work on something, eventually you find a niche and you're able to execute and do well.  So, I have great admiration for all of the treasury coins that actually have a treasury function. Of course, I always respect Bitcoin. I started with Bitcoin. I've been in the space for eight years. It's been so much fun to watch Bitcoin evolve and grow from 50 cents when no one cared about it, when the hash rate would collapse 25% per day or go up 25% per day because people would turn off their computers for a night, to this massive global movement that has a huge brand name. Bitcoin can always get back in the game. Should they implement taproot, simplicity, side chains, Lightning and get all these things pulled together. It'd be actually quite a good system to build on in a very secure system. So it's fun to compete with them, both on the brand liquidity and on the technology side, and that community is extremely vigilant.  I do wish that maximalism would go away because if I say I admire Bitcoin, they say that I'm a scammer and I'm stealing money from people. So, that culture is kind of toxic and it prevents Bitcoin from ever growing to a critical mass. But, all those things aside, it never diminishes my admiration for what Bitcoin has done and the technology it has brought to the marketplace.

cardano, In depth , Proof-of-Stake Vs. Proof-of-Work: Which One Is ‘Fairer’? ,"This is the first of two articles providing a deeper dive into the eternal debate between the proof-of-stake and proof-of-work consensus algorithms. This part will focus on the basics, while also discussing the issue of wealth concentration and inequality, which is often at the center of any community argument. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and many of the original cryptocurrencies were born as pure proof-of-work systems.  Proof-of-stake was  first pioneered  in 2013 by Peercoin, a project that exists to this day.  Peercoin’s contribution to the popularity of PoS is likely dwarfed by Ethereum ( ETH ) and its goal to transition from PoW — which has turned out to be a  very long journey . Projects such as Cardano ( ADA ) avoided PoW entirely, deciding on PoS after using a formal approach to assess consensus mechanisms.  The Bitcoin and Monero ( XMR ) communities remain some of the staunchest proponents of mining and proof-of-work.  What is a consensus algorithm? In any blockchain, the consensus algorithm is designed to solve the issue of trust between the participants of a network. Used for payments, the consensus algorithm is the final piece in the complex cryptographic puzzle that makes cryptocurrency work.  Basic features of a transaction, such as ownership and amount, are easy to verify with the help of public-key cryptography, which works through fundamental mathematical properties. Consensus algorithms exist to mitigate the “double-spend” attack, where a malicious actor is able to spend the same coin twice (or any number of times). Solving this issue requires a deliberate decision on which of the two spends is valid. There are no pure-mathematical solutions to this problem. Instead, consensus algorithms use a combination of cryptography and economic incentives to maintain a functional network. Bitcoin’s consensus is based on a simple rule — the longest chain of blocks is the only valid one. The system was later termed  Nakamoto Consensus , in honor of Bitcoin’s anonymous founder.  In order to make the concept work, adding blocks to each chain must be relatively difficult. This is where proof-of-work and mining come in. Each block is secured through cryptographic techniques that require miners to commit computing power in order to add blocks.  As computing power is directly proportional to electricity usage, Bitcoin is secured directly by a fundamental physical quantity — energy. Under proof-of-stake, the network secures itself through the commitment of a stake — a certain amount of capital in the form of the network’s own tokens. Its security is meant to be derived directly from the perceived economic value of the network — how expensive it is to purchase a majority stake. But PoW networks also have a close correlation between economic value and security. Miners receive coins as a reward, which means that the higher the value of the coin, the more money they make.  New miners are incentivized to add more hardware and spend more energy to receive their share of the rewards — which increases security. Over time, the profit for each individual miner trends toward an economic equilibrium dictated by electricity prices.  As a consequence, the amount of electricity dedicated to mining depends on the coin’s emission rate and market capitalization, while it is largely decoupled from the network’s performance or activity. Many PoS proponents see this as the biggest issue of PoW.  The energy problem Cointelegraph spoke with Aggelos Kiayias, the chief scientist of IOHK, one of the entities behind Cardano, to learn more about their decision to use PoS. She said: “The costs and energy consumption aspects of Proof of Work blockchains were definitely a consideration. It seemed natural to think: ‘is it possible to get a protocol that has a similar type of profile with, for example, Bitcoin’s blockchain, but somehow doesn't have the same energy expenditure?’” The electricity consumption of Bitcoin mining is significant, with the latest  estimate  from July 2019 placing it at an annualized value of 70 terawatt-hours. This is close to the total electricity use of a  small European country  like Austria — although to put that in perspective, it is also just 0.28% of the global figure.  The environmental impact is contested, with a July 2019 report estimating that 74% of Bitcoin mining is done through  renewable sources . Proponents of PoW in Monero and  Bitcoin  often  argue  that the energy used in mining is not ""wasted,"" as it is necessary to ensure the resilience and decentralization of the consensus algorithm. Jake Yocom-Piatt, project lead for Decred, agrees with the environmental concerns but doesn't believe that PoS is necessarily the answer. Speaking with Cointelegraph, he said: “PoW is indeed environmentally unfriendly. However, it must be considered that it is the first and simplest consensus system proposed. There are surely ways to improve PoW in the future.” Though proof-of-stake also involves energy consumption for the delegation process, it is generally agreed to be far less energy-intensive than an equivalent proof-of-work solution. However, many argue that it compromises on too many things in order to achieve this. Trusting PoS history According to Yocom-Piatt, pure PoS is reversible, which means that its history can be changed. This is similar to an argument made in a  2015 paper  by Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Bitcoin development company Blockstream. Poelstra argued that it is impossible for a user to rely on the proofs-of-stake to claim that a particular block is valid — because that stake itself depends on previous stakes within that blockchain, which are ultimately based on nothing. He wrote: “Because there is no universal time (and to new users, no universal history), there is no way to differentiate users who are ‘now’ holding the currency from users who ‘were’ holding the currency.”  PoW history, by contrast, can be mathematically verified to be correct and can only be counterfeited by recreating its entire mining history. As noted by Poelstra, PoS proponents will argue that as long as short-term history can be secured, changes in old blocks will “contradict the history as remembered by participants of the system.” This, according to him, “changes the trust model from that of Bitcoin” to one where consensus relies on always-online peers. While he believes that this could theoretically work, he argues that such a trust model is “vulnerable to legal pressure, attacks on ‘trusted’ entities and network attacks” — that it’s less censorship-resistant and decentralized, in short.  PoS proponents  agree  that a certain aspect of extra-protocol social coordination and consensus is necessary to maintain its security, but they argue that PoW systems ultimately rely on social consensus as well. There is no clear winner in this line of argument. It is a philosophical debate that hinges on each individual’s opinion about whether actively relying on social consensus is an acceptable compromise to reduce electricity usage. It is perhaps for this reason that the debate has since moved into other contentious topics.  Acquiring stake vs. acquiring work Economic fairness is an often debated point for both types of consensus. In line with the principle of decentralization, both sides seek to minimize issues such as unfair access to the ecosystem or increasing wealth disparity. Proof-of-stake is often considered to be a system where “the rich get richer” due to the way it rewards the ownership of capital. In a  Reddit AMA , Ethereum Foundation representatives argued that the opposite is true: “In both bases, the owning of an asset allows for seeking gains on that asset. The difference between the two is that in PoS, the mapping of capital to gains is much more direct and fair (i.e. buy token, lock token, perform duties, gain X). Where in PoW, the mapping of capital to gains is highly dependent upon extra-protocol factors.” In the Cardano network, Kiayias emphasized that PoS makes no distinction between the “rich man’s dollar” and the “poor man’s dollar.” He explained: “Proof of Work systems, if you look at them, cannot give you a perfectly egalitarian version [of consensus] [...] Whereas in a Proof of Stake system, in principle, you could have a situation where one dollar in the pocket of the poor person would be equal in strength to a dollar in the pocket of a rich person.” The CEO of Equilibrium, a project designing an algorithmic stablecoin on EOS, also agreed with the Ethereum Foundation’s argument: “I totally support this assessment. Staking highly fungible tokens doesn't create any entry barriers and doesn't lead to any kind of disparity as long as the given tokens are accessible on the open market.” They share the opinion that mining increases wealth disparity due to the accumulation of “extra-protocol” factors. Bulk discounts, early or even exclusive access to new hardware — all of these make proof-of-work inherently unfair, according to many PoS proponents. Alejandro De La Torre, VP at Poolin, currently the largest Bitcoin mining pool, believes the exact opposite — that extra-protocol advantages make proof-of-work fair. Speaking with Cointelegraph, he said: “In my opinion, the possibility of creating a new chip, accelerating the OS of a mining rig, or literally any other discovery that gives you an advantage in PoW mining is essentially the reason why PoW is the fairer 'cryptoeconomic' protocol. [...] PoS only relies on having the core asset; and the more you have the more you make. There is no other way to improve your situation in PoS mining, barring of course just purchasing more of the underlying staked asset.” Equality of opportunity is what matters Cointelegraph also spoke with Campbell R. Harvey, a professor of international business at Duke University, to learn more about the concept of economic disparity and how it relates to consensus mechanisms. Summarizing his position on the wealth disparity gap in blockchain economics, he said: “Yes, one critique of PoS is that the rich get richer. In PoW, it is more of a business operation with the miners not needing to hold BTC, ETH, etc. In PoS, you need to hold.” Harvey argues that the two systems have different economic natures, focusing on the business operation aspect of PoW — where miners can have negative profit, get outcompeted or fail entirely. He explained: “I don’t think modern mining is an important factor for wealth distribution. Indeed, a large amount of mining becomes obsolete not because of age but because of fluctuations in BTC prices.” When asked whether bulk discounts contribute toward wealth disparity, he replied that it is a normal economic phenomenon called scale efficiency. Mining is “no different than any other industry” according to him. Harvey then explained that wealth inequality is generally expected in any free market system due to “differential natural endowment of skill” and luck. He continued: “We usually focus on inequality of opportunity rather than wealth. In a free market, anyone with a good idea should be able to make it to the top 1%.” From an opportunity standpoint, proof-of-stake systems are generally fair. Harvey pointed to the model of delegated proof-of-stake as an example, where “even small holders can participate in the miner rewards by delegating some of their stake.” Staking pools and delegation models are generally present in any PoS system though, and they could be implemented through extra-protocol measures as well — similar to PoW mining pools. But De La Torre argues that equality of opportunity applies to the ASIC mining industry as well. He explained: “Historically, machines last a good three or four years before they are made obsolete — break, difficulty too high, etc. [...] Like we are seeing now, with the ending of the mighty [Bitmain] S9 era, the entire cycle of the mining industry begins again. This cycle is the creation of new miners, new OS [operating systems], the sourcing of cheaper electricity around the globe. This cycle also brings in new participants that want to take advantage of PoW mining.” Mining is not always the same Kristy Leigh-Minehan, former chief technology officer of Genesis Mining and one of the creators of ProgPow, believes that many of the equality concerns against PoW are specifically related to ASIC mining. When using consumer hardware to mine, their wide availability diminishes many of the supposedly unfair competitive practices. She explained: “CPUs and GPUs have existing supply chains that are used to distribute to hundreds of thousands of individuals, every day, all over the world. So when you build a Proof of Work algorithm that takes advantage of that hardware, you're piggybacking on that supply chain and that distribution channel, instead of creating and inventing your own.” In her view, ensuring that “Alice and Bob have the same capability of earning a coin” is crucial in designing a proper PoW algorithm. She conceded that miners will always tend to specialize and optimize their operations, so the key is to ensure that miners compete fairly “on the CapEx side.” Capital expenditure, or CapEx, for ASICs can be reduced significantly for large players due to scale effects. On the other hand, GPUs and other consumer hardware are much cheaper and easier to source for average people, according to Minehan. The fundamental contribution of PoW Minehan is a strong believer in the contribution to network activity from GPU miners — especially early on. She emphasized that “humans don't want to spend their hard-earned fiat on magical internet money.” On the other hand, she believes contributing with already-owned computer power is a much more suitable proposition. In truth, the concept of an initial coin offering is, essentially, spending fiat on “magical internet money.” But this could not have happened by itself — it is the result of the groundwork laid by Bitcoin and Ethereum.  The former legitimized the entire concept of “magical internet money.” More than 17 months passed between the Bitcoin  genesis block  in January 2009 and the famous  Bitcoin pizza  transaction on May 22, 2010 — the first to give BTC a fiat value. Ethereum built on this by being one of the first ICOs in 2013, and proving that the concept can work. Distributing the initial Bitcoin would have been essentially impossible in a staking environment. It is only after the network is stabilized, Minehan argues, that the transition to staking can occur. Yocom-Piatt also highlighted PoW as a “high quality source of entropy” to ensure a fair distribution of tokens. Peercoin also relied on PoW for the initial distribution. The systems are different, not necessarily better or worse In conclusion, debates on the economic equality of proof-of-stake and proof-of-work are perhaps the wrong way to look about it, as Harvey suggested. It is difficult to conclude that one system centralizes wealth more than the other.  In most PoW systems, the miners can gain unfair advantages over others — but they can also fail and lose their entire investment through no fault of their own, something that is normally impossible in PoS systems. Yocom-Piatt, whose project is a hybrid, summarized that “pure PoS is substantially different from pure PoW.” He argues that hybridizing them allows Decred to benefit from the best of both worlds. The PoW side “works well as a means to gamify timestamping” and thus ensure immutability, but PoS is still needed to align incentives for governance. Yocom-Piatt believes that miners’ interests are not as strongly aligned with the cryptocurrency as for stakers, which leads to “shortcomings in the context of governance.” Decred’s experience may suggest it is misguided to debate PoS in opposition to PoW. Combining both appears to shore up any perceived weaknesses that they may have individually — something that is not applicable to other blockchain debates, such as  Ethash versus ProgPow . But from a governance standpoint, the recent  exchange takeover  of Steem highlighted that those who control tokens are necessarily the owners of those tokens. The second part of this series will feature an in-depth examination of how governance works in PoS and PoW.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work-which-one-is-fairer,cointelegraph,2020-04-01,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Exclusive Interview: Charles Hoskinson Knows How to Find Satoshi Nakamoto,"Charles Hoskinson, the famous founder of Cardano, explains how people can find out who Satoshi Nakamoto is, and speaks on the future of our world, new religions and the possibility of immortality. Let’s dive into the third part of our exclusive interview! U.Today: John McAfee recently told me that he knows who Satoshi Nakamoto is, do you think that's possible? Do you have your own guesses who it could be? Charles Hoskinson:  Well, I'll tell you how to find out if you're really interested. So, what you can do is use stylometry. This is a term for the analysis of handwriting or analysis of writing. Code Stylometry is the analysis of actual source code. So, the original Bitcoin code was 100% written by Satoshi. What you can do is you can apply stylometric techniques to that code and apply it to all the open-source projects that have ever been written and there's a very high probability you're going to find a match between that code and other code and then transitively you can follow it. You probably can get a really good idea of who that person could be.  If you have to speculate on age range and speculate on skill sets, you're looking at somebody in their forties to fifties at the time of the publication Bitcoin. So, they’re now in their fifties or sixties, were educated in the 1980s or early nineties, and brought up in a very particular school of computer science. Bitcoin script, alone, gives you a lot of indication of where that person was trained because it was based on a language called Forth, which is a very uncommon language, but it was used mostly in computer science pedagogy, especially in England and in the Eastern United States during that time period. So, that's somebody who probably has an academic background. Somebody who has a lot of knowledge of cryptography, especially because of the choice of the elliptic curve and the fact that he was able to create things like Base 58 and things like that. It's clearly a person who had computer science training. The overly academic C++ code was a good indication of somebody trained to know how to code but not be a professional engineer. Cause there was a lot of cleaning and optimization and technical debt reduction that would have happened. And then Code Stylometry will probably give you a pretty good idea of the candidates for that.  card I've never done that exercise but I know people who have and they have a pretty good idea of who Satoshi is, given facts and circumstances. But it's never been an interest to me because, frankly, that person left the ecosystem and doesn't want to be doxed and Bitcoin has operated just fine since 2012. It's been eight years now and we haven't had any issues. So why do we need to bring the founder back? I think the power here is that certain people want to say they’re Satoshi or say they know Satoshi because it gives them a special prestige. It's almost like you're the Pope and you speak for God, right? You can then use that pulpit to influence people to use your product, like Bitcoin SV for example, or, at the very least, make yourself seem cooler or more interesting.  I mean, the reality is, as great as Satoshi’s contributions were to cryptocurrencies, just what we've done at IOHK is significantly more meaningful. We formalized everything from what a ledger is to showing that proof of work can be resistant to quantum computers. We solved the proof of stake problem. We designed significantly better programming languages. We extended the UTXO model, approved by simulation with a special type of state machine. I mean this is foundational work done by dozens of academics and the totality of it is unbelievably better than anything Satoshi can construct. At the peak, our system could probably perform at a million transactions per second. Satoshis’ can do it at seven. I mean, these are just facts. 
 
 So, as much as we venerate the founder and recognize the brilliance there, it’s important to understand that the space, as a whole, has moved on, from a scientific and technological viewpoint. It's important also to understand that that was just one person or a collection of people. And now there are millions of people in this industry. And the whole point of the vision was to say that no one was more special than anyone else. We're all equal and we all have the same voice. Get rid of the leaders, get rid of the centralization. So it'd be very counterproductive for a Satoshi to return to this space at this stage because it would just centralize a big chunk of the movement around an individual. The point is to get rid of those individuals and empower everybody at the edges. So, I have the most respect, not for the science, but the most respect for the fact that he knew when to leave and retire and get out of the way of his invention and allow that invention to grow to where it's grown to, and decentralize it naturally. U.Today: That’s very interesting. I never thought about it from that angle, you know. I've got only one question left and I’m really eager to hear your thoughts on it because it’s kind of your thing. What do you think the web will look like 50 years from now? Charles Hoskinson:  Actually, this exercise was done by Arthur C. Clarke. I believe, back in the 1950s, he was a science fiction writer and he got most of it right. He predicted the internet and a litany of other things. So, I guess you ask a science fiction writer if you want an accurate estimate. The challenge 50 years from now is that we see the seeds of a lot of very earth-shattering, earth-changing technologies being laid today that will be fully realized at that time period. It's incredibly hard to know how we're going to use those seeds. So the graphene revolution is right now underway and in 50 years graphene will be everywhere in every product. That means indestructible homes and batteries that last five times longer. There was a whole class of metamaterials as well, which means that sensors are becoming orders of magnitude cheaper. Everything from new types of solid-state radar to new types of optics. So, functionally, you're now talking about smart materials. Wireless power transmission is getting really good. It's something people are thinking about. So, all your surfaces will be potentially electrified. Battery-powered cars will become predominant within probably the next 20 years. So, in 50 years, there will be probably no internal combustion engines anymore. They'll be gone and you'll have cars that go 4,000 or 5,000 miles on a single charge. All those things will be there. Probably, battery-powered planes, also because of graphene, will be commonplace.  So, the backbone of our energy grid will probably be no fossil fuels and 100% alternative or nuclear fusion, probably combined with some fourth-generation nuclear plants which will have been built in the 2030s and 2040s. The smart materials will be so smart that everything will be VR and AR. Your glasses and surfaces will be able to just present information that's contextual. We're also seeing an enormous amount of growth in biotechnology and so there's a very strong possibility that implantable consumer-grade medical devices will become commonplace. For example, that company Neuralink, that Elon Musk funded. He created the first brain-computer interface. It's implantable. Within 10 years that's going to be consumer-grade. Within 50 years that'll be commonplace and highly competitive. which functionally means that human beings can just think and connect to computers and computers can go back to them. So, all those interfaces will be completely built. When you walk into a room, the room knows who we are and we can just think to control the room and all the surfaces will be smart surfaces and so you can see anything, hear anything, do anything. It also means that we'll change the way we communicate with each other. If we have brain-computer interfaces, we can think to each other. Telepathy can be something that could exist within a 50-year timeframe. So you just think to talk to somebody. Not just in the same room but, because of the internet, everywhere.  There's going to be huge innovations in physics. We have things like time crystals. Now we have things like quantum teleportation. These are theoretical constructs. We're going to continue seeing enormous advancements in them, especially in quantum cryptography. So, we'll have completely new ways of handling communication. What's really cool is communication without a medium. Right now, when you want to send a signal, it goes from point A to point B over a medium like air or wire. Well, you could technically just entangle things far away so you can't intercept messages anymore. It's pretty crazy stuff. A huge amount of advancements in quantum physics, but then also quantum computing as well, especially given that quantum computers can emulate a lot of these quantum physics so we can get a dramatically better understanding of how the universe works. Consumer-grade quantum computers are probably coming in 20-30 years. So all that stuff is going to be there. And then the thing about quantum computers is that that computing model allows us to think about problems that humanity has never been able to solve because they can't be solved within the lifespan of a human or the lifespan of the universe.  So all these, like NP complete style problems could somehow be reduced to polynomial time, meaning that you can now analyze gargantuan sets of data or find patterns we never thought were possible. So that means all kinds of new questions can be asked and all kinds of knowledge can be gained as a result of the quantum revolution. A corollary to that is that there's probably going to be the emergence of a semi-strong or strong AI within that timeframe because the economic incentives are so great to construct these things. So, a lot of people call this a singularity. Whatever connotations you want to put on it, it's likely going to occur within that timeframe in my view. And what that functionally means is that we, again, have a new realm of thinking that we didn't have before. And there's a very strong possibility that we will use these modes of thinking to tackle ethical problems, governance problems and resource allocation problems by collective consensus. What that functionally means is that we'll probably see new forms of government be created where we start dividing the things you can trust humans to do and the things historically humans are very bad at dealing with. For example, this quarantine response to this global pandemic. Imagine 50 years in the future, if you had a strong AI that had control over quarantine protocols. If we had this back in December it would have done all the models and realized that, naturally, we couldn't stop this, and ordered a global quarantine for all countries for a month. Then just by doing that, the coronavirus pandemic would have been over. We would have no more growth. Like in China where they did the most draconian of a shutdown, there are no domestic cases. All the new cases are imported. So had every country just shut down for a month and enforced a strict quarantine protocol and had proper governance for that, the entire virus would be gone. We wouldn't have to watch 20 million people die, economic calamity and so forth. It could have actually done things to mitigate the economic calamity like institute for that time period of universal basic income and make sure that certain supply chains were in place and so forth. You can't do that with human skill coordination, but you could do that with strong AI coordination. So, these tools will be in our tool bag and there'll be things that are definitely there.  We'll also see tremendous strides in life extension. There's a huge market for that. There’s a massive amount of funding going into that. And we're getting a deeper understanding of why things age. Nature tells you everything. There are, actually, creatures that live forever. For example, there's a breed of jellyfish that every time it gets old, it'll just form, assist, regenerate itself and become young again. So they technically are biologically immortal. They kind of just float around like trash bags, but they’re immortal jellyfish. And so you think about that and you say, “Okay, well what does that mean”? It means that if we can kind of master those techniques, we can port them to humans. So, there's probably going to be a considerable amount of improvement in regenerative biology and an improvement in human lifespan extension and new therapies and medicines to keep us healthy into our deep old age. So then, what does that mean? It means you have a human race that doesn't recycle every 80 years. They may last a lot longer. So there's probably going to be a higher priority put on sustainability and a higher priority, socially speaking, put on wisdom and so forth.  We see a huge surge of secularism occurring. The religiosity of people is diminishing and that's probably going to be a trend that continues. So, there's going to be far fewer Christians and Muslims and religious Jews and so forth in the 2060s, or the 2070s, as there are today. What will likely happen is new religions will be formed. You kind of already see the seeds of that. For example, the singularity movement. Yuval Harari feels that it is a religion. I think he's right. They have a savior. The strong AI is coming. It will make peace on earth and solve all of our problems and people believe in it, not even with scientific basis. They just have blind faith that progress will get us there. There was another religion called Dataism, saying all data should be free and open. So, there are these full new philosophies and concepts that exist and they will continue to percolate and change humanity's outlook and perspective and will allow us to deal with the problems of the time. In the past, three things that really dragged humanity down were war, famine and disease. So, most religions were constructed to allow us to address those problems. Now, moving into the 21st century, we're going to live in a time of unlimited plenty. We will grow more food than we need at some point. We'll cure the diseases that tend to kill us. And war is really becoming a thing of the past. We still have them, but they're not like World War Two, where the whole globe falls into conflict, they're more like a superpower goes and beats up on a small group of rebels or something like that. Or a small nation-state gets taken over by a larger nation-state. So, we might still have large conflicts, but they're more unlikely because of the weapons that we have today.  What does that mean? It means that the religions we constructed to deal with those problems are no longer relevant or necessary. So, in the 2060s and 2070s, there'll be religions that deal with the consequences of a lack of meaning in life, consequences of overabundance and the consequences of living a lot longer. Also, they will deal with the consequences of social relationships being a bit weird, considering we have internet and telepathy and all these other cool things going on. So, the way you interact and think about people will be fundamentally different. Those are going to be new social challenges that priors constructs were incapable of dealing with. So it's going to be a pretty interesting time. And that's just a small sample of the things that I think are going to come in the next 50 years. U.Today: This was incredibly interesting and, now I know much more about what's happening in that realm. Thanks so much. Thank you for your time.  Charles Hoskinson:  Thank you for having me. I really appreciate it.

cardano, News , Cardano Foundation Endorses South African Blockchain Alliance Establishment To Boost Adoption ,"The Cardano Foundation praised the establishment of the South African National Blockchain Alliance (SANBA) on April 7. The cooperation endeavors to explore further ways to strengthen technology’s adoption throughout South Africa. According to the official  announcement , Cardano Foundation praises the use of blockchain technology to boost socio-economic growth in South Africa. The Foundation believes such an establishment will help them to achieve their goal of increasing blockchain adoption across the region. South Africa as the key market for African blockchain awareness Cardano Foundation cites the South Africa market as pivotal to building a network across the country that is made up of governments, institutions, and companies that currently use its technology. From the announcement: “Cardano believes in empowering individuals and enterprises by putting them in direct control of their information, wealth and value. Blockchain technology lets developing nations break ties with legacy banking systems, costly middlemen and entrenched political structures.” On other fronts, Cardano Foundation believes that the possible applications of blockchain technology would let them guarantee greater transparency, reduce fraud, build digital identity infrastructure and boost developing economies through virtual currencies. The Foundation also stated that it hopes to help other countries on the continent to boost their own fintech efforts. Importantly, COVID-19 isn’t slowing Cardano Foundation development efforts. The news of this partnership comes after Cointelegraph  reported  on March 25 that Cardano launched an off-chain scalability protocol called Ouroboros Hydra after building it up over five years. launched an off-chain scalability protocol called Ouroboros Hydra after building it up over five years.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-partners-with-south-african-blockchain-alliance-to-boost-adoption,cointelegraph,2020-04-09,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson Reveals His 9 Favorite Crypto Projects ,"Cointelegraph recently sat down for an interview with Charles Hoskinson, who is the co-founder of Ethereum and CEO and founder of IOHK — the company developing Cardano. During that interview, Hoskinson shared details about some of the crypto projects that he is most interested in. Ergo “It's one of the most revolutionary cryptocurrencies ever built. Got so many crazy ideas like non-outsourceable puzzles and sigma protocols and pruning the blockchain and roller chains. All this crazy stuff. Even has a proof of no premine.” Ergo was founded by Hoskinson’s “favorite technologist”, Alex Chepurnoy, who also contributed to the development of Cardano. It is a PoW blockchain platform with Turing complete smart contracts that employs a number of advanced features like zero-knowledge proofs, ring signatures, oracles, and adjustable block size. ZCash “They've advanced the entire discussion of zero knowledge cryptography. We've borrowed some of their stuff. We've innovated on some of the things.” … “They’re carrying the banner of privacy and the banner of inclusive accountability, and both of these things are incredibly important as a core.” Zcash is a privacy coin that allows for both transparent and private transactions. Hoskinson has a lot of respect for ZCash and their work with zero knowledge proofs. StarkWare “Those are wonderful people and they're incredibly smart people. And again, they're allowing us to do amazing things with scale.” Hoskinson likes the fact that StarkWare’s development also helps Cardano to improve its scalability. The company was co-founded by  Eli Ben Sasson , who was one of Zcash’s founding scientists. Its goal is to  enable  on-chain scalability through the usage of zero-knowledge proofs. Lightning Labs “I have a lot of respect for Lightning Labs. <...> And that's a good solution, if not for scalability, for interoperability between cryptocurrencies. And they seem to be easy enough to talk to, to collaborate with, and fairly open people, good people.” The company is building second layer solutions for the Bitcoin network. Their mission is to offer users a way to send and receive money more efficiently than ever before. Hoskinson noted that he approves of Elizabeth Stark’s specification-driven approach to development. Dash “I have a lot of respect for the Dash community. I think they were one of the first to really prove out a cryptocurrency treasury and show the power of a treasury. And they even sponsored research at Arizona State University with it.” Dash is another project on Hoskinson’s list that is focused on privacy. It employs two layer consensus — with master nodes sitting on top of the proof-of-work base layer. Hoskinson believes that Dash proved “the power of a treasury”. He also has an appreciation for Dash’s community. Tezos “I don't really like their community too much because they're so toxic and negative towards us and they just never seem to let an opportunity kick us when we're down, escape. But overall, I do have a lot of respect for at least the philosophy and the technology that they've been deploying.” Tezos is a proof of stake blockchain with on-chain governance. Tezos was created to provide the safety and code correctness required for assets and other high value use cases. Hoskinson praises Tezos, despite its community’s perceived toxicity towards Cardano. Algorand “... they are another one of the science coins and we all kind of support each other. Even though we get academically competitive, we're able to reference each other's work and learn from each other and grow from each other.” Algorand is another proof-of-stake blockchain that was founded by Turing-award recipient, Silvio Micali. It’s main goal is to create a transparent system in which all users can achieve success via decentralization. Avalanche “I think Avalanche has some merit as well, especially in the IoT [Internet of Things] space in Ava is going to be an interesting coin that comes out. And there's a lot of interesting ideas there.” Founded by another preeminent scholar, Cornell professor Emin Gün Sirer, Avalanche promises scalability and operability. Hoskinson is optimistic about Avalanche’s coin, which pays for fees and provides the basic unit of account between the multiple blockchains deployed on the larger AVA network. Basic Attention Token “... the growth curve and the adoption of BATs has been just phenomenal. And I think they're poised on a five or 10 years to become a major player in the very least displaced Firefox completely and potentially even have a meaningful share of the browser market, which could translate to billions of dollars of advertising revenue that's not connected to, you know, the cartels that exist and allow people to avoid being deplatformed.” Brave browser rewards users for watching advertisements by distributing Basic Attention Tokens. Brave was founded by Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript and founder of the Mozilla project. Hoskinson believes that BAT has the potential to disrupt the “cartels” that control online advertising. It is not surprising that Hoskinson, who is building Cardano with a research-first ethos and who studied number theory in school, has picked quite a few projects that both share his philosophies and focus on privacy.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskison-reveals-his-9-favorite-crypto-projects,cointelegraph,2020-04-15,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson: 'Ethereum Moves at The Speed of Vitalik' ,"Cointelegraph recently  sat  down for an interview with  Ethereum  ( ETH ) co-founder and  Cardano  ( ADA ) founder  Charles Hoskinson . During the interview, he discussed his criticism of the development of the Ethereum platform. “His first project” Hoskinson believes that one of the main reasons why Ethereum’s development has struggled is that too much hinges on  Vitalik Buterin  personally: “So, basically Ethereum moves at the speed of Vitalik. So if he knows how to do something very well and he's become very competent in something, they have a handle on it. But when you're talking about research, when you're talking about actually delivering a product to market, these are things that require experience.” According to Hoskinson, it shows that Ethereum is Vitalik’s first major project: “He's never done any of this before. This is his first company, his first project. He was never a researcher, was never a CEO.” Managing expectations Another major criticism that Cardano founder has for Ethereum is the fact that their project development roadmaps are too optimistic, which leads to unrealistic expectations: “I think that the marketing of Ethereum, I think that the culture of Ethereum was not so good at managing expectations and things that are going to take 5, 10, 20 years, whether they be decentralizing the Web, creating a new token economy, scalability of these things are very difficult and each and every one of them requires a lot of very hard work, both on the scientific side and on the engineering side. And there's just this raw belief that exists within the Ethereum community that somehow it's all going to work its way out and it's going to be done in a matter of months or years as opposed to decades.” Why bother with PoW? Hoskinson suggested that there may be some also disingenuity involved in the way project is marketed: “Why was there such a big fight about ProgPow? Why were they even trying to change the proof of work algorithm if they're switching to proof-of-stake? Why would you even bother? Because you're going to get rid of proof-of-work, right?” At the same time, Hoskinson emphasized that he has a lot of respect for Buterin personally: “I think you're right that Vitalik is a good guy. I've never once questioned his ethics. I've never once questioned his integrity or his belief in his product or his ecosystem.” Despite all the criticism, Hoskinson still sees Ethereum as a major competitor: “I think they're going to be around and I still think they're going to be relevant and a strong competitor.” In the next article based on the Hoskinson’s interview, we will reveal what early acquisition could have propelled Ethereum forward.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-ethereum-moves-at-the-speed-of-vitalik,cointelegraph,2020-04-17,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson: Ethereum Would Be Better if Buterin Used 'Snow White' ,"In a recent  interview  with Cointelegraph, Ethereum co-founder and Cardano ( ADA ) founder  Charles Hoskinson  discussed a potential early acquisition that could have made a world of difference for Ethereum. According to Hoskinson, had Vitalik Buterin applied the Snow White Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus developed by Elaine Shi, it would have greatly expedited the development of Ethereum 2.0: “My biggest problem is that he hasn't divided and conquered. Like, for example, the development of Casper — with Casper, Vitalik could have gone to Cornell and went to Elaine Shi. She wrote a great protocol, called 'Snow White,' it’s a competitor of our 'Ouroboros' [Cardano PoS consensus]. And back in 2016, Elaine Shi came up with this, so he could have very easily gone there and said, 'Here is a $5 million grant, go develop Casper.'"" Elaine Shi is a professor at Cornell University, one of the most advanced blockchain hubs in the United States. In 2016, she  co-authored  a paper on Snow White PoS consensus which “provides the first formal, end-to-end proof of a Proof-of-Stake system in a truly decentralized, open-participation network.” Nodes can join at any time, even after the system is created. According to Hoskinson, this would address the “limited academic rigor” he says was prevalent with Ethereum’s development. Buterin could have had top scientists who were deeply interested in the problem create a beautiful consensus algorithm for him, Hoskinson said, leaving him free to focus on developing the rest of the business and technology. However, Hoskinson said Buterin had other ideas: “Now he wanted to develop Casper himself, which meant he divided his time between being a CEO and being an engineer and being a scientist. And he tried to go and develop something that he had no native experience in, and had to learn the whole theory himself, even if he's a genius. It takes time.” Whether or not you agree with Hoskinson’s assessment, he claims to practice what he preaches: “Contrast that with Cardano, where we brought scientists together and we follow the peer review process, and we systematically wrote paper after paper, and those papers went through peer review and we slowly built up the entire theory of Proof-of-Stake to a point where we felt comfortable and then we started talking about it.” Hoskinson concluded that improving on the strong foundation instead of developing something new from scratch could have saved Ethereum a lot of time and effort, and prevented the chronic delays that have plagued the project.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-ethereum-would-be-better-if-buterin-used-snow-white,cointelegraph,2020-04-21,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson Explains How Cardano Could Get to a Trillion Dollar Market Cap ,"In a recent interview with Cointelegraph ,  Ethereum  ( ETH ) co-founder and  Cardano  ( ADA ) founder  Charles Hoskinson  explained why he believes Cardano is poised for a trillion dollar market cap. One of the main distinguishing points of Cardano’s development approach is its emphasis on research-first. Genius founder will not always be around Though there have recently been a new crop of what Hoskinson calls “ science coins ” — such as  Algorand  ( ALGO ),  AVA , and  StarkWare  — when Cardano was starting out, this approach was radically unorthodox. To this day, the approach often attracts criticism for being too academically pedantic and slow. However, Hoskinson believes that it will allow Cardano to shine in the future: “So my whole argument for academic rigour is it's not just about today, it's about tomorrow in two different respects. It's about tomorrow from the respect that we can get protocols that can scale to billions of users. And there are no protocols in the world that right now allow us to do that. So they have to be designed. And then two, who will come up with the protocols five years from now, 10 years from 15 years from now? Are we always going to have the genius founder around? No.” Scaling to billion users In order to make sure that the project can function and grow even without its “genius” founder, a project needs to create “a decentralized brain” that will enable perpetual innovation: “So when quantum computers come alive, we have defenses against that. When we start doing these things on satellites, we have protocols for that. Well, we want these things to work on a cell phone with the same user experience and use recursive snarks. <...> And it doesn't have to be built by one company or one party. It can come out of the academic world in a very decentralized way. <...> So I think this is the long term superior approach and it's the only approach that will actually get us to the protocol of a billion people.” Getting to trillion dollar cap Hoskinson believes it is just a matter of time before the crypto industry will grow from billions to trillions. One key driver of this growth is demographics: “First key point here is that everybody under the age of 35. If you take a cross-section of them, statistically speaking from McKinsey and these other people are more likely to own a cryptocurrency than own a bond, a stock or gold. So investor interest in this asset class is biased towards [the] young. And as the young get older, they get richer.” Furthermore, Hoskinson expects governments to start adopting blockchain technology and at the same time, provide clearer regulation: “Eventually, states will run their voting systems. Eventually states where their property registration, all these things. So the fact that those systems exist and they're doing all these things creates more inflow of value. And third, the regulations are getting set that institutional investors can finally put money into our industry, which brings billions of dollars of new investment.” And when all of these factors align, Hoskinson believes that Cardano will be positioned to benefit the most: “And I think we are best positioned to capture the largest chunk long term. Now, whether that happens in five years, 10 years, 15 years, a whole bunch of things could occur to accelerate or put the brakes on our entire movement.” Many in the crypto community agree that the crypto industry could eventually grow to the trillion dollar range, but only time will tell whether Cardano will be the main beneficiary of such a spurt.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-explains-how-cardano-could-get-to-a-trillion-dollar-market-cap,cointelegraph,2020-04-23,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Cardano, Cosmos and Tezos Beat Bitcoin and Ether in Latest Weiss Crypto Ratings ","In the latest figures released by financial rating agency Weiss Crypto Ratings this week, Cardano ( ADA ), Tezos ( XTZ ), Cosmos ( ATOM ) and Fantom ( FTM ) are the top coins by in the “technology” category, ranking above Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ).  Released weekly, the rating compares cryptocurrency coins in a number of categories including adoption, risk/reward and technology. The list  currently rates  123 coins and tokens with the highest overall rank only hitting a B+. The risk/reward column does not give any coin a rank above D.  Rating system The Weiss Crypto Ratings model is built with five basic layers that take data from the project’s technology, adoption, risk and momentum. These layers then filter the information through in-house software models identifying each component in relation to the potential success or failure of the overall company. In part, their success is claimed by their ability to remain impartial and objective through the fact that they receive no incentive or compensation from any of the cryptocurrencies. How the top projects are traveling XTZ, ADA, and ATOM are currently  ranked  10th, 13th, and 23rd respectively by market capitalization. Tezos has shown  strong gains  in 2020 with the current price of $2.68 almost double the price coming into this year. Previously the team was in the headlines due to legal battles and internal fighting. Cardano just released its V1.0.0 Daedelus update with other milestones expected to be hit throughout the year.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: XLM, ADA, BTC, BCH, HT ","The most talked-about event last week was the West Texas Intermediate crude futures for May delivery, which plunged to negative  $37.63  per barrel on April 20. That was followed by a sharp rebound, which helped crude oil recover to $17.31 by the end of the week. Crude oil’s  volatility  surpassed that of Bitcoin ( BTC ) in mid-March and has only climbed higher since then. Several energy traders are likely to have suffered huge losses due to the roller coaster ride in oil.  Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 While Bitcoin is likely to hog the limelight this week, a few altcoins have also formed bullish patterns. This suggests that if Bitcoin prices remain strong, these altcoins could also move higher. So, let’s look at the top five bullish setups that could offer short-term trading opportunities this week. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) rallied and closed (UTC time) above the overhead resistance of $0.053194 on April 22, which completed a bullish ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a target objective of $0.076388. XLM-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Usually, when the price breaks out of a bullish setup, it tends to return and retest the breakout level. However, in some cases, the momentum is so strong that the price only consolidates for a few days and then resumes its up move. Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is trading in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.  The XLM/USD pair has also been consolidating above the immediate psychological support of $0.060 for the past two days. This indicates that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect higher levels in the next few days.  XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The sharp rise from close to $0.050 to $0.066102 shows a flagpole formation. Following the sharp up move, the XLM/USD pair has made a pennant, which usually acts as a  continuation pattern.  A strong breakout of the pennant signals the possible resumption of the up move. The bulls broke above the pennant but are struggling to hold on to the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels. Therefore, the traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above $0.063327 before buying. The initial stop loss can be kept at $0.060. As the price moves northwards, the stops can be trailed higher to reduce the risk and protect the paper profits. The bears might aggressively defend the overhead resistance at $0.066102 but if this level is crossed, the move can extend to $0.073 and then to $0.078. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) broke above the double top that was forming at $0.0369205 on April 23. This attracted buyers and the altcoin rallied to the next overhead resistance at $0.0437998 on April 24.  ADA-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview After a day of consolidation on April 25, when the ADA/USD pair formed an inside day candlestick pattern, the bulls have broken above the resistance of $0.0437998. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight as they are mounting stiff resistance at higher levels.   With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the overbought zone, the advantage is with the bulls. If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.0437998, it could result in a rally to $0.052 and then to $0.061 in the next few days. ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows a flagpole that formed after the pair broke above $0.0369205. That was followed by a pennant formation as the bears defended the overhead resistance at $0.0437998. However, today, the bulls have broken above the pennant and have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $0.0437998. Therefore, the bulls can buy at the current levels with an initial stop loss at $0.0412, which can be trailed higher as the pair moves up. The first target to watch on the upside is $0.0504 where partial profits can be booked. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.04192.  BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been leading the recovery from the front. With the halving approaching, the leading cryptocurrency is likely to remain in focus next week. On April 23, the bulls broke above the critical resistance of $7,454.17. BTC-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, the BTC/USD pair has not been able to pick up momentum as the bears are aggressively selling on any rise. But the positive thing is that the bulls have been maintaining the price above the breakout level of $7,454.17, which indicates strength. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has broken above the 60 mark for the first time since mid-Feb., which shows that bulls have the upper hand. The next level to watch on the upside is the $8,000-$8,146.84 resistance zone. BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Bitcoin had been trading in a tight range of about $7,605-$7,435 for the past few days. Attempts to break above or below the price range did not sustain. Even today, the bulls broke above the range but the price has again slipped back into it. This shows aggressive selling by the bears at higher levels.  Along with the range, a pennant formation can also be seen on the charts. The bulls purchased the dip below the pennant today, which suggests strong buying at lower levels. If the bulls can push the price above the pennant, the up move is likely to resume. The target objective of this breakout is $8,393.25. Therefore, the bulls can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the pennant. The initial stop loss can be kept at $7,380, which can be trailed higher after the pair moves above $7,740.37. If the bulls struggle to break above $8,000, the stops can be tightened further. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around and breaks below $7,435.47. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) has largely been range-bound between $200 and $250 for more than a month. The lone attempt to push the price above the range on April 6 turned around from $280.47 on April 08. BCH-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview When the price consolidates for a long time, it usually culminates with a strong breakout. In this case, if the bulls can propel the price above $250, the BCH/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $300. On the other hand, if the pair again turns down from $250, the range-bound action could extend for a few more days. The trend will turn negative on a break below $200 as it will complete a bearish head and shoulders pattern, which could result in a retest of the recent lows at $141.11. BCH-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Though the pair is stuck in a trend, the traders can spot an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $250. Therefore, the traders can buy on a close above $250 and keep a stop loss at $225. The bulls might face a stiff resistance at $280.47, hence, the traders can tighten the stops closer to this level. However, if this level is crossed, the up move can reach $300 and then $320. If the price turns down from the current levels, the traders might get another buying opportunity near the trendline of the ascending channel. However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, long positions can be avoided. HT/USD Huobi Token ( HT ) has recovered sharply from its recent lows of $1.18361, which shows strong demand at lower levels. For the past few days, $4.05 has been acting as a stiff overhead resistance.  HT-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, both moving averages have been gradually moving higher and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The HT/USD pair has also formed a bullish ascending triangle pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $4.05. The pattern target of this setup is $4.58. If this level is crossed, the up move can extend to $4.80. Conversely, the failure to sustain the price above $4.05 will keep the pair inside the triangle for a few more days. HT-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The bulls broke above the overhead resistance of $4.05 today but they have not been able to sustain the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels. However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sink below the support at $3.90. This suggests demand at lower levels. The bulls are again likely to attempt a breakout above $4.05. If the pair can close (UTC time) above $4.05, the ascending triangle pattern will complete and a rally to $4.58 is possible. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $4.05 and keep a stop loss of $3.80. The bears might attempt to stall the rally in the $4.15-$4.20 resistance zone. If the traders find that the bulls are struggling to push the price above this zone, the stops can be tightened to reduce the risk.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's (ADA) Charles Hoskinson Teases Haskell Shelley Testnet Next Week: Details,"Charles Hoskinson, CEO and co-founder of the IOHK blockchain studio behind the Cardano (ADA) platform, announced the next stage of testing for the ultimately decentralized Shelley era. Mr. Hoskinson announced that the Cardano (ADA) blockchain will achieve a major milestone next week. Its mechanism will enter the stage of 'friends & family' testing. According to the leader of Cardano (ADA), this process of testing within the Haskell Shelley testnet will bring 'a lot of fun'. Next week is going to be a lot of fun. F&F Haskell Shelley Testnet! At this velocity, the public testnet won't be far off and then the pledge, saturation and desirability debate begins with the stakepool operators hammering it out with Kevin and Co. Shelley...smells like victory Mr. Hoskinson also revealed the next steps towards the long-awaited decentralization of the network. After the closed testnet, Cardano (ADA) will be open for public testing. Once public, the testnet will prove the stability of network operations and staking pools will start to accept ADA from stakers. It looks like the Cardano (ADA) Shelley Mainnet release is fast approaching since Mr. Hoskinson already believes that 'Shelley' smells like victory.   It is worth noting that on March 15, 2020, Charles Hoskinson dismissed rumors about delays with the Cardano (ADA) Shelley mainnet due to the ongoing market situation. He even asked some crypto media outlets to delete such  statements : This is fake news. Take the article down now   According to numerous estimations, the launch of Shelley will be a very meaningful event not for the Cardano (ADA) blockchain itself, but for the cryptocurrency industry as a whole. A previously reported by U.Today, this release is being seen as a 'new perspective' by Weiss Crypto Rankings. Only the Ethereum (ETH) 2.0 roll-out can compare with Shelley Mainnet in terms of the most highly anticipated releases of 2020 in the blockchain world. The Shelley era will turn the Cardano (ADA) 'federated blockchain' into a fully decentralized system. According to the project team, Cardano (ADA) will  demonstrate  'more advanced features than any protocol yet developed'. At press time, Cardano (ADA) is on the verge of breaking into the Top-10 blockchains by market cap with the ADA price up 3.6% at $0.051.",https://u.today/cardanos-ada-charles-hoskinson-teases-haskell-shelley-testnet-next-week-details,utoday,2020-05-08,12:37:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, ETH, XTZ, ADA, NEO ","Bitcoin ( BTC ) rallied above $10,000 on May 7 and just when everyone was getting ready for the long-anticipated halving surge the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap plunged over  15%  to hit a low of $8,130.58. However, the sharp fall in price did not attract further selling, which suggests that traders are not panicking and dumping their positions. This indicates that the sentiment is to continue buying on the dips. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 When Bitcoin plummets, it drags most cryptocurrencies along with it, but it is also important to remember that several major cryptocurrencies have been in an uptrend for the past few weeks. Corrections in an uptrend offer a buying opportunity to the traders who had missed the bus earlier. With the Bitcoin halving less than two days away, volatility is likely to remain high. Therefore, in the next few days, traders might consider reducing their position size to keep their risk under control. Let’s see which five major cryptocurrencies offer attractive trading opportunities in the short-term. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke above $9,200 on May 7 and hit a high of $10,058.52 on the same day. However, the $10,000 level proved to be a tough hurdle to cross. BTC-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview After a minor correction on May 8 and 9, the BTC/USD pair plummeted on Saturday evening. The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the previous resistance turned support at $9,200 could have led to selling by the bulls and initiation of short positions by the bears. The pair is currently trading inside an ascending channel where the price moves between the support line and the resistance line of the channel. $10,000 was close to the resistance line of the channel and from there the pair fell to $8,130.58, which is just above the support line of the channel. The strong bounce off this level, as seen from a long tail on the downside, is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls did not panic but used the drop to the support line of the channel to buy. As long as the price remains inside the channel, the trend remains up and strong declines to the support line of the channel can be purchased. The first sign of weakness will be a drop below the channel. If that happens, long positions should be avoided until a new buy setup forms once again. BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the price dropped sharply within a short time frame (shown via the blue arrow on the chart). If the traders watch the 30-minute chart, they can see that the pair dropped from $9,566.52 to $8,130.58 within 30 minutes. Such a fall usually suggests liquidation by a large player. However, a positive is that the price recovered sharply from $8,130.58 and since then has been trading above the $8,500 levels. The recovery might face stiff resistance between $8,960.97 and $9,156.94, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of this leg of the fall. If the pair bounces off $8,500, it could be a good entry point for the traders with a stop-loss placed just below the channel. The target objective on the upside is $9,600 and then $10,000. Conversely, if the next drop breaks below $8,500, traders can wait for the price to bounce off the support line of the channel, which can offer another buying opportunity with stops placed just below the channel. If the bears sink the price below the channel, it will be a huge negative as it will signal a possible change in trend. Therefore, bottom fishing should be avoided if the pair sustains below the channel. ETH/USD Although Ether ( ETH ) broke above the resistance line of the ascending channel on April 29 and 30, the bulls failed to sustain the higher levels. That resulted in a correction, which found support at the 20-day simple moving average ($204) on May 7. ETH-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, today, the  2nd-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turned down sharply and plunged below both moving averages and the support line of the ascending channel. Due to this, the 10-day exponential moving average ($203) has turned down marginally and the relative strength index has slipped into the negative territory. This suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. The price should sustain below the channel to confirm a change in trend. Currently, the price has bounced off the support line of the ascending channel, which is a positive sign. This suggests that the bulls view the dips as a buying opportunity. The pair is likely to pick up momentum on a break above the downtrend line. ETH-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The ETH/USD pair is attempting to reverse direction from the support line of the ascending channel. However, the bears are defending the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the decline, which is at $193.946. If the price turns down and plummets below $181.40, it will signal weakness and could result in a decline to $167 and below it to $150. Therefore, traders can initiate short positions below $181 with stops placed just above $194. Conversely, if the price turns up from the support line of the channel, it will signal buying on dips. Therefore, the bulls can buy the bounce off the channel with the stops placed at $181. If the bulls push the price above $197.821-$201.696 resistance, a rally to the downtrend line is possible. As the markets are volatile, traders should keep trailing their stops higher to reduce their risk. XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the trend is up. However, the bears have been aggressively defending the $3 levels for the past few days. Although the bulls broke above this level on April 29 and 30, they could not build up on the breakout. XTZ-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview On May 9, the  10th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turned around from just below $3 levels. The selling intensified today as the price slipped below the strong support of $2.55. Although the bears broke below the support line of the channel, they could not sustain the price below the channel. The long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are aggressively defending the support line of the channel. The 10-day EMA ($2.72) has turned flat and the RSI has dipped to just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears. If the bulls can keep the price above $2.55, it could offer a buying opportunity. XTZ-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The XTZ/USD pair is likely to face resistance in the $2.6015-$2.0686 zone, which corresponds to the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent leg of the fall. If the price turns down from this resistance zone, a fall to $2.50 and below it to the support line of the channel is possible. The bulls are likely to defend this zone aggressively. If the price bounces off the zone, it could offer a buying opportunity to the traders. The stops for this trade can be kept just below $2.20. On the upside, a rally to $2.70 and then to $3 is possible. The traders can trail the stops higher as the price moves up. This bullish view will be invalidated if the next dip breaks below the support line of the channel and sustains below $2.240. If this level cracks, long positions can be avoided until a new buy setup forms. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) has been facing stiff resistance at the overhead resistance at $0.0522712 while the bulls have been buying the dips to the support at $0.0468137. This tight range trading suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. ADA-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The  13th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap plunged to a low of $0.0427299 today but the sharp recovery from the lows shows aggressive buying by the bulls. If the bulls can sustain the price above $0.0468137, it could offer a buying opportunity. Conversely, if the price again slips back below $0.0468137, it will signal weakness. Below this level, a retest of $0.0427299 is possible. If this support also cracks, a deeper correction will be on the cards. ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour of the ADA/USD pair shows that the price is stuck in a $0.0543484-$0.0461143 range. Though the price dipped below this range, the bulls could not sustain the lower levels. This resulted in a sharp pullback, which shows strong buying on dips. However, the recovery is facing resistance in the $0.0477515-$0.0489368 zone, which corresponds to 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent fall. If the bulls buy the next fall to the $0.0468137-$0.0461143 support zone, it will indicate demand at lower levels. Therefore, traders can buy the bounce off this zone with a target objective of $0.053. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $0.0461143. If that happens, a deeper fall is likely, hence, traders can avoid bottom fishing below this level until a new buy setup forms. NEO/USD NEO  has been trading inside the ascending channel for the past few weeks. Though the bulls broke above the resistance line of the channel on May 8, they could not sustain the breakout. NEO-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview As a result, the  20th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap again dipped back into the channel. However, with both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls. Today, the bulls purchased the dip to the 10-day EMA ($9.8), which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to enter long positions. The trend will remain positive as long as the price remains inside the channel. The first sign of weakness will be if the bears sink the price into the bottom half of the channel. A break below the support line of the channel will signal a change in trend. NEO-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the resistance line of the channel attracted profit booking. That dragged the price to just below the centerline of the channel. However, strong buying close to $9.64 levels has pushed the NEO/USD pair back into the top half of the channel. This is a positive sign. If the bulls can scale the price above $10.50, a rally to the resistance line of the channel at $11.30 is possible Therefore, traders can buy at $10.50 with a stop-loss below $9.60. On the other hand, if the pair dips below $9.63378, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A bounce of this level can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity. In this case, the stop-loss can be kept just below the channel because if the price sustains below the channel, a deeper correction is likely.

cardano,Policy,"Industry Group Led by Polychain, Coinbase Seeks to Get Ahead on Staking Regulations","The Proof of Stake Alliance (POSA), an industry advocacy group, is publishing a series of recommended standards for companies participating in a proof-of-stake consensus protocol in an effort to reduce regulatory clampdowns on different networks. The group met with members of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) earlier this year to discuss their proposals and discuss staking more broadly, as well as submit a white paper detailing the industry recommendations. The alliance includes Bison Trails, Coinbase, Polychain, Tezos and the Cardano Foundation, among others. “We’re coming out with some industry-driven solutions around staking as a service which we believe will really help push the ecosystem forward and ensure that staking as a service and staking can grow in the U.S. without being subject to some regulatory landmines and hurdle,” said Evan Weiss, the group’s founder. Weiss, who is also chief of staff at Bison Trails, said the idea is entities that stake networks can be seen as service or infrastructure providers, rather than financial product providers. The recommendations shared with the SEC are essentially: Don’t provide investment advice to market participants Don’t call staking rewards “a profit opportunity” Focus advertising on network participation and security Don’t indicate the service provider has control over inflation rate Don’t provide guarantees on staking rewards “I do think [with] these networks, we are very clearly seeing that the technology underlying them is very powerful and I see it having an impact, maybe not in the next few months but in the next year or two,” Weiss said. The group used Tezos and Cosmos as two examples of proof-of-stake networks that are already live, he said, with questions focusing on how they work. See also:  Coinbase Custody to Support Polkadot Staking With up to 20% Returns Polkadot and NuCypher are another set of networks that haven’t quite launched yet, but which the group hopes to use as examples. “As they start launching we’re hoping to continue engaging with the SEC,” Weiss said. “They want to be smart on this which makes total sense and in my view they’ve been super reasonable about this. Network, not tokens Weiss said the group wanted to focus strictly on the operation of a proof-of-stake network, and not necessarily on the tokens that might be built on them.  “I think we really hope it looks more at looking at the providers as security and infrastructure providers, not financial providers,” he said. The group wants to remain small and focused on a single issue rather than field questions about whether a given token is a security, he said, adding the alliance would be willing to collaborate with some of the other trade associations in the space as needed to address these types of questions. “There’s been a lot of amazing work done by the [Chamber of Digital Commerce], the Blockchain Association so for us being a smaller [group] … I don't’ think we’ll be taking the lead here,” he said. The question of how proof-of-stake networks fit into regulatory regimes is still a broad one. Right now the group is focused on advocacy efforts within the U.S., but Weiss hopes any solutions that fit the U.S. framework will be applicable outside the country as well. “We’ve kind of taken this approach of being very detailed and so we’ve had a few times that we’ve been really focused on,” he said. “Our thinking is if we can get this right in the U.S. it can work [elsewhere] through ripple effects.” See also:  Kyber to Offer Delegated Token Staking After Coming Network Upgrade What the group needs now is buy-in from industry stakeholders and for conversations with the regulators to continue, he said.  He also wants to avoid a situation where entities are promoting tokens or a potential repeat of the 2017 initial coin offering market, which in his view “was not a great allocation of resources.” “A lot of people were hurt by it, so it’s finding a line between people who are really true technologists and making sure the people in the new economy, new interactions have a way to do that,” he said.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/05/14/industry-group-led-by-polychain-coinbase-seeks-to-get-ahead-on-staking-regulations/,coindesk,2020-05-14,13:24:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: ETH, XLM, ADA, XMR, CRO ","The coronavirus pandemic has  crippled  the United States’ economy, which is staring at its worst recession since the Second World War. To counter this, the U.S. Federal Reserve has  pumped  trillions of dollars into the economy. These measures are may result in hyperinflation in the future. Therefore, investors are buying gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) to hedge their portfolios. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 The  top-ranked cryptocurrency  by market capitalization has generated  increased  participation from institutional investors, according to numbers reported by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Contrary to the expectations of a few analysts, BTC has remained strong post-halving and is  attempting to break  above the psychological resistance of $10,000. If successful, it is likely to pull several altcoins higher. Let’s look at the top five cryptocurrencies that could offer trading opportunities this week. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) is trading inside the ascending channel, which suggests that the trend is up. The bulls have pushed the price above the downtrend line, which had been acting as stiff resistance for the past few days. ETH-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview This suggests that the bulls have overpowered the bears and the uptrend is likely to resume. If the  second-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap sustains above the downtrend line, a rally to $227.097 is possible. A break above $227.097 could result in a rally to the resistance line of the ascending channel at about $240. Although the 20-day exponential moving average is still flat, the relative strength index has broken out of the downtrend line, which suggests that bulls are at a slight advantage. However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the downtrend line, the bears will attempt to sink it below the support line of the channel. If successful, it will signal weakness. On a break below the channel, a drop to $176.103 is likely. ETH-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview After consolidating near the downtrend line, the bulls have made a decisive breakout, which is a positive sign. The 20-EMA is sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand in the short-term. Therefore, traders can buy at the current levels and on any retest of the downtrend line. The stop-loss can be kept at $196 and the target objective on the upside is $227.097. At this level, partial profits can be booked and the stops on the rest of the position can be trailed higher. On the other hand, if the bears mount a stiff resistance at $215-$220 resistance, the stops can be trailed higher to breakeven to reduce the risk. The short-term trend will turn weak if the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and sustains below the downtrend line. XLM/USD Although Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) dipped below the 20-day EMA ($0.067) on May 10 and 11, the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. This suggests strong demand at lower levels. XLM-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the bulls are attempting to drive the  11th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap above the downtrend line. If successful, the uptrend is likely to resume and a move to $0.076994 and then to $0.088311 is possible. The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls are at an advantage. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA. If this support cracks, a drop to the uptrend line and below it to the recent lows at $0.06 is possible. XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview After turning down from the downtrend line on two occasions, the bulls have finally managed to propel the price above it. This is a positive sign that could result in a rally to the $0.075-$0.076994 resistance zone. Therefore, traders can buy after the pair sustains above the downtrend line for 4-hours. The stop-loss for this trade can be kept below the recent lows at $0.066. The failure of the bulls to sustain the price above the downtrend line will indicate a lack of demand at higher levels. A break below the downtrend line can drag the XLM/USD pair to the uptrend line. If the pair bounces off the uptrend line, it might again offer a low-risk buying opportunity with a close stop-loss kept just below $0.060. If this level breaks, the trend could reverse downward. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) is currently consolidating in an uptrend. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen above the 60 levels, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. ADA-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview For the past four days, the  12th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has been consolidating near the downtrend line. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are not closing their positions as they expect higher prices in the next few days. If the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, the uptrend is likely to resume. There is a minor resistance at $0.0543484, above which the up-move is likely to pick up momentum. The critical levels to watch on the upside are $0.062 and then $0.072. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($0.048). Below this level, a retest of $0.0427288 is possible.  ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The ADA/USD pair has roughly been trading between $0.050 and $0.052 for the past few days. A breakout of the downtrend line can result in a move to the overhead resistance at $0.0543484. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively. However, if the bulls can propel the price above $0.0543484, the pair is likely to pick up momentum. The short-term target level to watch on the upside is $0.0615-$0.063. Therefore, the bulls can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.0543484. The initial stop-loss can be kept at $0.049, which can be trailed higher as the pair moves up. As the pair nears the target levels, the stops can be tightened further to protect the paper profits. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) is in an uptrend. The bulls purchased the drop below the 20-day EMA ($62) on two occasions. This suggests demand at lower levels. For the past four days, the price has been trading above the 20-day EMA and near the overhead resistance zone of $66.1545-$68.4175. XMR-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview A tight consolidation near the resistance increases the possibility of a breakout. The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone also suggest that bulls have the upper hand. If the  14th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap breaks above the resistance zone, it is likely to pick up momentum and rally towards its next target objective of $82.3912, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the recent down leg. Conversely, if the price again reverses direction from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will indicate weakness. The bears are likely to have a firm grip if the price dips below the recent lows of $54.0463. XMR-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows an inverse head and shoulders formation, which will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the neckline. This setup has a target objective of $78. Therefore, traders can buy 50% of the desired allocation on a close above the neckline and keep an initial stop-loss of $62. The bears might again offer stiff resistance at $68.4175 but if the bulls can drive the price above it, the XMR/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum. Therefore, the remaining 50% of the position can be added if the price sustains above $68.5 for four hours. If the bulls struggle to clear the minor resistance zone of $70-$72, partial profits can be booked and the stops can be trailed higher. The pair will weaken if it turns down and plummets below $62. CRO/USD Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) is an uptrend. The bulls purchased the dip below the 20-day EMA ($0.06) on May 10 aggressively. This suggests strong demand at lower levels. CRO-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has been trading above the 60 levels, which suggests that bulls are in command. If the bulls can propel the  15th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap above $0.0692, the uptrend is likely to resume. There is a minor resistance at $0.0736, above which the momentum is likely to pick up. The first target to watch on the upside is $0.0787 and then $0.0816. This bullish view will be negated on a break below $0.062. CRO-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are attempting to retest the recent highs at $0.0692. The bears might defend this level aggressively but if the bulls can keep the CRO/USD pair above the uptrend line, the possibility of a breakout of $0.0692 increases. Therefore, the bulls can initiate long positions on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.0692. The initial stop-loss can be placed at $0.061, which can be trailed higher as the price moves northwards. Conversely, if the price turns down from $0.0692, it can dip to the uptrend line. A strong bounce off the uptrend line will signal strength and can offer a low-risk buying opportunity. However, if the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line and the recent lows at $0.062, the short-term bullish trend may be at risk.

cardano, News , Cardano Development Company to Join Hyperledger Project & W3C ,"IOHK, the company charged with the development of  Cardano  ( ADA ) will be joining the  Hyperledger Project  and W3C. Cardano founder and CEO and co-founder of IOHK,  Charles Hoskinson, in a recent Cointelegraph interview , confirmed that the company will be joining the two organizations. Will help with bidding process Hoskinson believes that IOHK will benefit from their shared knowledge. He also feels that the partnership will give it an edge in the bidding process: “We would like to start consolidating some of our enterprise ledger ideas and bring it there, “A”,  because there’s just a lot of knowledge in that circle. And “B”, it helps us with the bidding process. When we're deploying a permissioned system, government procurement and corporate procurements, a little bit more familiar with Hyperledger.” Hyperledger is an umbrella for various  enterprise-focused blockchain protocols , founded by the Linux Foundation. The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is an international community that works on the development of Web standards. Enterprise version of Cardano part of IOHK’s bid IOHK’s contract with the Cardano Foundation is expiring at the end of the year, when the company will present its proposal for the contract renewal to the community. An integral part of this proposal will be the roadmap for creating an enterprise version of Cardano: “One of the things that we will explore is how do we create an enterprise version of Cardano? And we'll make a proposal for that at the end of the year when we're proposing to the community IOHK contract renewal for the next five years for Cardano. And there's going to be certainly an enterprise component to that renewal. And we'd love to pursue that strategy through the Hyperledger group at the Linux Foundation.” Hoskinson also emphasized that Cardano’s design allows for an easy switch between a permissionless mode and a permissioned one: “The way that we design Cardano, we made it very easy to switch between a permissionless and a permissioned mode.” There has recently been a trend in the growth of various  blockchain alliances and associations  led by  Libra and Celo .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-development-company-to-join-hyperledger-project-w3c,cointelegraph,2020-05-20,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Why Cardano Founder Chose Wyoming Over the ‘Giant Egos’ at Harvard ,"Cardano  founder Charles Hoskinson has revealed why the University of Wyoming presented a more attractive choice than Harvard, MIT or Cornell for Input Output’s (IOHK’s) lab. IOHK, the company charged with the development of Cardano,  donated $500,000 in ADA to the blockchain lab  at the university earlier this year. The State of Wyoming is known for its  progressive crypto legislation , which allowed former Wall Street executive Caitlin Long to establish the  first crypto-native bank in the U.S.   Hoskinson noted that the university was, “the first state institution in the entire United States to treat ADA like U.S. dollars.” Gender studies and egos According to Hoskinson, working with an “up and coming university” provides a better return on investment, with the entire donation being spent on blockchain related initiatives, rather than extraneous projects: “It's very easy for people to go to Cornell or MIT or Harvard. And they have giant egos. And when you do business with them, they price those egos and talents accordingly. So, sometimes for every dollar you put in, you get like, 60 percent that goes to other stuff, like journalism or gender studies or whatever.” From $500K to $1.3M  The state and the university contributed funds to the project as well — extending financing to $1.3 million: “So we put half a million dollars in ADA and they [Wyoming] matched it with half a million U.S. dollars. So then this university sweetened the pot a little bit. So for a $500,000 investment/donation, we were able to get a $1.3 million grant.” There are three main components to the lab’s activities: software development, pilots, and research on a new crypto-native microchip. The blockchain courses offered at the school focus on Cardano, so the students will graduate as Cardano-native developers. WIth cattle ranching being one of the state’s oldest and biggest industries, one of the first pilots  tracked free-range cattle . Blockchain politics There are also plans to  pilot blockchain voting  and identity in Wyoming, which could eventually roll out nationally: “It's going to be a place where a lot of blockchain pilots are going to come, for example, in the next 24 to 36 months. I think it would be quite easy for us to do. Voting pilots for voter registration and primary voting for both the Republican and Democrat Party in the state are done with a blockchain voting system.” All of these projects are long-term and will go through numerous iterations before reaching their goals, but this is what Hoskison believes will, eventually,  make crypto a multi-trillion dollar industry .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-cardano-founder-chose-wyoming-over-the-giant-egos-at-harvard,cointelegraph,2020-05-20,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano is Working on a Microchip That Would Give Crypto a Cash-like Experience ,"In a recent  Cointelegraph interview,  Charles Hoskinson elaborated on the crypto-native chip that IOHK is working at its  blockchain lab at the University of Wyoming  that may lead to many groundbreaking use cases, including a cash-like experience for cryptocurrency. Crypto-native microchip It all began when IOHK, the company charged with the development of  Cardano  ( ADA ), began exploring  supply chain use cases  and realized that there were no chips on the market that could satisfy its requirements — embeddability, ability to store cryptographic keys, and being inexpensive to produce: “Really what we noticed is that there's unfortunately no market standard right now for open-source trusted hardware that's sufficiently powerful that it could be used with cryptocurrency, but also could be used in the supply chain.” Hoskinson stressed that all the work being done on the chip will remain open source and will not only benefit Cardano alone, but rather the entire crypto community. When Lambo on chain? The chip could be used in a variety of supply chain use cases, including the authentication and management of luxury goods. For instance, it could be used to determine authenticity of Louis Vuitton handbags or for managing access to limited edition Lamborghini purchases: “And the only people who are allowed to buy those [limited edition models] are verified Lamborghini customers. And so you see a lot of these things. And so what ends up happening is people who are a verified customer, there's a lottery system and if they win, they have the right to buy it. But almost always they actually sell that right to somebody else and they make a profit. So it's like free money that Lamborghini gives their customers.” From crypto to physical cash However, not all of the use cases for the chip involve prohibitively expensive items. Many involve agriculture and the developing world. One of the most far reaching projects would involve, at first glance, a counterintuitive transformation — from virtual currency to physical currency: “You know, the whole point of Bitcoin was to go from cash to something that's like cash online. But what if you want to go in the opposite direction? What if you wanted to go from a native cryptocurrency to something that has a cache like user experience? It's very difficult to do without a hardware component.” Cardano believes that the developing world is one of the key markets for the future success of cryptocurrency. For instance, they discovered that in Africa only 2% percent of the six million farmers own smartphones: “So when you look at that, you say, well, OK, 98 percent are mostly offline and not banked or digital. So if I was building a money system for them, it would probably be a bad idea to say, ‘oh, you have to use an always online, purely digital currency.’ You need some other thing. And so how do I replicate the cash money experience but still have a blockchain backend? Well, what you do is you create a hierarchy where those two percent basically become like micro banks and then they can manage the issuance of these tokens to people and then their local phones or infrastructure can verify.” Infinitely scalable crypto The way this would work is that the private key from one chip would be transferred to another. It would also provide the proof of erasure, making sure that the key only exists on the new device. The chip could be embedded into a phone case and would not require the internet for transferring of cryptographic keys: “So if you can do that, you can basically just tap phones locally with no Internet connection to each other and move value. Like you would a twenty dollar bill from one actor to another actor, and you've replicated the cash experience. Now, what's nice about the solution is it's infinitely scalable because these transactions actually don't occur on the blockchain. So from the blockchain perspective, nothing has happened.” This is a long-term project that will take years to perfect. One of the concerns for Hoskinson is the shadow of the  trade war between the U.S. and China , which could cut into the chip production supply lines. In addition, cryptography is considered to be a weapons system and governments limit its export. Although they may overlook it during the halcyon period, these controls tend to tighten up in times of strife.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-is-working-on-a-microchip-that-would-give-crypto-a-cash-like-experience,cointelegraph,2020-05-21,00:00:00,en

As of now, 14 tokens can be bought with a single click of the mouse, including XRP and the exchange’s native  Binance Coin (BNB) .  
 
Even though the feature is available around the globe except for China, Iran, Morocco, and some other countries.   
 
 As reported by U.Today, Binance.U.S opened its doors for customers in mid-September 2019. The launch of  the new exchange  came after its parent company had to banish all American users due to regulatory hurdles. 
 
The trading platform initially debuted with only six coins and anemic trading volumes, but it started to actively expand the list of available assets.  On Sep. 25, 2019, Binance U.S. opened trading for Cardano (ADA) and 0x (ZRX) along with three other altcoins.   For those who need to make larger trades (more than $10,000), Binance.US launched an over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk earlier this month. It allows deep-pocketed customers to exchange crypto directly without relying on an order-book to match their buy and sell orders. 
 
By venturing into OTC trading, Binance.US followed the suit of other major cryptocurrency firms such as Circle  and Coinbase . ",https://u.today/binanceus-users-can-now-buy-cardano-ada-and-0x-zrx-in-seconds-with-visa-card,utoday,2020-05-22,16:30:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, XTZ, ADA, LINK, ETC ","The institutional interest in Bitcoin ( BTC ) has  increased  in the past few months, according to data from Grayscale Bitcoin Trust. If the trend continues at the same pace, by March 2021, GBTC would have purchased 75% of the newly mined Bitcoin during the period. By that time, its total holding of the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap would increase to 3% of the total circulating supply. If this happens, it could be a huge sentiment booster for investors who believe institutional investment is the key for mass adoption. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian has said that he holds a  percentage  of his wealth in crypto and he does not want to change it. Ohanian believes that Bitcoin is a hedge due to the fact that several “OGs of Wall Street” have now entered the crypto space.  The long-term fundamentals for cryptocurrencies have been improving but the price is yet to catch up. Can the up move resume this week? Let’s study the charts of five major cryptocurrencies that could offer trading opportunities this week. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows that the medium-term trend is up. However, the short-term has stalled as the price has dipped below both moving averages. BTC-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The BTC/USD pair has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. The 10-day exponential moving average is sloping gradually and the relative strength index is just above the 50 levels, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. While the best way to trade a symmetrical triangle is to wait for the price to breakout or breakdown from it, another possible strategy is to buy close to the support line of the triangle as this helps in keeping a close stop-loss. If the bears sink the price below the support line of the triangle, it will be a first sign that the uptrend might be in danger. A break below the channel will confirm a change in trend. However, the end of an uptrend does not mean a downtrend has started as the prices might remain range-bound. The downtrend might start on a break below $8,130.58. BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are aggressively buying the dip to the support line of the symmetrical triangle. This is a positive sign as it confirms demand at lower levels. The bulls might now attempt to carry the price to the resistance line of the triangle, which is close to $9,850. This is the first target objective. A break above $9,350 could indicate the resumption of the up move. This can offer a buying opportunity to the traders with a stop-loss of $8,950, which is just below the support line of the triangle. As the pair moves up, the stops can be trailed higher. Traders can book partial profits close to $9,850 and give some wiggle room to the remaining position because a breakout of the triangle will give it a pattern target of $11,778.  XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) has been trading inside an ascending channel, which shows the path of least resistance to the upside. However, the bulls have been facing stiff resistance at the downtrend line.  XTZ-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview This suggests that the bears are attempting to change the trend. If the  10th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels and plunges below the support line of the channel, it will signal a change in trend. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it could signal the resumption of the uptrend. The 10-day EMA has been gradually sloping up and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests that bulls have a slight advantage. Above the downtrend line, a rally to $3.0603 is likely. If the momentum can carry the price above this level, the uptrend can reach the resistance line of the channel, close to $3.60 in the medium-term. XTZ-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line. However a minor positive is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past two days (marked via ellipse on the chart).  If the bulls can drive the XTZ/USD pair above the downtrend line, the momentum is likely to pick up. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the downtrend line.  The first target objective on the upside is $3.06. Although there is a minor resistance at $2.963, this is likely to be crossed. On the downside, traders can keep a stop-loss at $2.65. As the price moves up, the stops can be trailed higher. A break above $3.06 can result in a rally to $3.20. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) continues to be in an uptrend. The altcoin resumed its up move following a breakout of the recent highs at $0.0543484 on May 19. However, the sharp drop on May 21 dragged the price back below the breakout level.   ADA-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview   The bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-day simple moving average on May 22 and pushed the price back above $0.0543484. This move suggested strong demand at lower levels. Currently, the  11th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has again dropped below the critical level at $0.0543484. However, the positive sign is that the bulls are attempting to defend the 10-day EMA.  If the price bounces off the current levels, the bulls are likely to make one more attempt to scale the price above $0.057555. If successful, the uptrend is likely to continue. The first target on the upside is a rally to the resistance line of the channel.  On the other hand, if the bears sink the price back below $0.050, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A break below the channel will indicate a change in trend. The bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the bulls might be losing momentum.  ADA-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview   The failure of the bulls to carry the price higher has attracted profit booking. As a result, the ADA/USD pair has again broken below $0.0543484. If the price sustains below this level, a drop to $0.0504050 is likely. Conversely, if the pair turns around from the current levels and climbs back above $0.0543484, the bulls will again try to scale the price above $0.057555. Aggressive traders can buy 50% of the desired position above the downtrend line and the rest above $0.057555.  The target objective of this trade is a rally to the $0.0615-$0.063 resistance zone. This trade can be protected on the downside by keeping the stop-loss below $0.053. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has largely been range-bound for the past few days. Both the moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between demand and supply. LINK-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview On May 21, the bulls attempted to resume the uptrend but they could not scale the price above the critical resistance at $4.2129. The bears again aggressively defended this resistance on May 22. Currently, the  12th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has formed a symmetrical triangle. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the triangle will resume the up move that has a target objective of $4.9127. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the triangle, a drop to $3.4602-$3.2865 support zone is possible. A break below the zone could result in a drop to $3.0473 which is the pattern target of the breakdown from the triangle. LINK-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows a symmetrical triangle formation. Although this setup largely works as a continuation pattern, it sometimes can also act as a reversal pattern. Therefore, it is best to wait for a breakout of the triangle before buying. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the triangle will be the first sign that the bulls have overpowered the bears. Traders can wait for the LINK/USD pair to breakout above $4.2129 before initiating long positions. The stop-loss for the trade can be kept below $3.7292 because if the bears sink the price below this level, a drop to $3.4602 is possible. Traders can avoid buying if the pair sustains below the triangle. ETC/USD Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) is currently consolidating inside a symmetrical triangle. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is just above the 50 level, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. ETC-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, the balance will shift in favor of the bulls if they can push and close (UTC time) the price above the resistance line of the triangle. Above the triangle, the first target to watch out for is $7.62717 and then $8.4117.  Conversely, if the  19th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A breakdown of this support will signal the start of a new downtrend. ETC-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Today, the bulls had pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. However, they could not sustain the price above the triangle, which suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. Currently, the ETC/USD pair has again dipped back into the triangle but the 10-EMA is acting as a support. If the pair turns around from the current levels and rallies above $6.80, the up move is likely to resume.  Therefore, traders can buy above $6.80 and keep a stop-loss at $6.38. If the bears sink the pair below $6.38, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A break below the triangle could start a new downtrend.

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson: Blockstream Founder Adam Back 'Checks All The Boxes' as Satoshi ,"In a  recent Cointelgraph interview , Ethereum co-founder and Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinon  said that he believes that  Adam Back  “checks all the boxes” as a  Satoshi Nakamoto  candidate. The puzzle of Satoshi’s true identity never seems to get old. Although Hoskinson admits that he does not have any hard evidence connecting the Blockstream’s founder to the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator,  he did make a mental profile of Satoshi  — Back seemingly has a perfect fit. Hoskinson believes that Satoshi was somebody, who lived either in Western Europe of the coastal United States, was comfortable with British English, and had a background in a distributed systems and cryptography: “And then given some of the quirks in the Bitcoin code, like the use of Forth, for example, as the basis for the Bitcoin scripting language, it indicates an English education or Western European education, because that's just what the textbooks were using in the 1980s and 1990s and these things. So when you start adding all these things up, as well as an intimate familiarity of the cypherpunk movement. So they had to be a contemporary of Hal Finney, a contemporary of guys like David Chaum and so forth and aware of their work.” Back kept on working from Hashcash to Bitcoin And according to Hoskinson, Back is one of the few people who satisfies these conditions. Back created a proof of work with Hashcash while he was at Microsoft, and furthermore had the knowledge to create a secure alias like “Satoshi Nakamoto”: “These are just great examples of what you would expect from the inventor of a proto-system that's almost Bitcoin, to kind of keep doing that research. The other thing is that Back is an expert in cryptography and he has a lot of experience in privacy. So you say, OK, who would have enough operational security knowledge to create an alias that's very secure and capable of defending against? That would be Back. Back was friends with Hal Finney, they knew each other for a long time. The very second person to enter the Bitcoin space.” Hoskinson’s assessment notably diverges from that of  blockchain co-inventor Scott Stornetta . Stornetta believes that a  few hundred people had the qualifications to build Bitcoin . Some prescient choices in Bitcoin Hoskinson also observed some inconsistencies in Back’s recounting of his relationship with Satoshi: “There's been some changing stories there. First he said he ignored Satoshi, and then I guess he had some emails with him. Like, OK, again, is it important? No… If it is Adam Back, I suspect on his deathbed he'll let the world know.” Furthermore, Hoskinson said that some of Satoshi’s decisions in  Bitcoin ’s ( BTC ) design were well ahead of the curve: “There were some extremely prescient choices of system level parameters that only became known after a lot of academic rigorous review. Like the difficulty readjustment target. Turns out that that was set above a theoretical threshold.” Satoshi has some unfinished business at Blockstream Hoskinson further postulates that the Bitcoin creator was intimately familiar with Hashcash, and the choices made by Satoshi were brilliant: “The choice of the elliptic curve was also really curious, secp256k1 is not a standard curve at the time that Bitcoin came out. But it turned out to be a very good choice of a curve. And it turned out to be a curve that was built on very solid foundations. So you had to at least understand a lot about elliptic curve cryptography to know that that would be a reasonable choice.” The design of proof-of-work would indicate that this person had been thinking about proof-of-work as a concept for quite some time, so they had to have significant familiarity with Hashcash as a mechanism. Hoskinson also believes it would make sense for Satoshi to be working at a company like  Blockstream , because Blockstream would appear to be trying to remedy some of the problems with the original Bitcoin code: “What's really curious is that it seems like there's been some attempts at Blockstream to repair the damage in the Bitcoin scripting language as unfinished business. In fact, there was a paper called Simplicity that they wrote, where they're actually revising and trying to redesign the Bitcoin script in a way that is a little bit better. So it feels like one of those things that if I was the creator of the system, I, of course, would come back and try to fix it later on.” At the same time, Hoskinson still believes that the only way to prove that  Adam Back is Satoshi is through the code stylometry , by comparing the code that Back had written before Bitcoin. Fortunately, plenty of  Back’s previous coding is available  to would-be crypto sleuths.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-blockstream-founder-adam-back-checks-all-the-boxes-as-satoshi,cointelegraph,2020-05-26,00:00:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis , Cardano and Ethereum Price Surge Alongside Bitcoin — Will XLM Follow? ,"The price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been trading in a defined range over the past weeks as the halving hype has passed. Bitcoin’s price action also led to increased volatility in altcoins and some of the smaller altcoins have been showing impressive strength. So far, Theta Token ( THETA ) and Band Protocol ( BAND ) have been heavy movers. However, in the previous days, the larger cap altcoins have started to move up, with Cardano ( ADA ) and Ether ( ETH ) as the primary movers. As Bitcoin attempts to find a way back to $10,000, traders will closely watch to see if there is more to follow from these large cap altcoins. Crypto market daily performance. Source:  Coin360 Ether breaks through the $215 barrier ETH USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The daily chart is showing an evident compression between $195 and $215, which finally broke to the upside. Alongside that, the chart is also showing some critical metrics for further upward momentum. Key indicators for bull or bear markets are the support above or below the 100-day and 200-day moving average. As long as the price of a certain asset continues to move above the moving averages the asset is in bull territory. Why is that important? Throughout the entire previous bull cycle, the price of Ethereum remained above these indicators, leading to a peak of $1,400 in January 2018. Notably, the volume is also massively increasing in recent periods, showing signs of accumulation as volume precedes price. A similar sign is shown on the altcoin market capitalization chart. Altcoin market capitalization prepares to shift toward $110-$140 billion Altcoin market capitalization 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The total market capitalization for altcoins is showing an impressive increase in volume, while the capitalization is also flipping the 100-day and 200-day MA for support. As the chart is showing, the support is found at these MAs in which $68-$72 billion is an essential support. Furthermore, the resistance is established at $113 and $136 billion. This is a vital resistance as the $113 billion level can be compared with the $6,000 floor of Bitcoin in 2018. The price of Bitcoin is now far above the $6,000 barrier, as it’s currently hovering between $9,100 and $10,000. Therefore, it’s time for altcoins to start pacing up, and the next resistance levels are found at the $113 and $136 billion level. If the total market capitalization rallies towards the $136 billion level, that would mean a surge of 60% for the entire altcoin market capitalization. What’s happening with Cardano? ADA USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The strongest large-cap altcoin in the past week has been Cardano which has moved 30% in recent days. This last push made the cryptocurrency rally towards the levels from February 2020, through which all the losses of the March 12 market crash have vanished. What’s behind this push? From a fundamental perspective, a new roadmap for the release of Shelley is complete, triggering a further rally on the price. However, on the technical side, the price has been holding the 100-day and 200-day MA as support earlier. After that, the green area around $0.05 became support, which fueled the continuation of the upwards momentum. Right now, the next resistance of this pair is found at $0.07, with a potentially exciting support level at $0.057-$0.06. If the $0.057-$0.06 confirms as support, a potential continuation rally towards $0.07 and $0.09 as the next targets are on the tables. Confluent with previous statements, Cardano’s trading volume is also increasing this week. A possible explanation is that investors are jumping from Bitcoin towards altcoins as various projects are finally starting to release their products and platforms. Will Stellar Lumens follow Cardano? XLM USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView Meanwhile, other large-caps are starting to show signals of potential upwards continuation as well. Cardano has been rallying in the previous days, Ether broke through $213-$215 as a key resistance level. Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) is also showing signals of potential continuation as well. The green zone at $0.06-$0.0625 has to remain a support, but overall the structure is beginning to form a bullish pennant. This is due to the fact the price of Stellar Lumens continues to make higher lows, leading to a potential continuation to the upside. The next primary target for Stellar Lumens is the resistance at $0.085-$0.087. What to expect from the ADA/BTC and ETH/BTC The ETH/BTC pair has been trading inside a range structure since the August-September of 2019. However, since it’s low in September 2019, the price has been making structural higher lows. ETH BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView Through that, the trend for ETH/BTC can be classified as an uptrend. What are the next significant hurdles for Ether? First of all, a breakthrough above the 0.024 sats level should be beneficial for continuation. The 0.024 sats level is confluent with the 200-day MA and needs to be broken for a sustainable extension. As discussed, finding support above the 200-day MA is a vital indicator for further bullish momentum. Once the price of Ether is above the resistance level (whether or not a retest of the 0.021 sats level occurs), a new higher high should be made. By creating a new higher high, the price of Ether will finally break out of this range. If the 0.027 sats level is broken to the upside, the next target lies at 0.034 sats. Where Ether is still fighting the moving averages, is ADA/BTC is already leading the pack and acting above them. ADA BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The Cardano chart in the BTC pair is showing an apparent breakthrough in the resistance at 0.00000625 sats, after which the price rallied towards the next resistance at 0.00000680-0.00000700 sats. This is the last hurdle before a further surge. Preferably, the price should come down for a retest of the 0.00000625-0.00000640 sats level for support. However, once the price of ADA/BTC breaks through the 0.00000690 sats level, a further, mpre sustainable rally towards 0.00001000 - 0.00001070 sats level is on the table. Such a rally would mean a new surge of 60%-70%. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the  author  and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson: 'I Don't Live in Vitalik's Mind' ,"Charles Hoskinson  does not know why his fellow  Ethereum  ( ETH ) co-founder Vitalik Buterin will not acknowledge the existence of  Cardano  ( ADA ) while speaking enthusiastically about other blockchain projects. Ignore fetish In a  recent Cointelegraph interview , Hoskinson lamented Buterin ignoring Cardano. Hoskinson said that this  ignorance of Cardano’s achievements hurts Ethereum , as everything that Cardano does is open source and could be borrowed by the rival. Ethereum has been  plagued by delays in the development  of its second generation proof-of-stake platform. When asked directly about about the crux of this tacit conflict, Hoskinson responded: “I don't live in his mind, so I don't know why he never mentions our project. And, it's his decision not to do that. It’s just a detriment to his ecosystem because there's a lot of ideas in Cardano that could be very useful to Ethereum. And if the leaders of Ethereum decide to just have a blind spot for our project and just not ever reference our tech or our papers other than to criticize them, all they're doing is they're just preventing those ideas from providing value to them. We have no patents and everything's open source and Ethereum is larger than Vitalik.” Buterin would work on a project like Cardano What is even more befuddling to Hoskinson is that Buterin is eager to discuss other projects like  EOS  ( EOS ) but even when prompted by community to talk about Cardano, Buterin, according to Hoskinson, avoids the topic: “Because every now and then you see tweets like, ‘Hey, you know, EOS is an interesting project. Maybe Tezos, but are there any other projects that are interesting?’ And then the immediate follow-on was Vitalik describing Cardano as a project he would work on. When he was describing the features and capabilities and my own community started picking on him on Twitter and being like, you're literally describing what we're working on in Cardano. And of course, there's no engagement or even reply or acknowledgment that Cardano exists. That has to be purposeful.” In Elon Musk’s footsteps? Hoskinson was also perplexed that the only time Buterin took time to discuss Cardano  happened  on Reddit and was not very productive. Yet Buterin eschews discussing Cardano in an academic medium. Hoskinson compared Buterin’s style of interaction with that of Elon Musk: “He's got a big ecosystem. He's very young. He's learning how to be a CEO and he's just going to do things his own way. And you can't really argue with success. He's so far been very successful in that respect. So who knows? Maybe that's the new way to do business. I mean, Elon Musk certainly has a unique way of interacting with people, and it's worked pretty well for him.” Fact checking Finally, it happened, on May 22 (the interview was recorded on May 18) Buterin mentoned Cardano on Twitter: Buterin’s Tweet From May 22 Acknowledging Cardano. Source:  Twitter . On the other hand, Buterin has  discussed  EOS and  Tezos  ( XTZ ) extensively. Is thy face like thy mother’s? The last personal interaction between the two Ethereum alums happened a couple of years ago, when Hoskinson wished Buterin a happy birthday over Skype. Maybe the answer to this hostility lies in the words of one of Hoskinson’s favorite poets, Lord Byron, for whose daughter Ada Loveplace Hoskinson  named  Cardano’s cryptocurrency: “Is thy face like thy mother’s, my fair child! Ada! sole daughter of my house and heart?” Perhaps, Buterin cannot accept the fact  Hoskinson left Ethereum to build  a network of his own.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-i-dont-live-in-vitaliks-mind,cointelegraph,2020-06-02,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano Price Rallies 60% Following Shelley Proof-of-Stake Upgrade Announcement ,"The price of Cardano ( ADA ) has increased 60% in the week following Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson  revealing  the roadmap for the Shelley upgrade in a YouTube podcast with Lark Davis, aka Cryptolark.  Shelley will see the network upgraded from a centralized network to a distributed one through the Shelley protocol upgrade by July 7, viewers were told, in conjunction with details about staking rewards and the hard fork. This is the biggest change in protocols from any blockchain project, according to Hoskinson: “This is like Ripple changing its consensus protocol [...] No cryptocurrency has really done this to this scale after they’ve rolled out.” With the launch date less than a month away, the price has seen significant increases from $0.055 to $0.088 and daily trading volume increasing by more than fourfold. A difficult build-up In the past two years, two teams of developers from IOHK, the firm overseeing Cardano’s progress, have been developing two different versions of the staking protocol — a Byron-derived approach (currently live) and a “Haskell”-based Shelley system. Hoskinson announced that Cardano will transition to the Shelley protocol by early July. “The current protocol, Byron, has been out for about 2 years now.” Currently, the Shelley Incentivized Testnet, or ITN, is doing the final tests before launch.The ecosystem maturity has resulted in a large number of supporters and node operators already being in loop with the project’s development, with 1,200 node operators on ITN. The difficulty in developing and conducting this transition has been intense for the team, said Hoskinson, with unique challenges not normally faced by blockchain projects: “I’m really proud of everybody. It’s been a long time coming and it’s been a difficult year because we’ve had to change the tires while the car is running. What we’re creating is basically the world’s next operating system.” An intense rivalry  Cardano and Tezos ( XTZ ) have gone head-to-head in the last few days to get the 10th position among the top coins by market cap, with both projects sitting a little over a $2 billion cap. On Twitter, Hoskinson likened it to the famous fight between Gandalf and the Balrog in Lord of the Rings: Tezos and Cardano are doing this on CMC  https://t.co/jPGUUTV3zE  it’s as entertaining to watch. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles)  June 2, 2020",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-price-rallies-60-following-shelley-proof-of-stake-upgrade-announcement,cointelegraph,2020-06-04,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson: Recursive SNARKs Could Help Bitcoin Scale ,"In a  Cointelegraph interview ,  Charles Hoskinson  said that in his opinion,  recursive snarks  could be a solution for the Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) scalability problems. Intellectual dishonesty Hoskinson believes that there was a lot of intellectual dishonesty in the block size debate, which eventually led to the creation of Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ). Discussing the main argument of the Bitcoin core supporters that the increase in block size would have led to the greater centralization of the network, Hoskinson said: “Just an insane argument. And this is the intellectual dishonesty of that argument. So that's like saying: ‘network capacity, CPUs  and hard disks are never going to increase in size. I mean, what is it? You created Bitcoin in 2009? What was the average bandwidth of a network connection? What was the average amount of disk storage and the CPU power person has? My cell phone today is as powerful as the most powerful gaming PC you could buy in 2009.” Roger Ver is not a bad actor He is also of the opinion that  Roger Ver  should have been accommodated and that the split that followed is an example of bad governance: “Governance fails when your country splits apart and you have the civil war or when your project splits. So the fact that Bitcoin Cash exists is an example of a failure of governance. Roger is not a bad actor. He's a principled actor and he believes very firmly in his viewpoints. He should have been accommodated to an extent where he didn't feel the need to actually create his own cryptocurrency.” Hoskinson believes that recursive SNARKs is one possible solution that could help Bitcoin scale: “For example, you could use recursive SNARKs and have a light client experience, but still have full node security. <...> You can have a backbone that has large blocks and it's huge and it's mostly enterprise grade and that's where power users and then the everyday user uses the light client, but they still have full node security and they have inclusive accountability.” The hunt for the SNARK A  zk-SNARK  or zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge, is a technology that allows a party to demonstrate that it possesses certain information without revealing it. In addition to presenting better privacy, another advantage of this technology is that the proof of possession takes much less space than the actual information itself.  With recursive SNARKs, a party can present a proof of a proof, which compresses the data even further. If Bitcoin were to employ this methodology, it would gain almost an infinite transactional capacity. However, there is a price to pay for this scalability — if parameters are not properly configured, the security of the network could be compromised. Zcash ( ZEC ), a privacy-centric cryptocurrency, is built on this technology.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, ETH, LINK, ADA, ETC ","When the price of an asset does not reverse direction from a critical resistance, it indicates that some traders are holding onto their positions in anticipation of a breakout. For the past month, Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been repeatedly revisiting the $10,000 levels and even though the bulls have not been able to sustain above this level, they have not given up much ground either. This suggests that traders are accumulating on dips and not closing their positions at $10,000. This is a bullish sign and it increases the possibility of a breakout above the resistance in the short-term. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Before and after the halving, institutional investors have also been building larger Bitcoin positions. As reported by Cointelegraph, crypto fund manager Grayscale has aggressively been buying the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap and recent reporting shows they also purchased about  $110 million  worth of Ether ( ETH ). This strong inflow of funds into the top two cryptocurrencies bodes well for the sector. The next few days are critical as they will determine whether the crypto market will trend higher or take a break. If Bitcoin rises, these other crypto assets could offer a buying opportunity. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) is at a critical juncture. On June 1, the bulls propelled the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. However, due to lack of follow up buying, the price dipped back into the triangle on June 2. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Since then, the BTC/USD pair has been trading between the 20-day simple moving average ($9,423) and the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. This suggests buying on dips at lower levels. If the bulls can push the price above the triangle once again, a rally to $10,500 is possible. The bears are likely to defend this level aggressively but if the bulls can scale it, a new uptrend is likely. The pattern target of a breakout of the triangle is $11,778. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the 20-day SMA. In such a case, a drop to the support line of the symmetrical triangle is possible. Below the triangle, a drop to $8,130.58 is likely. However, the probability of such a fall remains low. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart shows that the bulls were able to drive the price above the resistance line of the triangle on two occasions but they could not build up on the breakout. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. However, on the downside, the bulls are not allowing the sellers to sink the price to the support line of the triangle. This is a positive sign. If the price rebounds off the current levels, the bulls are likely to make one more attempt to push the price above the triangle. If successful, the pair is likely to move up to $10,400–$10,500. Therefore, traders may look for entries above $9,900 and a stop-loss at $9,500. Taking partial profits closer to $10,500 might be wise if the pair struggles to break free of this resistance and the stops on the rest of the position can be kept at breakeven. If the pair ascends $10,500 levels, it could start the next leg of the sustained up move. Conversely, if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $9,400, a drop to $9,200 is likely. The bulls will make an aggressive attempt to defend this support zone because if it gives way, a deeper correction is possible. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) is in an uptrend and has been trading inside the ascending channel for the past few weeks. Currently, the price is stuck between the 10-day exponential moving average ($235) and the downtrend line. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If the  second-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap bounces off the 10-day EMA and breaks out of the downtrend line, the uptrend is likely to continue. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 10-day EMA, a drop to the 20-day SMA ($223) is possible. However, as the bulls have held the support line of the channel on three previous occasions (marked as ellipse on the chart), a bounce off it can also offer a buying opportunity to the traders. ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The bears are aggressively defending the downtrend line while the bulls are attempting to keep the ETH/USD pair above $236. If the pair slips below $236, it can drop to $229 and then to the support line of the ascending channel. If the pair bounces off the support line of the ascending channel, it can offer a buying opportunity to the traders with a close stop-loss kept just below the channel. Another buying opportunity will open up if the pair bounces off $236 and breaks out of the downtrend line. Traders will likely buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line with a stop-loss below $229. The first target on the upside is $252 and then $270. A change in trend is likely to be signaled if the pair plummets below the channel. Therefore, bullish positions below the channel should be avoided. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) broke out of an ascending triangle on June 1. The pattern target of this bullish breakout is $4.9656. However, the altcoin turned around from $4.6185 and is currently retesting the breakout level. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview If the  14th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap bounces off the 10-day EMA ($4.27) or the breakout level of $4.2129, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move. The moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below the breakout level, a drop to the 20-day SMA ($4.11) and then to the trendline of the triangle is possible. A breakdown of the triangle will be a negative sign that will signal a possible change in trend from bullish to range-bound. LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart suggests that the bulls are struggling to hold on to the higher levels. The moving averages have completed a bearish crossover and the RSI has also dipped into the negative territory, which suggests that bears are attempting to make a comeback in the short-term. However, the bulls are likely to step in and defend the breakout level of $4.2129 aggressively. If the rebound off this support rises above the downtrend line it will signal a possible resumption of the uptrend. Opening a position above the downtrend line and keeping a stop-loss below $4.10 might be a reasonable trade setup. The first target objective would be a rally to $4.6185, then $4.9656. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the LINK/USD pair below the trendline of the ascending triangle.  ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) has been in a strong uptrend for the past few days. If the trend is strong, the bulls usually buy the dips to the 10-day EMA ($0.079). Even if this level is broken, the possibility of a bounce off the 20-day SMA ($0.068) remains high. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the  10th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is witnessing profit booking. However, both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls remain in command.  Therefore, if the price bounces off the 10-day EMA, the bulls will make another attempt to reach the stiff overhead resistance at $0.10. In the past, this level has acted as a strong resistance, hence, the bears are likely to defend it aggressively once again. If the 10-day EMA breaks down, a deeper correction to the 20-day SMA is possible. Such a fall would signal weakening momentum and increase the likelihood of a range formation for a few days. ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart shows that the bulls are defending the zone between $0.0839747–$0.0832290 but are struggling to propel the ADA/USD pair above the downtrend line. This suggests that the bears are posing stiff resistance at higher levels. If the pair rebounds off the current levels and rallies above $0.0901373, it is likely to resume its uptrend. Traders might look at buying half the desired position size after the pair closes (UTC time) above the moving averages and the rest of the position can be added above $0.0901373. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $0.0832, a drop to 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.0810950 and then to 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.0789610 is possible. A strong bounce off these levels could also offer a buying opportunity with a close stop-loss. The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $0.0789610. Below this support, a drop to $0.0759228 and then to $0.0720527 is possible. ETC/USD Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) turned down at the overhead resistance of $7.62717 on May 31. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. Currently, the altcoin has dropped to the trendline of the ascending triangle. ETC/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview If the  20th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap rebounds off the trendline support, the bulls will probably attempt to push the price back towards $7.62717. A breakout of this level will be a huge positive as it will complete an ascending triangle pattern. Conversely, if the price breaks below the trendline, a deeper pullback is likely. Below the trendline, a drop to $6 and below it to $5.50 is possible. The 10-day EMA is gradually sloping down and the RSI is just below the 50 level, which suggests that bears are trying to make a comeback. ETC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The ETC/USD pair has dropped to the trendline of the ascending triangle. If the pair bounces off this level and rises above $7, traders can initiate long positions with a stop-loss below the trendline. Traders may look to book partial profits close to $7.60 and trail the rest with a close stop-loss because if the momentum can drive the price above $7.62 the ascending triangle will complete. This bullish setup has a target objective of $9.74. Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the pair below the trendline, it will signal weakness. Therefore, traders should avoid buying when the price stays below the trendline.

cardano, News , Cardano Founder Charles Hoskinson Calls Crypto a 'Political Movement’ ,"Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano ( ADA ), has described participating in cryptocurrency as an inherently  political  act. Speaking during an impromptu  ask-me-anything  on YouTube, Hoskinson asserted that crypto-driven fundamental disruptions to monetary relations will not come without struggle, placing the crypto phenomenon within the political arena.  Hoskinson also urged members of the crypto community to take a stand against increasing regulatory moves to crack down on encryption. Crypto is inherently political In the AMA streamed on June 5,  Charles Hoskinson  proclaimed that “Crypto is a political movement.”  ""Crypto is as political as it gets,” he said. “We’re going to reinvent the concept of money and take it out of the government’s hands and control it ourselves.”  Hoskinson emphasized that the cryptocurrency phenomenon is especially political by nature due to the creative destruction it seeks to bring upon monetary commodities and policy, stating that “money is the biggest influence of all of politics.”  Considering the consequences of the wholesale adoption of distributed ledger technologies, Hoskinson noted that the impacts of cryptocurrency will reach far beyond the domain of money, stating: “Everything has to change: trade changes, property rights change, business change, the business structure changes, laws change.” Regulators move against encryption Hoskinson predicted that crypto assets will face increasing hostility from  regulators , saying, “There are people in the Senate and the Congress today in the United States and all around the world who want to ban crypto.”  The Cardano creator urged the crypto community to fight against regulatory efforts to constrain crypto, stating, “If you’re in this industry, what do you do? Do you just roll over like a dead dog and say, ‘It was a lot of fun okay, alright, whatever.’ No, I’m sorry, You have to have an opinion. You have to fight for the right things.” “Right now, there’s a strong movement to ban encryption so that when you have encryption, you need to have a backdoor in the system,” asserted Hoskinson.  “Will you guys use Cardano if it has backdoors in it and we designed the system that way and some small group of people have control over your money and at any time can freeze it? How many of you would use that?” he asked.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-founder-charles-hoskinson-calls-crypto-a-political-movement,cointelegraph,2020-06-08,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Hyperledger Adds 8 New Partners Including IOV Labs,"Hyperledger, the Linux Foundation’s open source umbrella project, has announced partnerships with eight new organizations. The community, which was founded in 2015 to advance cross-chain blockchain technologies, has linked up with IOV Labs, DB Systel GmbH, and IOHK, the development company behind Cardano. Reflecting on recent challenges caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, Hyperledger’s Executive Director Brian Behlendorf remarked that “the enterprise blockchain community has shown great solidarity and is now focused on new ways forward. As our line-up of new members underscore, the Hyperledger community is about putting blockchain to work in impactful ways around the world and across industries.” Hyperledger’s existing member organizations include IBM, Intel, Citi, American Express, Airbus, and J.P. Morgan, and it continues to develop its frameworks, tools and libraries for enterprise-grade blockchain deployments across various industries. As well as IOV Labs, DB Systel GmbH and IOHK, new members include Atomyze by Tokentrust AG, Binarystar, Public Mint, the Global Blockchain Business Council, and the InterWork Alliance. The latest announcement follows a series of Linux virtual meet-ups and summits, with another planned for June 29-July 2 featuring Behlendorf. The initiative’s latest project is Hyperledger Cactus, an open source collaboration between Fujitsu Laboratories and Accenture. Each of the new partners will rely on Hyperledger’s blockchain solutions. Swiss blockchain startup Atomyze, for example, is developing a tokenization platform for the commodities industry and will utilize Hyperledger Fabric, the first Hyperledger project to hit the 2.0 milestone. IOV Labs, meanwhile, will utilize Hyperledger’s Ethereum client,  Besu , to further develop enterprise and government-oriented projects. By partnering with the Linux Foundation and deploying Hyperledger Besu,  IOV Labs  – the parent company of Bitcoin smart contract platform RSK – hopes to “accelerate the adoption of open blockchain standards that foster financial freedom, transparency and trust,” according to CEO Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar. “All of the software used within the RSK network and developed by IOV Labs is open sourced, and our ethos closely aligns with that of Linux,” he added. To date, IOV Labs has developed several blockchain-dependent solutions for enterprises including  Gasnet , a blockchain network for Argentina’s natural gas distribution ecosystem, and a  proof of concept  for the nation’s central bank. Last year, IOV Labs purchased Spanish-language social network Taringa, with plans to turn it into a bitcoin-powered social marketplace. Public Mint , a fiat-native blockchain platform that lets users transfer funds to and from people, businesses, devices, applications and banks, is also building on Besu. The Hyperledger project welcomes contributions from open source projects, nonprofits and governments, at no cost to associate members. Last year, Hyperledger worked with the government of British Columbia to develop an open software stack to build trusted digital relationships and help eliminate red tape. Elsewhere, Fujitsu Laboratories and Accenture are collaborating on Hyperledger Cactus, an open source software collaborative effort designed to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies hosted by the Linux Foundation.",https://u.today/hyperledger-adds-8-new-partners-including-iov-labs,utoday,2020-06-12,15:33:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano’s IOHK and Global Blockchain Business Council Join Hyperledger ,"Eight new members have joined  Hyperledger , including several firms targeting tokenization initiatives. Hyperledger is a consortium of firms working on open-source enterprise solutions using distributed ledger technologies ( DLT) . Launched in December 2015 by the Linux Foundation, the project has since received contributions from IBM, Intel, and other leading tech firms exploring blockchain applications. Blockchain veterans among the  new members , include IOHK, the company behind Cardano ( ADA ), IOV Labs — formerly RIF Labs — and crypto-friendly payments platform Public Mint.  Other new entrants include Japanese consulting and PR firm Binarystar, and Atomyze, a tokenization platform launched by Switzerland’s TokenTrust AG. DB Systel GmbH, is a digital-focused subsidiary of German railway company Deutsche Bahn. Moritz von Bonin, the company’s head of blockchain and DLT solutions, said the company is working on applications for distributed ledger technologies in the context of mobility services, logistics supply chains, and rail control systems. Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director, Hyperledger said: “As our line-up of new members underscore, the Hyperledger community is about putting blockchain to work in impactful ways around the world and across industries."" Associating with Hyperledger The Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) and the InterWork Alliance are also joining Hyperledger as new associate members. The non-profit InterWork Alliance  launched  earlier this month with the aim of establishing standardized frameworks across platforms supporting distributed applications and tokens. The GBBC works to engage lawmakers, publishes research on  tokenization , and promotes its Global Blockchain Standards Initiative. Hyperledger pushes for tokenization standards Earlier this month, Hyperledger established an alliance alongside tech conglomerates  Microsoft  and  IBM  to develop global standards for tokenized ecosystems. In an interview with Cointelegraph, IWA chairman Marlay Gray emphasized the importance of widespread standardization as a requisite foundation for the widespread adoption of tokenization: “Without a standardized set of common terms, definitions and business level specifications, developers have to interpret inconsistent business requirements and translate them to write code for every blockchain platform and each token standard for a token-based business use case to work. This complexity makes wide-scale adoption difficult,” Gray said.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardanos-iohk-and-global-blockchain-business-council-join-hyperledger,cointelegraph,2020-06-12,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Developer Activity Surrounding Eos, Tron, and Bitcoin Cash Plummets ","A report published by  blockchain  and  AI  investment firm Outlier Ventures has found a decline in developer activity of roughly 20% on average across 12 leading blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. In Outlier Ventures’  Blockchain Developer Report  for the second quarter of 2020, the firm notes that development fell by half for top markets Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ), Eos ( EOS ), and Tron Tron ( TRX ). Despite the retraction in building, the firm notes that some signs of strong developer activity surrounding various crypto projects, with Theta ( THETA ) and Cardano ( ADA ) seeing increases in core code updates of 931% and 580% respectively. Top crypto projects see slides in development Eos saw the fastest drop in development, with the project’s mainnet launch in June year precipitating an 86% fall in building taking place. Bitcoin Cash saw the second-largest decline in activity, with development falling by 63%. Outlier Ventures attributes much of the drop to the Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) fork that took place in November 2018. Tron also saw a heavy retracement in development, with a 53% drop in activity. Monthly active development on Tron, Eos, and Bitcoin Cash:  Outlier Ventures Cardano, Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ethereum ( ETH ), and Corda all saw activity fall by nearly 20%, while Ripple ( XRP ), Hyperledger, and Stellar ( XLM ) also saw development declines year-over-year.

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, XTZ, XLM, ADA, NEO ","Takeshi Fujimaki, a former adviser to George Soros, has said that Paul Tudor Jones is attempting to capture the big trend. According to Fujimaki, Jones’ recent  investment  into Bitcoin ( BTC ) indicates that he is concerned about inflation and believes that cryptocurrencies could benefit in such an environment. Following the recent growth and popularity of Grayscale’s Bitcoin Trust security in the past few months, investment firm Wilshire Phoenix has  filed  an application with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a publicly traded Bitcoin fund. If the fund gets the green signal it is likely to attract institutional investors. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 For the past few weeks the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap has been struggling to break out of the $10,000–$10,500 resistance zone. This can attract profit booking by short-term bulls and shorting by aggressive bears. If BTC weakens further it is likely to have a knock on effect on altcoins but this could also bring about some lucrative investment opportunities. Let’s look at a few cryptocurrencies that may offer trading opportunities to bulls and bears. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) is witnessing a tussle between the bulls and the bears. The bulls are attempting to scale the price above the $10,000–$10,500 overhead resistance zone in order to resume the up move. On the other hand, the bears are trying to form a short-term top at the $10,000 levels. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The BTC/USD pair turned down from the critical level of $10,000 on June 10 and slumped to the 50-day simple moving average ($9,254) on June 11. Hence, traders should watch these two levels carefully because the next trending move is likely to start after the price breaks out of either level. If the pair rises above the 10-day exponential moving average ($9,548), the bulls will try to carry the price to $10,000 levels. A breakout of the $10,000–$10,500 zone will signal the possible start of a sustainable uptrend. Conversely, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA a deeper correction to $8,638.70 and then to $8,130.58 is likely. A break below this support could attract further selling and result in a downtrend. Currently, as the 50-day SMA is still sloping up, the intermediate trend favors the bulls while the short-term trend has turned indecisive as seen from the up and down movement of the 10-day EMA. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The bulls purchased the dip below the trendline (shown via ellipse on the chart) but they are finding it difficult to sustain the rebound. This suggests selling on any pullback by the bears. In the short-term, the downtrend line is acting as a resistance. If the pair breaks above the downtrend line, the bulls might make one more attempt to carry the price to $10,058.52. This move could present a trading opportunity to the aggressive traders. Conversely, if the price turns down and breaks down of the trendline, it will signal an advantage to the bears. If the price sustains below the trendline the bears will make another attempt to sink the pair below $9,078.96. If this is successful then a new downtrend is possible. XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) had been trading in an ascending channel for the past few weeks. However, on June 11, the altcoin plunged below the channel, which is a huge negative. The large red candle shows that bears were in command. XTZ/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview With this breakdown, the  11th-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap also slipped below the 50-day SMA ($2.75). Both moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover and the RSI is in the negative territory, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. If bears sink the price below the $2.5202 intraday low formed on June 11, a downtrend is likely to begin. The next support on the downside is $2.24, which was the intraday low made on May 10. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls reverse direction and push the price back above the downtrend line. In such a case, the trend might turn range-bound in the near-term. XTZ/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart shows that the selling picked up momentum after the price slipped below the channel and further intensified on a break below the horizontal support at $2.8085. On the pullback from the lows, the bears aggressively defended the 10-EMA, which is another bearish sign. If the bears can sink the price below $2.5202, the XTZ/USD pair is likely to pick up momentum on the downside. This could offer a shorting opportunity to aggressive traders. However, if the bulls defend the $2.589–$2.5202 zone aggressively, the pair might rise to $2.70 and then to $2.7568 and remain range-bound for a few days. The bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls propel the price above the downtrend line. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) plummeted below the support line of the ascending channel and the 50-day SMA ($0.071) on June 11. While this is a negative sign, the bears have not been able to build upon this breakdown. XLM/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview This suggests that bulls are buying on dips and are trying to keep the  13th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap inside the channel. However, the bears are not allowing the bulls to have it easy as they are attempting to stall the recovery and start a new downtrend. If the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $0.068607, a drop to $0.063509 and then to $0.59404 is possible. Conversely, if the bulls can carry the price above the downtrend line, a rally to $0.079319 and then to $0.086277 is likely. The altcoin can go either way and offer trading opportunities to both bulls and bears. XLM/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The bears are aggressively defending the resistance at $0.074. If the XLM/USD pair continues lower and breaks below $0.068607, it is likely to attract further selling. This could offer a shorting opportunity to the aggressive traders. On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above $0.074 and the downtrend line, the momentum is likely to pick up. This could offer a buying opportunity to the bulls. Above the downtrend line, a rally to $0.08 and then to $0.086277 is likely. As the pair can move either way, traders should be careful with the first breakout or breakdown because the possibilities of a bull trap or a bear trap are high. It is better to wait for the breakout to sustain before initiating any trades. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) is currently witnessing a pullback in an uptrend. The 50-day SMA ($0.061) is sloping up, which suggests that the intermediate trend is up. However, the short-term has turned negative as seen from the downsloping 10-day EMA ($0.079). ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The pullback is a healthy sign because it has helped the  10th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap correct the huge overbought levels on the RSI. Currently, the bulls are attempting to provide support at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.0751964. If the rebound off this support can sustain above $0.0806825, it will increase the likelihood of a retest of $0.0901373 and if this level is scaled, the uptrend could resume. However, if the bears sink the price below $0.0751964, a drop to the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of $0.0705811 and $0.0659658 is possible. The deeper the pullback, lower will be the chances of a resumption of the up move. ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Both moving averages on the four-hour chart are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the $0.0740–$0.0720 support zone, the bulls will attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. A breakout of $0.0806825 can open up trading opportunities to the upside. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair sinks below the support zone. Such a move will indicate that bears have a firm grip. In such a case, long positions can be avoided. NEO/USD NEO  is at a critical level. The 50-day SMA ($10.34) is sloping up, which suggests that the intermediate trend is up. However, on June 10, the altcoin broke below the support line of the ascending channel, which suggests that the upside momentum is weakening. NEO/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Even though the bulls purchased the dips on June 10, the subsequent rebound has been weak. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. Another negative sign is that the bulls are struggling to keep the price inside the channel. If the bears sink the  19th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap below $10.42133, the selling is likely to intensify. The next support to watch out on the downside is $9.21399 and then $8.60349. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price back above the 10-day EMA ($11.27) and the downtrend line, it will suggest aggressive buying by the bulls at lower levels. This will increase the possibility of a rally to $12.2839 and then to $12.1711. NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart shows that bulls are struggling to keep the price inside the ascending channel. This is a negative sign as this indicates selling on rallies. If the NEO/USD pair breaks below $10.42133, it could open up the gates for further downsides to $9.58498 and then to $9.21399. Traders may attempt to ride this move lower using short positions. The 50-SMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, indicating that bears have the upper hand. However, if the bulls purchase the dip once again and propel the pair above the downtrend line, it is likely to attract further buying.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Says It’s About Time He Gets Twitter Verified as It Could Prevent Scams With His Name ,"The founder of Cardano , one of the most popular blockchain platforms, stated that he is often impersonated by con artists on Twitter who scam money out of other users.  Mr. Hoskinson believes that if Twitter gave him a blue check mark, it would be able to prevent daily scams that use Hoskinson's name. The Cardano founder  has taken to Twitter to address the Twitter CEO, Jack Dorsey. He hinted that it was about time Twitter gave him a blue check mark, since fraudsters impersonate him on a daily basis to scam other people. His tweet came as a response to  a post from Caitlin Long , an Avanti Bank & Trust founder. Ms. Long pointed out that an avatar bearing a blue check mark means that the person behind the account is verified, which could help others tell a scam from a real account if need be. In the comment thread, some users suggested that Mr. Hoskinson DM Twitter customer support. Others pointed out (as a joke) that the blue check mark is given to people with the same name – ‘the wrong Charles Hoskinson’ – and emphasized the fact that the Cardano creator has a lot more followers than Caitlin Long.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-says-its-about-time-he-gets-twitter-verified-as-it-could-prevent-scams-with-his,utoday,2020-06-19,13:43:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, ETH, ADA, LEO, XMR ","Only about  3.5 million  Bitcoin ( BTC ) are available for trading, according to new data from blockchain analytics firm Chainalysis. The remaining 11.4 million are held as long-term investment and 3.7 million are believed to be lost.  This suggests that if institutional investors enter the crypto space and invest for the long-term, the tradeable supply of the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap is likely to shrink further and possibly boost the price of BTC. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 In a recent  interview  with Cointelegraph Markets, Max Keiser, host of the Keiser Report, said that Paul Tudor Jones is likely to become “the biggest HODL’er of Bitcoin within 2 years.”  In other news, Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, the largest hedge fund in the world,  said  that equity investors might be staring at a possible “lost decade” as globalization ""has already peaked.”  If this happens, institutional investors are likely to gradually enter the crypto space in search of higher returns. All these fundamentals point to higher prices in the future but how does the short-term picture look? Let’s analyze the charts. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) dipped below $9,078.96 on June 15 but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness as bulls provided support at $8,910.04. This suggests strong demand at lower levels. However, the rebound has not been able to sustain above the 10-day exponential moving average ($9,425), suggesting selling at higher levels. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The 50-day simple moving average ($9,402) is gradually flattening out and the relative strength index has been trading close to the midpoint. This suggests a balance between supply and demand, which could result in a range-bound action for a few more days. This view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the $9,078.86–$8,910.04 support zone. If that happens, a short-term down move is possible. There is a minor support at $8,638.79 and if that cracks, the decline can extend to $8,130.58.  Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 10-day EMA–$9,600 resistance zone, a rally to $10,058.82 and then to $10,376.38 is possible. The pair is forming an ascending triangle, which will complete after the price closes (UTC time) above $10,376.38. This pattern has a target objective of $11,986.46.  BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The first sign of strength will be a breakout of the downtrend line. If the price sustains above $9,600, the bulls who have been waiting on the sidelines are likely to jump in. Therefore, a quick rally to $10,000 is possible.  The bears are unlikely to allow the bulls to have it easy at the $10,000 levels. Hence, a minor correction or consolidation can be expected at those levels. This view will be invalidated if the pair slides below the trendline of the triangle. This could retest the recent low of $8,910.04. If this support also cracks, the bulls who have been holding on for the past few weeks are likely to liquidate their positions. Volatility is likely to remain high for the next few days as both bulls and bears attempt to assert their supremacy. Hence, trading with a smaller position size can help reduce the risk. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) has been consolidating between $253.556–$217.670 for the past few days. The 50-day SMA ($220) is flattening out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.  ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview This balance will shift in favor of the bulls if the  second-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap rises above the 10-day EMA ($232). Above this resistance, a rally to $253.556 is likely.  If the bulls can scale the price above $253.556, the uptrend is likely to resume. However, if the price turns down from this resistance, the range-bound action is likely to extend for a few more days. Conversely, if the biggest altcoin continues lower from the current levels, it can drop to $217.67. The bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively. A strong bounce off this level will indicate that the bulls are keen to accumulate at lower levels. A break below $217.67 will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart shows that the ETH/USD pair has rebounded sharply from $217.67 at twice before (marked as ellipse on the chart). This suggests that the bulls are accumulating on dips.  Therefore, if the price again dips to $217.67, the bulls are likely to buy again. A strong bounce off this support might offer an opportunity to the traders. On the upside, a breakout of the downtrend line will be the first sign of strength. Above this resistance, a rally to $240 and then to $253.556 is likely. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $217.67.   ADA/USD The dip in Cardano ( ADA ) to $0.069488 was purchased aggressively on June 15. This is a positive sign as it shows that several traders expect the trend to continue, hence, they are buying the dips. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, the bears are unwilling to give up easily and currently they are defending the horizontal resistance at $0.085. The 10-day EMA ($0.080) has flattened out and the RSI is just above the 50 level, which suggests that the bulls might be tiring out in the short-term. However, as the 50-day SMA ($0.065) is still sloping higher, the medium-trend remains bullish. Alternatively, if the  11th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the downtrend line and breaks below $0.075, it will signal weakness. If that happens, the decline is likely to extend to $0.0694880 and then to the 50-day SMA. ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Although the ADA/USD pair turned down from the downtrend line, the bulls are trying to keep the price above the immediate support of $0.0766328, which is a positive sign. The bulls are again likely to attempt to push the price above the downtrend line. If successful, the traders waiting on the sidelines are likely to enter, which can carry the pair to $0.0901373. There is a minor resistance at $0.085 but it is likely to be crossed.  On the other hand, if the bears sink the pair below $0.0766190, a drop to $0.069488 is likely. The bulls are likely to aggressively defend this support, which might present an opportunity to the traders.  LEO/USD Unus Sed Leo ( LEO ) had been in a strong uptrend for the past few months. The strong rally had pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory a few days ago, which suggested that traders were piling on due to fear of missing out on the rally. LEO/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The  15th-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap turned down and succumbed to profit booking between June 13–16. However, a positive is that the bulls purchased the dip below the 50-day SMA ($1.149). This suggests that the sentiment is to buy the dips but the bears are not willing to give up without a fight. They are aggressively defending the 10-day EMA ($1.175). If the price turns down from the 10-day EMA, the bears will attempt to sink the price below $1.12. If successful, a deeper correction to $1.05 is possible. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the 10-day EMA, a retest of the recent highs at $1.26 is possible.  LEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The four-hour chart suggests that the bears are attempting to defend the overhead resistance at $1.184. However, the buyers are not allowing the price to dip below the 10-EMA, which is a bullish sign. The 10-EMA has turned up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the short-term trend is favoring the bulls. A breakout and close (UTC time) above $1.184 is likely to attract further buying by the bulls. Above this level, a rally to $1.24 is possible.  This bullish view will be invalidated if the LEO/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $1.16. The first support on the downside is $1.14 and below that $1.12.  XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) has been forming an ascending triangle pattern for the past few weeks that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the $68.4175– $70.0979 resistance zone. The pattern target of a breakout of the triangle is $82.7887.   XMR/USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the trendline support of the triangle, which is a positive sign. If the  16th-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap rises above the 10-day EMA ($65), the bulls will make another attempt to carry the price to the overhead resistance zone. This bullish view will be invalidated if the altcoin turns down from the 10-day EMA and breaks below the trendline. A break below the $62–$60 support is likely to intensify selling resulting in a possible drop to $54.0463. XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The rebound off the trendline is facing resistance at the 50-SMA. If the XMR/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the trendline, a drop to $62 is possible. However, if the bulls can propel the price above the 50-SMA and sustain it, the bulls are likely to jump in and carry the price to $67 and then to $68.4175.  Although this level is likely to attract selling, the bulls have scaled this level on two previous occasions. Therefore, if they can drive the price above this resistance once again, a retest of $70.0979 will be on the cards.

cardano, News , New Bill to Outlaw Encryption Without Gov’t Backdoor in US Senate ,"Three Republican senators introduced a bill to end “warrant-proof” encryption on June 23. It invokes national security as a pretext for requiring device manufacturers and service providers to assist law enforcement by providing access to encrypted data. 
 Pedophiles & national security 
 The Lawful Access to Encrypted Data Act is sponsored by Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Tom Cotton (R-AR) and Marsha Blackburn (R-TN). According to  GovTrack , all three senators score high on the conservativeness scale, with Blackburn receiving a perfect 1.00.  
 Graham is also one of the sponsors of the EARN IT Act, which many privacy advocates heavily  criticized for what they perceived as encroaching on personal freedoms  under the guise of protecting children from sexual abuse.  
 It is not clear why Graham and his colleagues felt the need to propose a bill that, on the surface, seems to have similar goals to the EARN IT Act — stripping the individuals of the right to use privacy-preserving technology while forcing technology companies to become even more responsive to the state’s whims. Perhaps the idea is that at least one of the cards that the bill plays — national security or child welfare — will get the job done. 
 End to ‘warrant-proof’ encryption 
 The press release says that the proposed legislation “would bring an end to warrant-proof encryption in devices, platforms, and systems,” a debate that has  raged for years . Also, it stresses that companies would be required to cooperate with the authorities only after a warrant is issued by the court: 
 “The bill would require service providers and device manufacturers to provide assistance to law enforcement when access to encrypted devices or data is necessary — but only after a court issues a warrant, based on probable cause that a crime has occurred, authorizing law enforcement to search and seize the data.” 
 If this bill ever gets passed, the crypto industry might be especially affected. Cryptographic algorithms are at the core of Bitcoin ( BTC ) and other cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, the decentralized nature of many projects in this space, may make the industry better prepared.  
 Ava & Cardano would not yield 
 Cointelegraph reached out to some of the prominent members of the crypto community for commentary.  
 Cornell University professor and Ava co-founder  Emin Gün Sirer, answering whether  Ava  would implement a backdoor for government access, said “Absolutely not!” He added that if the bill is passed and law enforcement comes knocking on the door, he would sooner move his project overseas than succumb to pressure. Sirer believes that such lawmaking initiatives hamper national security rather than fostering it: 
 “Countless experts have made it clear, time and time again, that these ideas are misguided: these backdoors represent potential vulnerabilities, and they hate American companies and American competitiveness. At the same time, they force the use of technologies, such as VPNs, that cause communication that poses a national security threat in aggregate to move overseas.” 
 He further noted that privacy-preserving technology is the essence of blockchain: 
 “Emerging technologies, such as blockchains, provide strong privacy guarantees, built into their very fabric. At the forefront of these systems, Ava will reject every effort to build abuse-prone backdoors into its software.” 
 Cardano  ( ADA ) founder  Charles Hoskinson   expressed  a similar sentiment: 
 “No. I will stop working on these systems if legally forced to do so”. 
 Roger Ver  expressed skepticism that political laws have the power to solve what essentially is a math problem: 
 “No amount of violence can solve a math problem. And I think that's a great way of looking at it. Right. So politicians can pass all the bills they want, but it doesn't change the way math works. So no amount of political law making or violence can solve a math problem” 
 Meanwhile, attorney general William P. Barr  issued  a statement strongly supporting the act, pointing out that warrant-proof encryption allows “criminals to operate with impunity,” and that, given the COVID-19 lockdown, it could not be timelier: 
 “The danger is particularly great for children who are targeted online for sexual exploitation, especially during this time of coronavirus lockdowns. Survivors of child sexual abuse and their families have pleaded with technology companies to do more to prevent predators from exploiting their platforms to harm children. We cannot allow these companies to elevate their profits and the privacy rights of these abusers over the safety and security of children.” 
 The likelihood of this bill passing will be greatly  impacted by November elections .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/new-bill-to-outlaw-encryption-without-govt-backdoor-in-us-senate,cointelegraph,2020-06-24,00:00:00,en

Commits will range between $250,000 and $500,000 for either equity or token stakes. The cFund is a 50/50 venture:  IOHK  has already put in the ""anchor"" $10 million, and Wave plans to raise the other half from external investors.

cardano, News ," This Binance Launchpad Alum Believes It Has Cardano, EOS & Algorand Beat ","Elrond  (ERD) believes it has what it takes to overcome the behemoths of the proof-of-stake, or PoS, world. This Romanian PoS blockchain raised $3.25 million in an Initial Exchange Offering, or IEO, in July 2019. Elrond CEO, Beniamin Mincu, told Cointelegraph that  Binance’s IEO process  was very tough. He explained though that through perseverance, the project was able to raise the necessary funds, and receive significant exposure. Ethereum 2.0 — ahead of schedule Elrond’s technological stack  reads  very similar to what has been anticipated for Ethereum ( ETH ) 2.0 — sharding, secure PoS, a virtual machine; however, Mincu drew a number of distinctions between the two: “It is similar. But the difference is essentially that Ethereum is trying to launch this in two years, where Elrond is launching this right now. So we have finished the whole technology. Everything is working. We can process 10,000 thousand transactions per second right now.” Elrond claims to have better architecture than other PoS blockchains When asked about how Elrond is going to compete with much bigger PoS projects such as  Cardano  ( ADA ),  EOS  ( EOS ) and  Algorand  (ALGO), Mincu said: “I would think that compared to all the other ones, Elrond has a much more fundamentally performant architecture. So we beat them in any way you can measure, second, from a resource reward perspective for PoS architectures, we have a more competitive reward system right now for validators.” Mincu believes that one of the keys to the success in this space is user experience, and he says that Elrond has a big advantage there.

From now on, Cardano users will be able to store and stake ADA tokens in Coinbase’s ‘institutional-grade’ cold wallet. 
 
 The tie-up became the highlight of the second day of IOHK’s virtual summit that is taking place on July 2-3.   While commenting on the news, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson expressed his hope that Coinbase would become the custodian of choice for many institutional holders of ADA.  Hoskinson praised the San Francisco-based company for its ‘safety, security, and competence’: ‘I’ve been in the space long enough to see things like Mt. Gox, and I’ve been in the space long enough to see every single year numerous exchange problems occur, and it’s refreshing to see that there is an organization that deeply cares about security, that deeply cares about quality experiences, and really gives people the time of day to work with them.’   Since Coinbase Custody opened its doors in 2018, it has managed to accrue over $7 bln worth of assets under management.  ADA holders can delegate their tokens to stake pools while keeping them secure with the help of Coinbase Custody.

 How many ADAs out there? 
 At the time of this writing, CoinMarketCap, or CMC,  shows  ADA in seventh spot, while Nomics  has  it at sixth —- just ahead of BSV. The controversy stems from the circulating supply —- CMC reports 25,927,070,538, while Nomics has the figure at 31,112,484,646. This represents a five billion ADA discrepancy. Blockchair, a blockchain search and analytics engine,  agrees  with Nomics. 
 Nomics CTO Nick Gauthier pointed out that the difference comes from the fact that his company includes ADAs allocated to the Cardano Foundation, IOHK, and Emurgo in the circulating supply, while, apparently CMC does not. According to a cached copy of the Cardano Foundation website, the three entities were given 648,176,761, 2,463,071,701 and 2,074,165,644 ADA tokens respectively. These numbers add up to 5,185,414,106 —- precisely the difference between the amount reported by various data providers. Based on the current ADA price, these tokens are worth about $590 million. 
 Do company tokens count? 
 The question still arises of whether these tokens should be included in the circulating supply. This should probably depend on the lockup mechanisms, if any, for the tokens remaining with those organizations. Presumably,  some of the tokens have been spent  and thus have become part of the circulating supply. The updated version of the site does not have any information on token distribution. 
 Cointelegraph reached out to IOHK for clarification, but did not receive a response in time for publication.

 Spring ADA bull run 
 Regardless of the circulating supply issue, ADA has been on a remarkable bull run that ensued after Black Thursday. On March 11. At that time, the price of ADA was $0.024; as of this writing, it is $0.114. The difference represents a 475% appreciation. It is still far below its all-time high of $1.16, set in January 2018. 
 IOHK, the Cardano development company, has reached a number of key milestones and public announcements during this time. The biggest news was the  launch of the Shelley mainnet . Around the same time, a decentralized identity solution, Atala PRISM, was unveiled. There was also news about ADA holders being able to stake their coins while in Coinbase custody, and speculation on the likelihood of it being  listed on the exchange by the end of 2020 . 
 This momentum also comes on the heels of the  Cardano Virtual Summit . According to Charles Hoskison was bigger than Consensus, having been a host to more than 10,000 guests.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardanos-ada-is-either-6-or-7-by-market-capitalization-depending-on-who-counts,cointelegraph,2020-07-07,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Max Keiser Sides with Peter Schiff While Bashing Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson,"In an expected turn of events, Bitcoin maximalist and RT host Max Keiser praised Peter Schiff as ‘principled and unimpeachable’  in his latest tweet .   Keiser sided with Schiff, an unapologetic crypto critic, to get back at IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson, who recently responded to the backlash he and other industry participants had faced over ‘PPP’ loans. card After it came to light that IOHK USA LLC received up to $1 mln worth of bailout money, Hoskinson slammed  Cardano (ADA)  as a ‘failed project.’    In  his video , Hoskinson acknowledged that PPP was a ‘dumpster fire’ and a ‘bad idea.’ That said, he didn’t like the fact that U.S. taxpayers would fund his competitors (and not him): ‘So, I either have a choice of getting some to recover the fact that my competitors just got some free money or to not do that’         Hoskinson also mentioned that Cardano was doing ‘okay’ for a failure. As  reported by U.Today , the ADA token recently toppled Litecoin (LTC), becoming the seventh-largest cryptocurrency.     
 
This, evidently, wasn’t enough to assuage Keiser who continued to claim that Hoskinson’s moral flexibility was part of the problem. 
  
 After calling Schiff an ‘imbecile’ and routinely  bickering with him on Twitter  over the price of Bitcoin, Keiser now claims that Schiff shows the cryptocurrency community how to preserve its integrity with his unwavering stance against PPP loans.  The gold bug believes that none of the 600 asset management firms that took the money actually needed it to stay afloat and challenged them to prove him wrong. Considering how critical the crypto industry is of ‘free money,’ the fact that the likes of ConsenSys and ShapeShift accepted the bailout money  sparked quite a controversy .",https://u.today/max-keiser-sides-with-peter-schiff-while-bashing-cardanos-charles-hoskinson,utoday,2020-07-08,07:20:00,en
cardano, Markets News , 3 Reasons Cardano (ADA) Suddenly Surged by 85% in 10 Days ,"The price of Cardano ( ADA ) increased from $0.074 to $0.137, by more than 85% in less than two weeks. It surpassed Bitcoin SV (BSV) to become the  sixth-largest cryptocurrency  by market capitalization. Cardano surpasses Bitcoin SV in market capitalization. Source:  CoinMarketCap.com Three factors likely caused the intense rally of ADA in recent weeks. The potential catalysts are the new Shelley upgrade, favorable market structure and the rapid growth of the decentralized finance ( DeFi ) market. Why the Shelley upgrade is so important for Cardano, and ultimately ADA price On July 1, a node equipped with Shelley upgrade components was deployed onto the mainnet. By the month’s end, on July 29, the changes will be implemented on Cardano’s network through a hard fork. The  new Shelley upgrade  has had a significant impact on the ADA price because of its staking system. Cardano is a proof-of-stake network, which means there are no miners. Users, who run nodes, maintain the network by staking ADA. In return, users benefit from the reward system of Cardano. Cardano’s  Shelley roadmap reads : “Shelley will also see the introduction of a delegation and incentives scheme, a reward system to drive stake pools and community adoption. As a proof-of-stake network, users stake their ADA to participate in the network.” The roadmap also states that by the end of the Shelley upgrade, Cardano is expected to become more decentralized with upwards of 1,000 stake pools. It adds: “Come the end of the Shelley era, we expect Cardano to be 50-100 times more decentralized than other large blockchain networks, with the incentives scheme designed to reach equilibrium around 1,000 stake pools.” The growing demand for ADA likely stems from investors who find the reward system under Cardano’s new upgrade compelling. A breakout above a multi-year resistance level Since August 2018, the $0.107 level has acted as a strong multi-year resistance level for ADA. Every attempt to recover beyond it in September 2018 and June 2019 was met with a fierce sell-off. The last time ADA came close to testing the $0.107 level was during the first week of March, right before Bitcoin dropped to sub-$4,000. Within three weeks, the price of ADA fell by 71% from the local peak. ADA breaks out of a multi-year resistance level. Source:  TradingView.com The recent price spike of ADA marks the first breakout of the critical resistance level since 2018. The favorable market structure of ADA and the lack of clear resistance levels above $0.17 likely caught the attention of traders. The growth of the DeFi market The DeFi market on Ethereum is exploding, surpassing $2 billion in total value locked across all DeFi protocols. In a recent tweet, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  hinted  that Cardano could soon become a key player in the DeFi space. As a proof-of-stake blockchain network, the Cardano blockchain network is structurally efficient enough to handle large-scale DeFi applications. If Cardano evolves into the backbone of the DeFi space, it might present a  new growth opportunity  for the blockchain network in the medium-term.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/3-reasons-cardano-ada-suddenly-surged-by-85-in-10-days,cointelegraph,2020-07-08,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano Foundation Warns About Suspicious Activities in Japan ,"The Cardano Foundation — the organization behind major cryptocurrency Cardano ( ADA ) — warned that a suspicious firm is trying to rake in investments by claiming it has contacts with the foundation. On July 9, the foundation  stated  that someone claiming to be from or contracted by crypto exchange BTCNEXT professes to personally know the Cardano core members as a way to reassure that investments will be safe.  A BTCNEXT representative told Cointelegraph that the person in question does not have any relationship with the company. In fact, she said that they are familiar with the individual behind the claims and that the firm is on bad terms with him. Regardless, the Cardano Foundation makes plain that it has no links with the exchange: “Neither the Cardano Foundation nor any of its ecosystem partners are in any way associated with BTCNEXT, and they are also not our partners of any sort.” Cardano Foundation warns its community The Cardano Foundation further advised the community to “beware of any suspicious claims and conduct thorough due diligence.” It also urged individuals to refrain from sending any data to third parties that claim partnership with its team or other entities in its ecosystem, stating, “We will never ask you to send your funds (assets) to us.” The irreversible nature of cryptocurrency transactions makes crypto assets a popular choice among scammers, as in traditional financial systems, fraudsters have to take extra care to avoid transaction reversals or bank account bans. A recent report by major crypto exchange Binance illustrates that scammers often  go to great lengths to win the trust  of investors. For instance, some scammers even create false ""consumer organizations"" that squeeze victims for even more funds after they become suspicious that the organization is a scam.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-foundation-warns-about-suspicious-activities-in-japan,cointelegraph,2020-07-09,00:00:00,en
cardano,Markets,Cardano Creator Compares Criticism of Project to 'Trump Derangement Syndrome',"In his most recent video, Charles Hoskinson frets that massive egos and bitter conflicts threaten to undermine the cryptocurrency community. But, with a touch of Trumpian hyperbole, he suggests that journalists and rivals are trying to keep his project down. ""Are we being too overzealous with Cardano?"" the IOHK CEO mulls at the start of the  YouTube talk .  He's in a cluttered home study. Tribal masks leer down from the walls and a six-foot reprint of Jean-Leon Gerome's "" Pollice Verso""  with its vanquishing gladiator hangs to the left. Hoskinson leans forward on his desk, folding his arms: ""Let's be honest, as a community we've been really treated unfairly, we've been [urinated] on, [defecated] on, 'scam, scam, scam, scam, no working product' ... everything that could be said, has been said."" ""In particular, crypto media has got it wrong a lot,"" he says, looking directly at the camera.  For the past year, the chief of IOHK, the developer house for blockchain platform Cardano, has used YouTube extensively to communicate directly to his followers. Sometimes these videos are basic protocol updates or ""ask me anything"" sessions (AMAs). Other times it's to hit back at perceived criticism.  This week's animus surrounds a video that made the rounds on social media last week, which showed a marketing group promoting the Cardano project in a rural province of China. Both the Cardano project and Hoskinson said they have no affiliation with the group.  Shelley-shocked Similarly, Hoskinson talks about an article from industry news site Crypto Briefing that argued the upcoming launch of staking protocol Shelley would not suffice to give Cardano the edge it needs over rival blockchain platforms such as TRON or EOS. Following the article's publication, he took to  Twitter  to call Crypto Briefing a ""dumpster fire of a publication."" See also:  Cardano Developer IOHK Launches $20M Fund for Ecosystem Startups In this video, Hoskinson's head sways as he speaks, eyes still fixed on the camera. Journalists, podcasters and other influential figures, he says, have taken a definitive hard stance against Cardano; many of them won't retract what they've said because they're concerned about losing credibility with their audiences.  ""You know, this is where  Trump derangement syndrome  came from,"" Hoskinson says, pensively stroking his beard. The U.S. president is a ""horrible human being ... but everyone kinda just wrote him off and then, when he won, everyone went a little crazy about that and said we have to remediate this grievous mistake."" Hoskinson goes on: ""Well, similarly there is a bit of a Cardano derangement syndrome in the cryptocurrency space. People said our ideas will never work, we'll never deliver, we'll never actually ship anything, we've never actually accomplished anything. They just sometimes misrepresent reality completely."" The tempo rises. Cardano's been going for five years, he says. The critics have ignored everything the project has accomplished and a complex of rival project leads and media entities – he doesn't specify who – have never ceased calling it a scam or a fraud. Close to home Hoskinson's brows knit. The criticism is personal: ""How would you feel if someone came up to you and said: 'so when did you stop beating your wife? When did you stop being a child molester?'"" See also:   Coinbase Custody to Support Secure Cardano Staking This Year Still, he concedes, the digital asset industry has a serious problem with over-inflated egos and a lack of respect towards others. If this isn't addressed soon, he warns, then the Amazons and the Googles will swoop in and co-opt crypto for themselves.  In the spirit of reconciliation, he says Cardano will try harder to connect with other projects. Possibly even build some sort of cross-chain operability with Litecoin. ""It'll be fun project – they think about it, we think about it, why not?"" But that doesn't mean Hoskinson will ever stop speaking out publicly, especially when he feels ""my community"" is being attacked.  ""Every now and then I'm going to kick people in the teeth on Twitter, it's my style, I'm Italian, my grandmother's Italian. It's who I am, it's where I come from, it's how I think,"" he says.  ""I'll never apologize for kicking people in the teeth that call my community bad."" Talking to CoinDesk about the use of such strong rhetoric, Hoskinson said, while he may have said and done things that are ""counter-productive or regrettable,"" these came from the strain of ""operating in a low empathy medium where people don't even attempt to understand each other.""  Plus, what he considered unfair media coverage over the years, ""does create a bit of bitterness and disappointment."" In the end, Hoskinson said, ""You should never forget that these ecosystems aren't just protocols. They are people.""

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson's Cardano Giveaway Is Big Fat Scam,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson  has raised the alarm  about yet another giveaway scam that is making rounds on YouTube.   Scammers were running a now-removed YouTube live stream to trick viewers into sending them Cardano (ADA). The cryptocurrency’s founder described this as ‘disgusting and criminal.’ In order to add a flair of legitimacy to their video, they embedded the footage of Hoskinson’s conference keynote.  
 Over the past months,  U.Today has reported  about multiple other prominent personalities being unintentionally embroiled in such cryptocurrency giveaways -- from James Bond’s Danieal Craig to Tesla CEO Elon Musk. 
 
The latter turned out to be a cash cow for fraudsters following  SpaceX launching Falcon 9 . According to cyber-security firm Adaptiv, they managed to  rake in more than $2 million  by promoting numerous vanity addresses with the help of hijacked Youtube accounts.  A similar sham that involved Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates also pocketed a cool $100,000  back in March .  
 Last week, Hoskinson claimed that the Cardano Foundation  wasn’t associated  with an MLM scheme that was promoting ADA in China. Speaking of giveaway scammers, Hoskinson doesn’t rule taking legal action ‘against those responsible’ if it is possible. 
 
Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse  sued YouTube  in late April for not putting enough efforts into policing such ‘obvious scams.’",https://u.today/charles-hoskinsons-cardano-giveaway-is-big-fat-scam,utoday,2020-07-12,10:24:00,en
cardano, Market Analysis , Data Shows the ‘Cheaper Altcoins Make Higher Returns’ Myth Is Flawed ,"For many investors crypto trading remains a rags-to-riches affair where inexperienced investors hope to strike it rich by buying the cheapest priced altcoins like many novice traders did in 2017. Currently, the majority of traders do not expect Bitcoin ( BTC ) to pump 50% or more in a single week as $18,400 seems rather infeasible. On the other hand, many of these same investors are willing to put their hard-earned funds behind a lower cap, cheaper altcoins with the hopes that buying cheaper cryptocurrencies will lead to a higher return. A quick review of  CoinMarketCap's  index shows that 39 coins out of the top 60 were priced below $3 on July 12. Despite this, investors looking to make a quick return from the cheapest coins should think about the odds of picking winners. As previous years have shown, altcoins can gain relevance even when cryptocurrency markets remain reasonably stable by increasing their market share. These periods are commonly known as an altcoin season, and they can span from a few days to a couple of months. Bitcoin dominance drops set off altcoin rallies There isn't a clear definition of an altcoin season, although it typically involves a significant drop in Bitcoin dominance. A mere 3% reduction on the Bitcoin dominance chart entices $8 billion in valuation, shifting to the alternative cryptocurrencies' $100 billion market cap. By analyzing 15-day periods over the past year, one can find those moments of altcoin euphoria, which tend to happen either on bullish or neutral cryptocurrency trends. As Bitcoin loses significant support levels or face bearish trends, investors tend to avoid risk on altcoins, causing BTC dominance to increase. Previous altcoin seasons These four occasions leave a clear mark and the recent 2.2% drop to the current 63.8% dominance on July 11 came out close. Listed below are the highest BTC dominance drops in 15-day periods. Bitcoin dominance changes over 15-day periods. Source: Cointelegraph Bitcoin share on total market capitalization (dominance). Source:  TradingView The above chart shows four recent occasions when altcoins gained ground against Bitcoin's market capitalization. If the myth of the low-priced coins having a higher potential holds, one should see those outperforming the remaining altcoins during each of these altseasons. One should note that the outstanding number of coins mostly sets a cryptocurrency's unitary price. Founders can arbitrarily decide between thousands and billions of potential coins in circulation, thereby impacting its unitary price. BTC dominance dropped 4.8% from January 30 to February 14 2020 started strong for Bitcoin, moving to $9,330 level after a 30% run in January. The beginning of February was no different, and altcoins continued to rally until Bitcoin peaked near the $10,400 level. BTC dominance reached its lowest level in seven months, marking a massive altcoin rally. Best performers amongst sub-$3 coins. Source: Cointelegraph 26 of the 38 cryptocurrencies priced below $3 among the top 60 managed to outperform the 35.2% increase in altcoins market capitalization. That's a considerable 68% hit ratio favoring those low-priced coins. On the other hand, 16% finished the period 10% or more behind—still, a somewhat positive outcome for those betting on cheap cryptocurrencies. Altcoins total market capitalization. Source:  TradingView The chart above depicts the exact periods of altcoin exuberance, visualized by its market capitalization. The early February $109.4 billion peak clearly stands out, marking the highest level since July 2019. BTC dominance dropped 3.5% from Sept 6 to Sept 21 In early September 2019, Bitcoin was holding relatively steady at the $10,300 level, recovering from a  sub-10K dump . For some reason investors decided to increase their exposure in altcoins, causing BTC dominance to drop 3.5%. This could have been a technical adjustment as BTC dominance had increased to 73%, reaching its highest level since July 2017. Either way, investors signaled that they were more interested in altcoins at that moment, causing a 14.4% rally over the 15 day day period. Worst performers among the sub-$3 coins. Source: Cointelegraph Only 10 out of 42 managed to outpace altcoin market gains, while half managed to end the period 10% or more behind. One should note that Ether ( ETH ) managed to rise 25%,  EOS  rose 23%, and Dash ( DASH ) gained 21% during that same period. This time around, the low-priced coins strategy did not pan out. BTC dominance dropped 3.4% from Jan 7 to Jan 22 After spending the entire month of December drifting sideways, 2020 opened with Bitcoin moving from $7,175 to $8,800 in 15 days, but the digital asset  failed to break the $9,000  resistance. Altcoins were already moving strongly alongside the broader market and they pushed even further over the next week. The altcoin market cap hiked 24.7% in those 15 days, reaching $77.6 billion. Worst performers among the sub-$3 coins. Source: Cointelegraph Only 6 out of the 41 coins priced below $3 outperformed the broader altcoin market, a rather impressive 83% failure. 27 of those cheap cryptocurrencies finished the period lagging 10% or more. At the same time, Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) spiked 168%, Dash rose by 95%, ZCash ( ZEC ) gained 62%, and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) rallied 40%. BTC dominance dropped 2.7% from March 25 to April 9 March 12 will forever be remembered for Bitcoin's  50% price crash  in eight hours. Despite the partial recovery after the next few weeks, Bitcoin struggled to break the $7,000 level. Investors moved their attention to altcoins, whose market capitalization rallied an impressive 23.4% to $71.6 billion. Worst performers among the sub-$3 coins. Source: Cointelegraph Only 7 out of the 41 low priced coins managed to outperform broader altcoin market capitalization gain. On the other hand, 14 of them finished this period 10% or more behind. Buying the cheapest coins theory fails to hold up Over the past four periods of altcoins surges against Bitcoin’s price, the three cheapest coins managed to outperform in only one case. On average, 69% of those sub-$3 cryptocurrencies performed worse than the broader altcoin market. On average, 40% of the low-priced coins managed to finish those 15-day periods 10% or more behind altcoin market capitalization gains. Therefore, it’s safe to say that buying the lower-priced cryptocurrencies are not the best option for an investor to choose during an altcoin rally. Although it is possible to find strategies to optimize returns using cheap altcoins during altcoin seasons, this arbitrary indicator alone does not produce higher returns than the broader altcoin market.

cardano, News , Messari CEO: Cardano Has ‘Plenty of Room for Growth’ ,"After Cardano surged to become sixth-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap last week, Messari co-founder and CEO Ryan Selkis still believes traders could buy and stake more of the altcoin. In his newsletter, Seliks said lower staking rates for Cardano ( ADA ) could mean a higher reward payout for investors who are “wondering if they’re late to the party.”  The Messari co-founder says one of the catalysts for the  token’s recent surge   — up 85% as of July 8 — is Shelley, an upcoming possible hardfork upgrading its ecosystem. “The potential discrepancy between staked and un-staked ADA however, could bode well for bulls even after Shelley goes live. While the initial staking percentage won't be known until after launch, Cardano's incentivized testnet saw participation from ~40% of the reported supply. If this carries over to mainnet, Cardano's staking rates will be significantly lower than other large-cap networks like Tezos (80%) and Cosmos (71%).” Selkis says this means there is plenty of room for growth in ADA as investors pursue lower staking rates to buy and stake on exchanges. Following an announcement that  ADA holders will be able to stake their assets  in Coinbase custody by Q4 2020, speculation arose that the crypto exchange might soon list Cardano. The altcoin currently trades for $0.13.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/messari-ceo-cardano-has-plenty-of-room-for-growth,cointelegraph,2020-07-13,00:00:00,en

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, ADA, LINK, XLM, VET, DGTX* ","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) tight range has put analysts in a fix, meaning, every bit of data is being analyzed to determine the direction of the impending breakout. Bitcoin options open interest data can provide some clues on what the larger investors are expecting but there are many other factors at play that could influence Bitcoin’s spot price. Currently, the maximum  open interest  buildup in calls is at the $11,000 strike price and in puts at the $8,000 strike price. This suggests that the writers of these options do not believe that these levels are likely to be breached by expiry.  Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 The immediate support is at the $9,000 strike price where there is an open interest buildup of 2,042.4 put options. On the upside, the $9,500 strike price has open interest buildup of 1,056.3 call options.  This suggests that the number of options buyers who believe that the price of  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap will not break below $9,000 is more than traders who do not expect the price to rise above $9,500, which is a mild positive. BTC options data largely supports the view that the price could remain range-bound until the expiry. However, in case the price breaks out with force, options sellers will be forced to cover their positions and this could add fuel to Bitcoin’s price action. BTC/USD The range in Bitcoin ( BTC ) has tightened in the past few days, which suggests that both the bulls and the bears are waiting on the sidelines for a trending move to start before jumping in to initiate a position.  BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView While the range-bound action has been talked about for many days, the biggest question is which way the breakout will happen. The directional movement index (DMI) indicator can be used to identify whether the bulls or the bears have the upper hand. Along with it, the average directional movement index (ADX) can be used to see when the trend is likely to pick up steam. In the BTC/USD pair, history suggests that the ADX starts a strong trending move when it is close to 10.80 levels (marked as ellipses on the chart). Currently, the ADX is at 17.92, which suggests that the range-bound action might continue for a few more days and the ADX can drop further before the price breaks out decisively. The -DI (colored red) is currently dominant as it is on top and the +DI (colored green) is at the bottom, which suggests that the bears have a slight edge over the bulls.  If the price breaks below the immediate support at $8,900 and the ADX pushes above 25, it will increase the possibility of a deeper pullback. If the price rises from the current levels and breaks above $9,500 with a rally that pushes the ADX above 25, it will signal the possibility of a sustained up-move. There are two critical things for traders to watch is the ADX level as it will indicate a possible sustained trend above 25 and the dominant DI. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The price is trading below both moving averages and the downtrend line, suggesting that bears have a slight edge. The immediate support on the downside is at $9,089.17 and below that at $9,040.48.  If these supports crack, the bears will try to break below the psychological level of $9,000 and challenge the support at $8,900. If the price turns up and breaks out of the downtrend line, it will suggest accumulation by the bulls and could result in a move to $9,345.05 and possibly $9,500. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) is in a strong uptrend with the ADX above 40. The altcoin has currently formed a symmetrical triangle, which mostly acts as a continuation pattern with the price generally breaking out in the direction of the prevailing trend.  ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The uptrend will resume after the bulls push the price above the symmetrical triangle and the recent high at $0.1380977. Above this level, the  sixth-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap can rally to $0.173 and then to $0.20. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the triangle, the 20-day exponential moving average ($0.114) is likely to act as a strong support but if it cracks, a deeper correction to the 50-day simple moving average ($0.094) is possible.  ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The ADA/USD pair is currently below both moving averages and the -DI has become dominant, which suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback in the short-term. A break below the triangle will be a negative sign as it could result in profit booking by the short-term traders. There is a minor support at $0.11 but if this support cracks, a deeper correction is possible. Hence, bottom fishing can be avoided if the price sustains below the triangle. Conversely, if the price bounces off the support line of the triangle and the bulls push the price above the 50-SMA, it will indicate strength. Above this, a retest of the resistance line of the triangle is possible. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the triangle is likely to resume the uptrend and could be an opportunity for the traders to consider long positions. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) is in a strong uptrend with the ADX above the 54 level. However, after the sharp up move of the past few days, the altcoin is currently witnessing profit booking. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Usually, in a strong uptrend, the pullback lasts for one to three days. If the up move does not resume after a three-day correction, chances of a deeper pullback or a consolidation increase. The  eighth-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has support at $7.3144 and $6.8221, which are the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent leg of the up move. The 20-day EMA ($6.75) is also close by and this zone is likely to act as a strong support. If the price bounces off this zone, it could offer an opportunity to the traders to establish long positions if they expect the uptrend to continue.  LINK/USD 4-hour chart.

A break below the 50-SMA could attract further selling by the short-term traders, which could result in a deeper correction to $6.8221.  However, if the LINK/USD pair rebounds off the 50-SMA and bounces above the downtrend line and $8.2241, it will be the first indication of strength.

cardano,Business,BitGo Now Supports Custody and Staking of Tezos’ XTZ,"BitGo has added custodial and staking services for the Tezos blockchain’s native token,  XTZ . Investors who store their XTZ with BitGo will earn an annual staking return of around 6% across BitGo’s hot and cold wallets, the custodial firm told CoinDesk on Thursday. Cryptos native to proof-of-stake consensus blockchains generate returns for their holders as a reward for them lending their personal computing power (or that of a delegated validator, such as BitGo Trust) toward securing the network.  Upon  entering the staking space  in October 2019, BitGo added support for proof-of-stake tokens  dash  and algo. XTZ’s market cap of around $2.4 billion at press time dwarfs those tokens. BitGo intends to add custodial support for Tezos blockchain-based tokens in the coming months, the firm said.

cardano, News , IOHK and BeefChain Team Up to Answer ‘Where’s the Beef?’ ,"The team behind Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, IOHK, have partnered with Wyoming-based BeefChain to utilize blockchain technology to improve food traceability and security. IOHK, which relocated to Wyoming in 2019,  announced  the partnership at the Cardano 2020 virtual event. Chief Commercial Officer Jerry Fragiskatos stated the solution will benefit both consumers and producers by tackling issues including food safety and recalls. The partnership will utilize DLT to standardize the tracking and recording processes for beef products along the supply chain from ranches to markets. BeefChain President Steven Lupien said it will result in a range of benefits across certification, traceability and consumer engagement: “Our [BeefChain’s] partnership with IOHK brings state-of-the-art technology to ranchers […] We are not technologists [and] IOHK is providing the backbone to our system and it is secured, transparent, and scalable. IOHK has provided everything we needed and more.” By partnering with IOHK, BeefChain will be better able to certify ranchers via a process verified program (PVP) which focuses on quality assurance metrics like grass-fed and zero hormone treatment beef products. RFID tag data will be stored on Cardano. Lupien said consumers will receive QR code with the beef, linking them to information on the web about the beef and the ranch that produced it. “[Our] Consumer product is there to enhance the consumer experience and to help educate the consumer about where their product comes from [...] back to the rancher where you can meet the ranching family that’s producing your product.” The benefit are understood Wyoming State Representative and BeefChain program manager Tyler Lindholm emphasized blockchain’s ability to reduce supply chain costs — for example, cutting down the time of a recall from days to seconds. He said that Walmart’s FoodTrust program had reduced a 6 day recall procedure down to 2.5 seconds and cut the cost of each recall by millions: “As soon as they found out how quick they could do it, they immediately told all their producers, they don’t really have a choice and they need to transition immediately to their new system. So that was good for blockchain, that’s good for food safety and good for traceability.” Australia is also fighting beef fraud Australian beef tracing blockchain platform BeefLedger are another company who have understood the potential of DLT within the supply chain sector. Based in Australia they focus on food safety and fraud issues particularly for exports to China. According to Beijing-based industry expert Ian Lahiffe, for every 1kg of genuine beef sold in China, there’s 3kg of beef that’s not from the country claimed.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/iohk-and-beefchain-team-up-to-answer-wheres-the-beef,cointelegraph,2020-07-23,00:00:00,en
cardano, Analysis , Crypto Scammer on the Prowl as YouTube and Twitter Become Central to Bitcoin Scams ,"Over the years, it has become a known fact for anyone dealing with cryptocurrencies that scams are running rampant. However, as more novice players enter the market, more scammers up their tactics to take advantage of unsuspecting Bitcoin enthusiasts with fake Bitcoin giveaways and other elaborate schemes.  Recently, a  new bout of scammers  has emerged with even more sophisticated and aggressive tactics. As evident through most reports, the scammers are taking advantage of popular social media platforms like YouTube and Twitter to capture their victims. For instance, on July 13 Charles Hoskinson who is the founder of Cardano  warned about a YouTube account  that has been promoting fake giveaways of Cardano ( ADA ). Most recently a  sizable attack targeting high profile twitter accounts  has exposed the inherent security risks on major social media platforms. As Cointelegraph reported, potentially thousands of people got scammed out of their Bitcoin after several prominent and verified twitter accounts were hacked to promote a fake Bitcoin giveaway. The scammers managed to reach an estimated 350 million people making away with about $110,000 in a matter of hours. In almost every twitter account belonging to a prominent individual, the audience was encouraged to send $1,000 in Bitcoin to a specified address to receive $2,000 as a free giveaway. YouTube falls captive Apart from Twitter, YouTube has also proven itself to be one of the  favorite tools for scammers. According to a report published on July 10 by  Whale Alert , one scam project that operated in June 2020, made away with more than $120,000 in a day by using a single-page website and YouTube advertising to lure unsuspecting victims.  Cardano’s CEO, Charles Hoskinson warned against scams promoting fake Cardano giveaways on YouTube. In a tweet, the founder of Cardano said that “a scam has been floating around using my conference keynote to promote a giveaway,” he added: “This is a scam. Please report it to YouTube. We will take legal action if we can against those responsible.” Although YouTube has since deleted the video, Hoskinson retweeted that there were still YouTube adverts promoting the scams. Ripple’s CEO Brad Garlinghouse  has also been targeted by impersonators who hack and rename YouTube channels as “XRP Giveaways” eventually fleecing millions from unwitting XRP holders. In response, Ripple has filed a lawsuit against YouTube for allegedly profiting from the actions of the scammers while having the ability to stop them. In another case of  scams on YouTube,  a number of victims were lured into a pyramid scheme in early June after promises of a possible 200% payback for their bitcoin donation to a YouTube account named “SpaceX.” According to reports, the scammer managed to get away with 15.3 BTC. Bleeping Computer  reports  that the scammers operate by hacking existing youtube channels, changing their channel name to SpaceX and publishing archived footage of Elon Musk (or any other public figure) to make it look like Musk’s archived speeches are live. While the legitimate SpaceX channel has over 4 million subscribers, two of the channels hijacked by the scammers had 130,000 subscribers and 230,000 subscribers thereby giving the viewers the appearance of a legitimate following. Each of the fake SpaceX channels asked its viewers to send bitcoin to a specified address.  To further promote the fake youtube live streams to a wider audience the scammers used bots to scale up the number of viewers on the live streams thus giving an impression to the YouTube algorithm of a viral video.  With a combination of socially engineered tricks and boosted viewership from bots, the scammers managed to get their videos on top of youtube searches especially for keywords related to prominent individuals like Jack Ma and Elon Musk. Even though YouTube has since responded by taking down hacked channels that promoted the scams. Whale Alert reports that giveaway scams find it easy to use the identities of celebrities to lure large audiences with the help of tools such as YouTube advertising. An affiliated service Scam Alert has reported that since the start of the year, the outfit reports that more than 20 million in Bitcoin has been stolen. The Scam Market is evolving As it seems, scammers are using increasingly aggressive tactics in the form of fake companies with dozens of websites and fake social media accounts to promote their schemes. Dominik Scheiner, the co-founder of the IOTA foundation told Cointelegraph: ""These Crypto Scams on social media have become a lot more sophisticated and aggressive over the last few months. The fact that they are continuing, clearly shows that these scams are working.” True to Schiener’s concerns, Whale Alert reports that prominent Giveaway scams that feature celebrities like Elon Musk as well popular exchanges can net upwards of $300,000 US dollars. As scammers increasingly change their methods by using professional teams to increase the quality of their attacks, experts warn that it is just a matter of time before ‘deep fake’ techniques are introduced to the scam market. Last year, Jack Dorsey’s  account was hacked  amid assurances from Twitter that the flaw was fixed. The recent bout of attacks, however, reveals that there are still many vulnerabilities on the platform. As to the reason why Twitter and YouTube are attractive tools for scammers, Schiener believes it’s due to their popularity: “A comment on a popular tweet or YouTube video might be seen by thousands of people, making it easier to succeed with these scams. Also, nearly all social media platforms today lack better moderation tools and policies.” According to Schiener popular social media platforms cannot get rid of fake or harmful content and unless these platforms implement “better content moderation tools, these scams will only increase and further evolve.” Alternative solutions? With the U.S. presidential elections fast approaching, tight security measures on all major social media platforms are needed more than ever. Schiener mentioned that the recent bout of scams showcased that digital identities with verifiable credentials based on a distributed chain are a real way to fight back. With a DLT identity and verification system, Schiener explains that it is impossible to “impersonate another person’s identity or fake a credential” as the data is immutable and verifiable using KYC systems. The notion of self-sovereign identity and verification systems are designed to give the user control over their information. Self-sovereign identity offers a solution to standard identity verification systems that cluster a user’s information on central servers creating massive vulnerabilities. However, by placing self-sovereign identity and verification systems on a DLT, centralized, external and third-party control is removed thereby reducing the risk of widespread data breaches.  Despite the optimism around the transformative potential of DLT based identity verification systems, experts reveal that less than 10% of apps are  expected  to take on DLT solutions by 2023. Even though there are existing solutions and the sector has an  estimated  yearly growth of 35%, adoption is still slow. Some of the immediate solutions that social media platforms such as Youtube can adopt for now include, training its users on the platforms security risks. Also, YouTube can continuously monitor accounts on its platform to identify and stop any suspicious activity. Scams revealing a rise in retail investors The recent bout of hacks on YouTube has obviously eroded the trust of its users on the platform's security. However, beyond the loss of trust, YouTube will likely face legal consequences given that the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requires companies of its caliber to have top-notch security levels. In the past, other social media sites such as Facebook have also been called to attention to tighten their security and community management tools. Already, YouTube is facing a  lawsuit from Ripple’s CEO  Brad Garlinghouse and the company’s attorneys for its failure to stop scammers and impersonators while benefiting from adverts that promote scams. So far, YouTube has responded that it is not liable for crypto scams perpetrated by third parties. As the crypto scam market grows, its impact on people’s lives is increasingly becoming substantial. For most crypto and blockchain enthusiasts, scams have been their first introduction to the industry as the unregulated nature of the sector leaves room for scammers to go about unchecked. Schiener suggests that the pandemic might have had a hand in giving rise to cybercrime in general as lockdowns around the world left many people out of work: “This meant that they had to work from less secure work environments and generally spend more time online. This gave scammers an obvious opportunity to increase their efforts.” Additionally, Schiener opines that the rise in crypto scams could also be a signal indicating a rise in retail investors joining the crypto sphere. He adds, “Since many of these new investors are more novice, it’s much easier to trick them into a giveaway or more elaborate phishing schemes.""",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-scammer-on-the-prowl-as-youtube-and-twitter-become-central-to-bitcoin-scams,cointelegraph,2020-07-23,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Launches Countdown to Conducting Shelley Upgrade Early Next Week,"Several hours ago, the Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson conducted  a live stream on YouTube , announcing the final stage of preparations for the upcoming Shelley hard fork, saying that after this Cardano is going to be the best crypto platform on the market. The new testnet  (and a release candidate for the mainnet) is called MC3 and Cardano has begun the countdown to the hard fork. It will be conducted in five days, on July 29. In the video, Charles Hoskinson stated that even though, the whole team has been working really hard recently, with many people working weekends, to deploy the new mainnet, find and eliminate any bugs, over the weekend developers and the QA team will be working even harder to go through the checklists, identify and solve any issues before Shelley is rolled out on July 29. Hoskinson said that so far everything is so good: “the sky is blue, the weather is good and we are counting down towards launch.” 
 
 The Cardano founder said that the upcoming upgrade is the most profound in the history of the project, since it is taking the platform from a static and federated Byron network into Shelley, which is dynamic and decentralized. Hoskinson pointed out that the project’s team after that will be able to deliver the promises that Bitcoin made in 2009. Cardano was started as a system that could evolve over time to meet the needs of billions of people and provide an economic identity to those billions of people, always getting more decentralized and always getting faster, more capable, etc, he stated. He promised a lot more things to come on Cardano – smart contracts, native assets, overlay protocols, etc. According to Hoskinson, after the update is implemented, Cardano will be the best cryptocurrency on the market compared to Bitcoin. As soon as native assets and smart contracts are launched on the network, Cardano will be the best cryptocurrency compared to all the rest of crypto, he emphasized. As for the Cardano team and Hoskinson himself, they will take August as a well-deserved rest after the hard work they have done over the past several months.",https://u.today/cardano-launches-countdown-to-conducting-shelley-upgrade-early-next-week,utoday,2020-07-25,11:30:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, ETH, ADA, XMR, CRO ","The total crypto market capitalization has reached  $300 billion  for the first time since mid-February, which is a huge positive as it suggests increased investor interest in cryptocurrencies. The interest has largely been in smaller altcoins with Bitcoin ( BTC ) taking a back seat until early this morning.  Even Ether ( ETH ) recently joined the  altseason party  and once it broke out of its resistance the price skyrocketed higher. This could have resulted in a missed opportunity for several traders who did not buy on the breakout.  Now, traders are likely to expect a similar move from the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap as it has also been range-bound for a long time. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Therefore, several bulls are likely to start buying Bitcoin without waiting for it to breakout and  short positions  are likely to cover, which could provide the needed push to carry the price above the stiff overhead resistance. As the momentum picks up, there could be a buying stampede as traders fear missing out on the rally.  The upcoming week is critical as it will provide insight into whether the altcoins will continue to lead the market or if Bitcoin will join in and shift traders’ focus away from altcoins.  BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke above the $10,100 level today for the first time since early-June, which is likely to boost sentiment. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight as they will aggressively defend the $10,000–$10,400 resistance zone. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Currently, the price has dipped back below the $10,000 levels but the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that minor dips are being purchased. This change in sentiment increases the possibility of a break above the $10,400 resistance. If the price sustains above $10,400, it could result in short covering and aggressive buying by the bulls. Such a move could quickly carry the price to $11,870.50, which is the pattern target of the breakout from the bullish ascending triangle pattern. A breakout and close (UTC time) above $10,400 will also complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $16,997. However, this target is likely to be achieved in the medium-term as the bears will aggressively defend the $14,000 levels. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the trendline of the ascending triangle.  BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The price is currently consolidating between the $9,800–$10,000 level, which is a positive sign. If the bulls can again push the price above $10,000 and sustain the higher levels for four hours, a move to $10,400 levels is likely. A break above this level will be a huge positive and could result in a sharp move higher. This bullish view will be invalidated in the short-term if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-exponential moving average. Such a move will indicate that the momentum has weakened and could lead to a minor consolidation. ETH/USD After consolidating for about two months, Ether ( ETH ) broke above the $253.556–$216.006 range on July 22. This breakout attracted buying by the bulls who had been waiting on the sidelines for the up move to resume. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The aggressive buying quickly pushed the  second-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap to the first target level of $320. The relative strength index has risen above the 80 levels, which suggests that the rally has become overbought in the short-term. As the price is close to a stiff resistance, profit booking by the short-term traders is possible, which could result in a minor correction or consolidation. In a strong uptrend, the pullbacks usually last for one to three days, after which the uptrend resumes. If the bulls can propel the price above $320, the next level to watch out for is $366.  ETH/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the ETH/USD pair did not even correct to the 20-EMA after breaking above $253.556. The RSI has been trading in the overbought range, which suggests that the trend is very strong. If the bears can sink the price below $300, a drop to the 20-EMA is possible. A bounce off this support will indicate that the bulls continue to view the dips as a buying opportunity. The uptrend is likely to pick up momentum once again if the price closes (UTC time) above $320. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the price below the 20-EMA, the pair could consolidate for a few days. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) broke above the symmetrical triangle and made a new 52-week high, which indicates that the uptrend is strong and the bulls continue to buy at higher levels as they expect the rally to extend further.  ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Usually, after breaking out of a pattern, the price retests the breakout levels but If the trend is strong only a consolidation occurs.  Currently, the  sixth-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap is facing profit booking at $0.1543051, which could result in a minor correction or consolidation.  If the price rebounds off $0.13 aggressively, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move and extend the rally to $0.173 and then to $0.20. This bullish up move will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.12.  ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the ADA/USD pair picked up momentum after breaking out of the triangle and surged to $0.1543051 levels, which pushed the RSI deep into the overbought zone. History suggests that the pair corrects when the RSI rises above the 80 levels. The current pullback is likely to find support at the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this level will indicate strength and increase the possibility of the resumption of the uptrend. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) had been consolidating between $60–$70 for two months. This range resolved to the upside with a breakout and close (UTC time) above $70 on July 22, which suggests that the bulls have overpowered the bears. XMR/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The immediate target of the breakout from the range was $80 and the price had reached a high of $79.10 today. The bears might now attempt to pull the price back into the range, hence, a retest of the $70 levels is possible.  If the  16th-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap rebounds off this support, then it will act as a new floor and signal the possible start of a new uptrend. The first target on the upside is $85 and if the momentum can scale this level, then the rally could reach $95. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears drag the price back below $70. XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages on the 4-hour chart are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The XMR/USD pair had reached overbought levels on the RSI, hence, a minor correction or consolidation is possible. The first support on the downside is likely to be the 20-EMA. A strong rebound off this level could offer an entry opportunity to the traders but if this support breaks, it could signal a deeper pullback to $70. CRO/USD Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) is in a strong uptrend as it continues to make higher highs and higher lows. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, suggesting that bulls are in command. CRO/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls have pushed the  ninth-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap above the $0.15306–$0.15416 resistance zone. If the price closes (UTC time) above this zone, it will increase the possibility of a move to $0.174114 and then to $0.20. However, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above the resistance zone, a minor correction or consolidation is possible. The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($0.143).  CRO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the CRO/USD pair dips when the RSI rises close to 75 levels. The first level to watch out for is $0.15306 and below that the 20-EMA, which usually acts as a strong support when the trend is strong. However, if the bears sink the price below both these supports, then a drop to the 50-simple moving average and below that to $0.14 is possible.

cardano, News , Hoskinson AMA Reveals Details of Cardano Foray into Africa ,"Charles Hoskinson, CEO of Cardano ( ADA ) developers IOHK, took to YouTube on July 25 for one of his regular ask-me-anything  sessions . Among a wide range of topics covered, Hoskinson gave details about the status of a number of tenders aimed at making inroads into Africa. Can’t win ‘em all Hoskinson admitted that IOHK had been underbid on its primary tender, to facilitate a fertilizer voucher scheme for farmers with Ethiopia’s Agricultural Transformation Agency, or ATA. This was despite putting in what he felt was an incredibly low bid himself. “It was crazy because we thought the contract would cost $500,000 to do. But I really wanted it so I bid $100,000, and somebody came in with like a $35,000 bid.” Hoskinson felt that there was no way that the winning company could break even on such a low bid, speculating that there would be some renegotiation on the back end. This could potentially open the door for IOHK to later get involved as a subcontractor, he hoped. A game of numbers Hoskinson explained that the tendering process was a game of numbers, bidding on multiple contracts at the same time, and was confident that IOHK would win contracts in time. “We’re also bidding on a telecommunications contract, and we’re bidding on a transportation contract, and there’s a few other things that we’re tendering just on the Ethiopian side. But we’re also looking at a pan-African view.” He went on to say that eventually they would be servicing hundreds of deals per year, and each one would bring hundreds of thousands or millions of people into the Cardano ecosystem. Partnership with telco in Tanzania Hoskinson did announce a previously undisclosed deal with World Mobile in Tanzania. The company is working with 4G mesh networks and setting up micro ISPs. IOHK has been working with World Mobile for some time, he said, and would be making an official announcement soon, but it had taken some time for the company to get the resources needed to deploy. Cardano has been seeing  impressive price action  over the past few months, following the announcement and subsequent initiation of the “Shelley” upgrade.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/hoskinson-ama-reveals-details-of-cardano-foray-into-africa,cointelegraph,2020-07-27,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Bitrue Is First Exchange to Support Cardano’s Shelley Hard Fork,"The Bitrue team has published an  article on its blog , saying that the crypto exchange is prepared to integrate support for the Cardano hard fork scheduled for July 29 and will be the first platform to support Shelley. As was detailed in the article, Bitrue will be among the first platforms to support the Shelley upgrade for Cardano — long expected by its users. This will enable Bitrue to offer its customers seven percent APR (annual percentage rate) in 30-day lockup plans soon enough — from mid-August. Cardano will implement staking after the Shelley launch, according to its roadmap. However, the exchange is already able to offer its customers to stake their ADA at a smaller APR via its own programs. On Wednesday, July 29, at 12:30 p.m. UTC, when the Cardano upgrade begins to activate, Bitrue will suspend all ADA withdrawals and deposits by its customers. According to  a video  posted by Cardano’s founder, Charles Hoskinson, on YouTube over the weekend, the upcoming Shelley upgrade is going to make this platform completely decentralized by allowing a lot of operators to govern and maintain the network. It means that nobody will be able to manipulate or control Cardano and its native currency, ADA. The upgrade will also allow for the emergence of ADA staking pools. Besides, Hoskinson stated that after the hard fork on Cardano, native assets, smart contracts and other interesting projects will appear based on it.

cardano,Markets,Coinbase Now Offers 2% Rewards on Dai Stablecoin Accounts,"U.S.-based crypto exchange Coinbase has launched a  rewards program  for customers holding the  dai  stablecoin from popular DeFi project Maker.  Coinbase said Wednesday that users holding more than 1 dai will see returns at 2% annual percentage yield (APY).  The program applies to customers residing in the U.S., U.K., The Netherlands, Spain, France and Australia.  Rewards are to be distributed within the first five business days of receiving dai in a Coinbase account and will be handed out daily after the first payout. Coinbase has a  similar program  for U.S. customers that rewards users based on the amount of USDC held in their exchange wallets. Staking rewards are also offered on  tezos (XTZ)  holdings. The exchange already rewards users for interacting with educational content with dai as part of the Coinbase Earn project. Dai-issuer MakerDAO is the biggest platform in decentralized finance (DeFi). Earlier this week, the total value of cryptocurrency locked into the platform  crossed $1 billion  – a first for any DeFi project. Maker itself offers interest on holdings of dai, however Coinbase said the rewards scheme is a promotion funded by itself.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Achieves Full Decentralization by Successfully Completing Shelley Hard Fork,"Cardano has officially completed the Shelley hard fork that kicks off a new era for the $3.6 bln blockchain project. 
 
The fork took place at 21:44:51 UTC without involving a chain split or token swap, meaning that the ADA cryptocurrency will remain the same. The ""Shelley"" upgrade, named after English Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley, marks a major milestone for Cardano since it is supposed to make its blockchain completely decentralized. As  reported by U.Today , Cardano launched an incentivized testnet that rewards users for staking ADA. 
 
In early July,  a Shelley-complete node  was deployed on the Cardano mainnet after the public testnet was released on June 9. From now on, all ADA holders are able to lock their funds in the Daedalus or Yoroi wallets to receive rewards that are distributed by the end of each epoch. According to the announcement shared with U.Today, there are now 481 staking pools. Cardano is expected to reach about 1,000 of them in the future, which would make it up to 100 times more decentralized than competing blockchain networks. 
 
During his recent  YouTube live stream , IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson touted the upgrade as ""a giant leap forward"" for the project. 
 
With the rollout of Goguen, the next era that will introduce smart contracts, Hoskinson claims that Cardano will become better than Bitcoin: From here on out. Cardano is the best cryptocurrency on the market when we think about it compared to Bitcoin, and as soon as we get native assets and smart contracts, we're the best cryptocurrency bar none.

cardano,Tech,Cardano Introduces Proof-of-Stake With 'Shelley' Hard Fork,"It's alive! Cardano's blockchain has undergone a momentous transformation. Announced Wednesday, the open-source smart-contract platform designed to challenge Ethereum's lead position hard forked from the centralized Byron network into the decentralized Shelley network. The team behind Cardano's transformation is blockchain research and development   startup IOHK https://iohk.io/en/projects/cardano/team/ . IOHK's CEO Charles Hoskinson said Cardano has been carefully developed over five years and ""hundreds"" of assets are expected to be running on the blockchain in a year's time. According to a press release, Shelley will increase ""security and robustness,"" while enabling more blockchain use cases. The upgrade will utilize  the Ouroboros  consensus algorithm – a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol leveraging cryptography,  combinatorics  and mathematical game theory. By implementing Shelley on Cardano's mainnet, staking pools will now be able to register on the chain visible to token holders, enabling them to delegate to pools immediately once registered. The PoS delegation process lets users holding Cardano's native  ADA  token commit their tokens to a pool for a share of rewards, which the company said will incentivize the network to run ""accurately."" Cardano will reach consensus equilibrium once 1,000 stake pools have been established, 485 of which are currently live.  IOHK said Shelley represents a ""first step"" in a series of enhancements to the network over the coming months with expectations that its Project Catalyst will launch by year's end. Catalyst will introduce a governance model enabling the Cardano community to cast votes on the direction of the blockchain, including software updates, technical improvements and the long-term future of the network.

cardano, News , Vitalik Buterin: Future Lotteries Could Benefit From ETH 2.0’s Randomness ,"Discussing Ethereum’s ( ETH ) hackathon in partnership with the Colorado State Lottery, Vitalik Buterin opined that in the future, such lotteries could benefit from Ethereum 2.0’s Verifiable Delay Function. No immediate use for Ethereum in the project The Ethereum creator will be one of the guests at the  virtual opening ceremony  for the Colorado State Lottery GameJam Hackathon. Jared Polis and Chainlink’s co-founder, Sergey Nazarov, will also be inattendance. Buterin does not believe that the Colorado Lottery will immediately start using the Ethereum blockchain for its games of chance, but suspects similar applications may utilize ETH 2.0’s randomness functions in the future: “My understanding is that there isn't really an Ethereum tie-in to the lottery itself; rather, it's part of Jared Polis's administration's efforts to look at innovative approaches in funding public goods and modernizing government. I do think that potentially in the future applications like these could benefit from Ethereum 2.0's randomness though, when we add the VDF!” Chainlink believes that its Verifiable Randomness Function, or VRF,  holds a lot of potential for the gaming industry  as well. In the future, this could be a source of competition between the decentralized ecosystems. Discussing the partnership's overlap with Ethereum’s 5th birthday, Buterin said: “I think it’s a coincidence! I don't think the State of Colorado is making decisions based on Ethereum dates yet...” There is no state-by-state competition between Ethereum and Cardano Colorado’s neighboring state of  Wyoming is perhaps the most crypto friendly in the United States . It has also seemingly been claimed by Ethereum competitor, Cardano ( ADA ), as they project’s home turf. Cardano’s development company  IOHK moved its legal headquarters from Hong Kong to Wyoming  when the state passed its crypto-friendly legislation. Cardano also  has close ties with the University of Wyoming  and a number of local businesses. Ironically,  founder of Cardano and co-founder of Ethereum, Charles Hoskinson  lives in Boulder Colorado. We asked Buterin whether Ethereum was trying to lay claim to Colorado, to which he stated: “I don't really like to think of it in terms of ""this state is our turf, this other state is their turf."" There's certainly a very strong Ethereum presence in Colorado, but in general Colorado has smart people, they'll use the tech that makes sense for them, and I'm confident that Ethereum will prove valuable in lots of locations.” It will be interesting to observe how blockchain technology is used outside of its regular environment in future. If it is able to help the Lottery achieve its revenue goal of $1 billion, it could mean big things for the proliferation of Blockchain.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-future-lotteries-could-benefit-from-eth-20s-randomness,cointelegraph,2020-07-31,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Cardano ‘Dwarfs’ Tezos After Shelley Hard Fork, Says Security Auditor ","Quantstamp, a company that has been auditing Cardano’s ( ADA ) code base for the past two months, believes that  after the Shelley hard fork , Cardano will trail only Ethereum ( ETH ) as a smart contract platform, dwarfing its arch-rival Tezos ( XTZ ). Cardano’s code base “one of the best” Quantstamp CEO Richard Ma told Cointelegraph that in his opinion, Cardano has some of the best code in all of the blockchain space. He believes it is on par with ETH 2.0’s Prysm: “It’s clear they’ve put a lot of internal effort to solidly test and properly engineer the code and it’s really shown through the smooth launch. We also recently audited prysm from eth 2.0 and we would say that in terms of quality, similar to prysm, it is one of the best codebases we have seen.” Discussing the recent Shelley hard fork, Quantstamp communications manager, Jaye Harrill, told Cointelegraph that by the end of 2020, they expect Cardano to be second only to Ethereum in popularity as a smart contract platform. Harrill also feels that Cardano “dwarfs” Tezos as a proof-of-stake blockchain: “The move to the Shelley era means Cardano will be the second most popular smart contract platform, second only to Ethereum by the end of the year. As a proof of stake system, it now dwarfs Tezos.” Hoskinson: Smart contracts and native assets are coming soon Earlier today, replying to  EOS  founder Daniel Larimer on Twitter, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stated that by the end of the year, smart contracts and native assets are coming to the platform along with low latency: Source:  Twitter .

cardano,No Section,Bitfinex Announces Cardano’s ADA Listing Following Successful Shelley Upgrade,"In a press release shared with U.Today, the  Cardano Foundation announced  that its native cryptocurrency. ADA, is finally going to be listed on the major global exchange, Bitfinex. The team also spread the word about it on their Twitter page. The press release says that trading ADA-based pairs will start later today, August 6. It will begin with three spot trading pairs: ADA/BTC, ADA/USD and ADA/USDT. By opening access to ADA via USD, Bitfinex promises to become one of the easiest platforms on which to buy ADA without having to purchase any other crypto. Bitfinex CTO Paolo Ardoino has called the listing of ADA a major natural step for the company since they have always wanted to offer ADA to their customers. About a week ago, on July 31, Cardano finally rolled out the long-awaited Shelley code upgrade. This hard fork opens the way for the adoption of smart contracts, dapps and full decentralization in the future. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson stated that, after Shelley, ADA will be the best cryptocurrency out there since it will finally be able to offer users what Bitcoin promised initially but never delivered on. As  reported by U.Today  on Thursday, the Weiss Crypto Ratings agency also commented on this event. Its analyst stated that the rollout of Shelley has not changed the high rating given to Cardano by the agency. However, if Cardano achieves increased usage and gets its fundamentals improved thanks to Shelley, then the platform’s rating is likely to be updated.",https://u.today/bitfinex-announces-cardanos-ada-listing-following-successful-shelley-upgrade,utoday,2020-08-06,10:56:00,en

In a short video published on the Weiss Crypto Ratings Twitter page, the agency’s ratings analyst Juan M. Villaverde answered a question from a @teopassos user about whether the Shelley hardfork conducted by Cardano a week ago is a good enough reason to update the platform’s score. In response, the agency stated that the recent Shelley code upgrade has not impacted the high rating of Cardano given to it last year. This major code upgrade, according to the analyst, had been already included in the score, since the agency had total confidence that Charles Hoskinson’s platform would implement it. The ability of Cardano to launch smart contracts and dapps was also taken into account when giving the platform its rating last year, the analyst added. Nothing that is on Cardano’s roadmap already can impact its current rating, Villaverde says. However, now that Shelley has been rolled out, it can indeed be reflected in the score if the Cardano blockchain gets increased usage thanks to this major upgrade. Besides, as per the analyst, if Cardano fundamentals improve over time, this improvement will be reflected in the Weiss Crypto Ratings technical score of the platform. Last year, the agency gave the Cardano blockchain a high rating, saying that this platform had been largely underestimated by the community. Weiss Ratings also slammed EOS for being heavily centralized. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has tweeted that ADA withdrawals resumed this morning after they installed an official upgraded version of the wallet received from Cardano.

cardano, News , Adam Back: Some ICOs Funded Useful Research Despite Being Unethical ,"Adam Back recently took to Twitter with  controversial comments  on many of the industry’s largest crypto projects — including Ethereum (ETH), Cardano (ADA), Ripple (XRP), and Stellar (XML). His tweets placed these projects in the same category as a number of bonafide scams, which he considers to have been orchestrated as “premines”. We interviewed Back in order to clarify his position on the matter, starting with questions of how he feels about Satoshi Nakamoto essentially premining  over one million Bitcoin . Back responded that “Bitcoin has no premine”, adding that he considers Patoshi research to be “highly speculative”. However, he agreed that Satoshi was able to amass a large amount of Bitcoin in the early days when the mining difficulty was low: “Yes I am agreeing with you. Even in the first year of bitcoin there would have been about 2.6 million coins mined at 50btc/block. So likely > 80% are other miners, clearly there were many 2009 miners.” Yet, he still believes there is a difference between mining coins at a very low cost and premining. In the case of most ICOs, he noted that “it was unknown that bitcoin would bootstrap and have value. It didn't even have an exchange listing for over a year.” Though the same could be said about many ICO coins, Back parried by focusing on what he perceives as the unscrupulous nature of ICOs. In his opinion, the  main goal of an ICO is to enrich its creators  — Something he believes most would consider unethical. Back also noted that ICOs offer investors far less in the way of legal protection. He elaborated: “There are no investor rights, no financial oversight so I don't think you can really assert what the money is spent on. Given the temptation and presumed motivation it is likely that most is lost to grift and personal enrichment of founders, promoters etc., when the money is used up they move onto the next coin.” High school architecture with $1B marketing We asked Back if he earnestly believes that no major ICO project will ever deliver anything of note. With some hesitation, he admitted that a few may have funded useful research. He still believes that it is highly inefficient to utilize funds in this manner overall. He said: “Obviously there are exemptions, and some interesting ICO or pre-mined altcoins funded research, or grants to skilled researchers, but the efficiency of capital I think is order of 100x less effective in converting money to secure, robust protocols than lean startups.” The  Hashcash creator  believes that most of the top projects by market capitalization are nothing but high school projects “with a $billion marketing budget”: “I think we can presume that incentives matter, and so it is a variant of follow the money — if they have immediate liquidity and no oversight they overspend on marketing, price manipulation over engineering substance.” Back also supposed that ICO projects are left with second-rate engineers as most top blockchain developers “would not work for ICOs as a matter of principle”.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/adam-back-some-icos-funded-useful-research-despite-being-unethical,cointelegraph,2020-08-08,00:00:00,en

This means that 39.5 percent of the token’s 26 bln circulating supply has already been put to work to participate in the network’s governance.    As  reported by U.Today , Cardano’s much-awaited Shelley hard fork went live on July 29 after five years of development, allowing all ADA holders to participate in staking.  As of now, there are 890 active stake pools, an 84 percent increase since the upgrade’s launch.  The goal is to reach 1,000 of them, which will ensure a sufficient level of decentralization.   Unlike some other proof-of-stake blockchains, Cardano prioritizes staking pools to make sure that there are enough node operators.   Cardano users can either start their own pool (implying that they are tech-savvy enough to pull this off) or join an existing one. The former option will result in bigger rewards.      In order to make sure that not a single pool can become too big to dominate the whole network, Cardano users are incentivized to see other alternatives due to declining fees.        During a  Twitter spat  with Block.one CTO Daniel Larimer, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson confirmed that Cardano would also introduce smart contracts and native assets on top of staking this year.

cardano, News , Ethereum Classic’s Leadership Says They Don’t Need Charles Hoskinson's Bailout ,"Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson recently offered to help the troubled Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) community, but it  came  with a major condition. The community would first have to institute a decentralized treasury system, similar to Hoskinson’s Cardano and many other blockchain projects. If the community did not accept his terms, Hoskinson felt like his help would have been a waste of time and money: “It's not worth my company's time or our strategies to pivot for a grant or a one off payment to go and bail us out. If there is a treasury system, it means that I can be in the business of building open source innovations and open source software and bringing these things to market and be paid to do that patent free and open source.” Ethereum Classic recently  suffered multiple 51% attacks , leaving the project’s fate uncertain. According to Hoskinson, his Cardano development company, IOHK, has done quite a bit of research in the proof-of-work space and may have a way to prevent similar attacks from occurring on the network in future. IOHK has developed a hybrid proof-of-work, proof-of-stake protocol that also employs a periodic checkpoint system to prevent hostile network reorganizations. Hoskinson still has a 15-man team working on this project, but he is not willing to make any future commitments unless Ethereum Classic leadership accepts his terms. Despite leaving the Ethereum project to work on Cardano, Hoskinson believes that it is still his moral obligation to help the project. Yet Hoskinson lamented that despite him helping the Ethereum Classic community in the past, he has been treated unfairly by its leadership. Terry Culver, CEO of ETC Labs and ETC Core, released this statement to Cointelegraph in response to Hoskinson’s offer: ""As an open-source, decentralized community, we welcome all ideas and appreciate that so many people in the blockchain community have reached out to us. That said, we're not waiting for someone else to step in. We are a focused team who are passionate for ETC, and we will work diligently to ensure a bright future for ETC.""

cardano,No Section,"ADA and LINK Less Correlated to Bitcoin Than Other Top Coins, including USDT: Skew Data","Analytics firm  Skew believes  that two major altcoins, Cardano’s ADA and Chainlink’s LINK, are much less correlated to Bitcoin than the other top crypto assets are, including Tether. In their recent tweet, analysts at Skew published a graph showing that two top-tier altcoins, ADA and LINK, are not so much related to Bitcoin as to the other altcoins on the Top 10 list. In fact, these two assets are the least correlated with BTC. Among the Top 10 coins, the biggest correlation to BTC can be seen for Bitcoin Cash (BCH), Bitcoin SV (BSV) and Litecoin (LTC): 0.7. Earlier this year, Santiment analytics agency  shared a report  in which it announced that there was an inverse correlation between Bitcoin and the most popular stablecoin, USDT. Therefore, the amount of USDT on crypto exchanges directly affects the level Bitcoin is trading at. If the correlation is direct, the price of assets tends to move in the same direction. However, the weaker the correlation is, the better chance an altcoin has to move independently of Bitcoin. LINK has recently surprised the market by showing a massive rise, surging from the $4.75 area to $9 and now over $13 per coin, according to data from  CoinMarketCap . After a 37-percent rise on Sunday, Aug. 9, LINK managed to briefly  take the Top 3 position , pushing back Tether and XRP, based on data from OnChainFx provided by Messari. However, at press time, CoinMarketCap shows that Chainlink holds spot number 6. This was preceded by several major partnerships that Chainlink was engaged in and threats from the fake Zeus Capital bank. Despite its recent pull back, the coin now remains more than 956 percent up from its drop on Black Thursday (March 12). On July 31, the Cardano platform officially performed its long-expected code upgrade, Shelley. According to founder Charles Hoskinson, this hard fork will make the platform completely decentralized and ensure the appearance of smart contracts, dapps and native assets on Cardano. Hoskinson also proudly stated that, as soon as all that appears, ADA will become the best cryptocurrency out there.

cardano, News ," Adam Back: Bitcoin is Enough, Satoshi Should Stay Out ","In a Cointelegraph interview,  Adam Back provided additional clarity  on his perceived Bitcoin ( BTC ) maximalism. Blockstream’s CEO believes that Bitcoin is enough and there is no need for a multitude of derivative projects. Back said, “I think it's like TCP/IP the internet exists. We don't need 5800 TCP/IP copies trying to monetize and profiteer off pumpanomics or such. It detracts from value (I gather there are about 5,800 altcoins as of today)”. He noted that innovators should focus on Bitcoin instead: “It's modular, you can build anything you want using it, if you're trying to innovate, go ahead and innovate”, adding “bitcoin is electronic cash for the internet.” Discussing Satoshi rumors , Back noted that it would be unwise for Satoshi to reveal himself “I'm not sure if that would be a wise idea for him, nor for bitcoin”. Yet Back agreed that even if Satoshi were to come back, he would likely not be able to take back control of Bitcoin’s development: “Yes, I think Bitcoin is decentralised enough to reject Satoshi views even if he went nuts.” It became evident that Back’s distaste for ICO projects has not died out when we noted that one of the projects he slammed — Cardano ( ADA ), prides itself on a scientific approach to development. Back stated that “I would sooner not comment on projects because they fish for marketing quotes.” He continued by alleging that some altcoin critics have received death threats in the past. He also lamented the fate of the volunteers who dare to criticize major altcoin projects on ethical grounds: “Look at the flack a few unfunded volunteers take for even commenting about the ethical considerations, the multi-billion dollar incentive mis-alignment. the people you are commenting on are hugely funded, awash with retail investor cash and looking to perpetuate the game into the next coin.” Finally, we asked Back if there are any crypto or blockchain projects, other than Bitcoin, that he likes. He noted a fondness for some technologies, but again refused to name any names: “There are some technologies I like, in formal security, cryptography like bullet-proofs, simplicity (formal provable smart-contracting), some privacy tech. I don't like to name coins though some have deployed tech I invented over the years.” Back’s maximalism is unlikely to win him many friends in the crypto space. However, with Blockstream dominating Bitcoin discourse, perhaps he does not need friends, only followers.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/adam-back-bitcoin-is-enough-satoshi-should-stay-out,cointelegraph,2020-08-11,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , People Are Already Building Businesses Around Cardano’s Staking Functionality ,"In a recent Cointelegraph interview, Aparna Jue, a product director at  IOHK , the Cardano ( ADA ) development company, opined that even at the current stage of its development, the platform is much more than just a wallet. Cardano recently migrated  from the Byron to the Shelly era, ushering in decentralization through the introduction of staking pools. However, the platform does not yet have smart contracts or a decentralized governance module. While Charles Hoskinson promised that  smart contracts will be implemented  before the end of 2020, Jue told Cointelegraph that even now, she considers Cardano a success. She noted that Cardano is already contributing to the gig economy as pool operators are creating businesses around staking pools: “This could be a way of the future where you could be at home and you can run a proof-of-stake protocol and you can earn some rewards for it. And a lot of our pool operators are doing just that and trying to figure out how to help them make a business out of it. So to me, that's already started the success for Cardano and a proof-of-stake system.” However, Jue said that in addition to working on the codebase for the Goguen upgrade, there are other more mundane tasks at hand. One of these tasks is facilitating a developer community that wants to build decentralized applications using Plutus — a Haskell-based language used by Cardano’s smart contracts: “If we don't understand the types of tool flows and how they like to build then just putting that functionality on-chain, It's going to be attacking a very small subset of expert developers. And we want this to be a platform that a lot of people can use.” No official release date for Goguen has been announced, though  according to Hoskinson , it will launch in 2020.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/people-are-already-building-businesses-around-cardanos-staking-functionality,cointelegraph,2020-08-12,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Ethereum Classic Community Divided Over Charles Hoskinson’s Proposed Treasury Protocol ,"Charles Hoskinson  presented  his idea for a  decentralized treasury protocol to the Ethereum Classic  ( ETC ) community during a Discord call on August 13. Hoskinson, who is the founder of Cardano ( ADA ) and one of the co-founders of Ethereum, strongly believes that setting up an independent source of funding for development and innovation can ensure the prosperity of ETC. Hoskinson’s proposal to change ETC’s block reward allocation would mean that instead of rewards going entirely to the network’s miners, blocks would allocate a portion of every reward to a newly-created decentralized treasury. This treasury would then be used to finance future development of the ecosystem. IOHK, a company which Hoskinson runs, has also apparently developed a technology that would prevent future 51% attacks.  He contended that the best defense against such attacks is innovation, which he believes will attract more DApps and users. This would lead to the appreciation of ETC, which would in turn attract more miners, making such attacks improbable in the future. Not everyone was enthused by Hoskinson’s proposal, however. Some felt that a reduction in rewards would lead to a miner exodus, while others did not like the idea that initial projects might all be led by IOHK. When explaining the supposedly unfair advantage that ICO projects have over ETC, Hoskinson took a small swipe at Ethereum and Chainlink: “ETC would be at a very different place, Ethereum had an unfair advantage. All those people who wanted to do cool stuff like the chainlinks and so forth, they did their ICOs. That's how they funded everything. Our ecosystem was much more principled. We didn't succumb to the ICO mania.” It sounded for a moment as if  Hoskinson was channeling Adam Back , who recently lambasted ICO projects, including Cardano. But things became truly heated when James Wo’s question was read by the moderator. James Wo’s question.  Wo is the founder and CEO of Digital Finance Group — a crypto investment firm with $550 million in assets under management. His group has a vested interest in one of the biggest contributors to the ETC ecosystem, ETC Labs. From the tone of his question, Wo appeared to perceive Hoskinson’s proposal as a hostile takeover attempt. Hoskinson jumped in before letting the moderator finish reading, directing his answer directly to Wo: “Because I was here in the very beginning, James, and I put millions of dollars of my own money in. I understand that you put money in and that's why I say we should split it up. But I was here in the beginning. I put my brand and reputation on the line.” When the moderator finished reading Wo’s question, Hoskinson continued: “I was here in the beginning, in the beginning of Ethereum, in the beginning of Ethereum Classic; again, I put my own time and money in. I didn't ask for anything until I had a fully working client built with 100% new code.” Terry Culver, the CEO of ETC Labs, jumped in to interrupt Hoskinson, but was silenced by the moderator. The call lasted a total of 90 minutes, though some stayed on after the main participants left.

cardano,No Section,"$44 Bln Worth of Miners to be Fired by ETH Soon, I’d Love a Lot of Them to Join Ethereum Classic: Cardano Founder","The founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson — who also co-founded Ethereum and helped create Ethereum Classic — has shared details  of his vision of how to strengthen the Ethereum Classic network and attract more miners to it from those Ethereum will fire after switching to proof of stake. On Aug. 13, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  posted a video  on Twitter in which he shared his regrets about ETC Labs CEO Terry Culver, who refused outright to accept his proposal to build a treasury system within Ethereum Classic. This proposal, Culver stated in a blog post,  goes against ETC's core values . He also wrote that funding is not at issue; the issue is ETC network's vulnerability to 51-percent attacks. Two such attacks occurred recently within an interval of about a week and, during the second one, the culprit walked away with $5.6 mln worth of ETC. 
 
 Hoskinson said that his online discussion with around fifty top ETC community members went rather well. He laid out his proposal with the details. Some members disagreed and argued with him. He said that there were two ways to prevent the repetition of 51-percent attacks in the future. The first one is to set up a checkpoint system that would merely mitigate those attacks in the future. The second one is setting up a treasury, i.e., taxing miners so that part of their earnings would go to a contract and be accessible to several top members of the ETC community — those who maintain the core structure of ETC. Hoskinson mentioned that Ethereum plans to fire $44 bln worth of miners soon (as it rolls out Ethereum 2.0 and switches to proof of stake from proof of work) and he would love to see that army begin verifying transactions on the ETC chain. Another crucial issue, per Hoskinson, is a clear vision for ETC for 2021. Overall, he stated that he does not mind which option the community chooses, the checkpoint system or the treasury system. The former would prevent further 51-percent attacks anyway. However, as per Hoskinson, the treasury system and a vision for 2021 will allow Ethereum Classic to improve, make it attractive to devs and investors and ultimately allow it to develop complexity and compete with Ethereum 2.0.",https://u.today/44-bln-worth-of-miners-to-be-fired-by-eth-soon-id-love-a-lot-of-them-to-join-ethereum-classic,utoday,2020-08-14,15:17:00,en
cardano,No Section,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson Promises ""Massive"" Performance Improvements in Cardano Node ","In his latest  YouTube livestream , IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson shares some details about the upcoming release of Daedalus 2.2, a wallet for Cardano users, that is slated to happen on Aug. 20. 
 
Hoskinson says that it will come out with version 1.19 of the Cardano Node will offer “very significant performance improvements”: “Some aspects of the software are 100 times faster, and QA is reporting that everything looks pretty good so far.” 
 
   IOHK, the company that supports the development of Cardano, launched Daedalus 1.0 back in April. 
 
It’s a full-node hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, which means that it downloads the history of Cardano’s full blockchain. This is a tradeoff for ensuring a higher level of security given that ADA holders do not have to rely on third-party apps.      The Ethereum co-founder praised the development team that managed to achieve such substantial enhancements in the node software, the core of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain, within a short span of time, noting that they are “digesting Shelley very well.”    According to Hoskinson, the new node release will have even more improvements in functionality.  “I’m still beating the drum of new feature developments so in addition to all this remediation, cleanup and digestion, which is what we anticipated for August, we're really getting excited about September.” As  reported by U.Today , Cardano rolled out the much-anticipated Shelley hard fork in July, thus finally enabling staking.   Last week, the very first community pools started minting blocks, which marks the start of the blockchain’s journey to reaching full decentralization.          With the Goguen and Basho eras kicking off soon, Hoskinson expects things to become “crazy” for the project by the end of 2020:   “So, if this is the trend, we’re going to get so strong by the Q4-Q1 timeframe where it’s really going to be crazy to see how quickly things move in that direction, so I’m pretty happy about that.” ",https://u.today/iohk-ceo-charles-hoskinson-promises-massive-performance-improvements-in-cardano-node,utoday,2020-08-19,19:17:00,en
cardano,Markets,Blockchain Project Qtum Moves to Boost Network Participation With Offline Staking,"Blockchain application platform Qtum will soon undergo a hard fork enabling network participants to stake and earn rewards from tokens held in offline wallets. Announced Tuesday, the fork – when the blockchain divides to provide an alternative version with different features – will usher in a new code release at block 680,000, expected Aug. 28. The upgrade will enable offline wallet address owners to delegate their blockchain-based holdings – technically termed unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) – to an online node operating Qtum's proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. PoS is a distributed consensus mechanism that allows users to vote on governance decisions and support the blockchain by dedicating, or ""staking,"" tokens, earning them network fees as a reward. Qtum  previously only allowed participants to stake tokens online via a full node, but participation was limited by users who did not want to, or could not, run a full node. Offline staking is expected to increase participation, while also enhancing Qtum's ""democratic, distributed, and secure"" functionality, according to a statement. The fork is being supported by cryptocurrency exchanges including Binance, Huobi, OKEx, Coinone, CoinDCX and Gate.io. Qtum  launched in 2017 as a hybrid blockchain  featuring aspects of Bitcoin and Ethereum to provide smart contract functionality for distributed app developers seeking an alternative platform.

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson's IOHK submitted a decentralized treasury proposal to the Ethereum Classic community ,"Charles Hoskinson's IOHK recently published two Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals, or ECIPs, meant to help the struggling chain recover after a slew of recent 51% attacks. The first introduced a checkpoint system to prevent the possibility of such attacks, and the second proposed a decentralized treasury — a seemingly divisive idea within the ETC community. 
 Following  the recent attacks , a heated debate ensued concerning the project's future. Hoskinson, one of Ethereum's co-founders and a supporter of the ETC fork, believes that the way forward revolves around the institution of the decentralized treasury. The proposal suggests that the current method of funding has failed and it is time for a change: 
 ""The current approach of relying on voluntarism and benefactors to support the ETC eco system has failed.""   
 
 Hoskinson's Cardano ( ADA ) and several other major cryptocurrency projects have already successfully implemented a decentralized treasury, allowing for independently funded research and development. The difficulty is that most projects institute this sort of mechanism from the beginning. In the case of ETC, there are fears that the sudden shock of such a major change could lead to a decline in hash rate, putting the network at greater risk. 
 Terry Culver, the CEO of ETC Labs and one of the main stakeholders in the ecosystem, said in an email to Cointelegraph that he disagreed that the current system has failed: 
 A treasury will be the true sign of failure of ETC. You can’t build a decentralized public blockchain with a “money tree” that benefits a few. ETC Labs, the COOP and other members of the community will do everything necessary to secure the network. 
 Such a proposal would ultimately reduce the rewards miners receive for contributing to the network. These individuals would have to be convinced that the positive impact on the price of ETC will make up for the proposed 20% reduction in block rewards.  
 The current reward, which is is 3.2 ETC per block, would be reduced to 2.56 ETC if IOHK's proposal passes. This would leave a difference of 0.64 ETC, which would instead go straight to the treasury. Miners would also have the option to burn 20% of the block reward instead of donating it to the fund. 
 The initial distribution from the treasury suggests that 10% would go towards Gitcoin grants, with the remaining funds being divided amongst three development projects chosen by the community. These would each receive 30% of the allocation. 
 Culver said that ETC Labs is willing to work with IOHK for the betterment of Ethereum Classic, but will reject the treasury proposal: 
 ""We do not support the treasury proposal, because a tax on miners will cripple the network. We would be asking miners to make 20% less on ETC when mining other chains is already more profitable. It will drive them away at the moment we need them, reduce the hashrate, and make the network more vulnerable. Long term, a treasury would essentially turn ETC into a private blockchain, with centralized governance and a monopoly on decision making."" 
 Charles Hoskinson told Cointelegraph that with the checkpointing system in place, the drop in hashrate will not matter anymore: 
 Sure we could get a short term drop, but we no longer rely upon them to ensure the system is secure. 
 He added that eventually the miners would come back as his proposal would foster ETC adoption and growth: 
 There would be a hybrid model in this case. Giving us time to rebuild interest and adoption, which increases the price much more than 20 percent bringing miners back. They aren't voters, they are businesses 
 A virtual meeting of ETC core developers is  scheduled  for today to discuss various hard fork proposals, including IOHK's checkpointing system.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-s-iohk-submitted-a-decentralized-treasury-proposal-to-the-ethereum-classic-community,cointelegraph,2020-08-28,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , A new Cardano-based project is handling oracles a lot differently than Chainlink ,"Cardano ( ADA ) is getting into data oracles ahead of the Goguen era that will add smart contract functionality, taking a different approach than Chainlink. The first oracles are being built in partnership with EMURGO, one of the companies in the Cardano ecosystem, and Ergo (ERG). The first two oracles are deployed on Ergo and  provide  price feeds for the two trading pairs: ADA/USD and ERG/USD. The new model  introduces  Oracle Pools, which are capable of incentivizing good and disincentivizing bad behavior. Ergo's core developer Alexander Chepurnoy told Cointelegraph that the idea involves major players in the DeFi ecosystem donating funds to the oracle pools that they find useful. Then, the data providers get compensated with the funds from the pool.  The model also envisions data providers staking funds as collateral. If a data provider feeds low-quality data, his stake can get ""slashed"". Unlike Chainlink, which introduced a LINK token as gas-like payment mechanism, the new model is cryptocurrency agnostic. Rumors  started  peculating when Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tweeted about talking to Chainalink's co-founder Sergey Nazarov. Some were expecting an announcement to be made soon about Cardano integrating Chainlink's oracles. However, thus far, these rumors have not materialized. Likely, Cardano is in no hurry as there is little use in oracles before the Goguen era. At the same, it allows it time to test oracle infrastructure developed in-house.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/a-new-cardano-based-project-is-handling-oracles-a-lot-differently-than-chainlink,cointelegraph,2020-08-28,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson Says He's Been ""Obsessed"" with DeFi","IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson spilled some beans about Cardano’s foray into the decentralized finance during his  most recent YouTube AMA :   “For example, we’ve partnered with Emrugo, and we're right now working on the logistics of a stable coin with them that we're going to be building first on ergo to verify everything works correctly, and then we'll pull it over into Cardano and this is going to be an algorithmic stablecoin. We think it'll be significantly better than MakerDAO. That’s just one of many DeFi things that are going on right now” Hoskinson claims that he’s “directly involved” in a lot of discussions about decentralized finance to make sure that they properly resourced and they have the right teams behind them. Speaking of how the DeFi bonanza is reviving Ethereum, Hoskinson notes that first-mover advantage in that space is actually a disadvantage. “Those network effects were ephemeral and often covered with mistakes and scars and explosions. You actually want to be in the imitator the second-mover category for DeFi, and I think we'll have a lot more luck than the first movers did in the space.” While more than 5.1 mln ETH ($7.83 bln at today’s prices) now locked in numerous DeFi applications, some industry luminaries maintain a skeptical attitude.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao recently opined that only a few of the DeFi projects will end up succeeding while most of them could see the fate of the embattled Yam Finance protocol. 
 One of the most notable trends in the DeFi space is the emergence of Ethereum as the main “Layer 2” solution for Bitcoin. 
 
 Wrapped Bitcoin (wBTC) , the biggest version of the ERC20 version of Bitcoin, is currently nearing $400 mln in locked value. While there are reservations about centralized custody, Hoskinson believes that synthetic tokens aren’t just buzzwords: “These are things that I would love to see in the next 12-24 months.” Hoskinson also took a swipe at Bitcoin maximalists like Adam Back and Tone Vays, claiming that their dismissal of other coins is harming the movement.   ",https://u.today/iohk-ceo-chalres-hoskinson-says-hes-been-obsessed-with-defi,utoday,2020-08-31,06:33:00,en

cardano, News , IOHK’s proposal for the ETC community could use Cardano or Bitcoin for prevention of 51% attacks  ,"Earlier today, IOHK  presented  its checkpointing proposal to the Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) community. This is meant as a short-term solution for preventing future 51% attacks. In the past several weeks, the network has suffered a number of such attacks, which has cast doubt on ETC’s future.  One of these attacks cost OKEx $5.6 million . In the wake of these problems, several exchanges increased validation times for ETC transactions.      Checkpointing consensus. Source:  IOHK presentation . As its name would imply, the solution proposes the introduction of checkpoints that would validate the network. Thus if an adversary were to mine a “shadow” network (as previous attackers did when they managed to double-spend funds on OKEx), this shadow network would not have those validating checkpoints. Therefore, while they may have more proof-of-work than the main network, it will not be accepted.  Checkpointing would be performed by an unspecified Ouroboros Byzantine Fault Tolerant, or OBFT, checkpointing network and signed on the ETC by ‘trusted members’. The checkpoints would be inserted on average every three blocks.  The proposal does not specify who would be chosen as trusted members, but if accepted, a heated debate is likely to ensue over the selection. OBFT consensus is also used by Cardano ( ADA ). We asked the presenters if  Cardano could be used instead of creating a new checkpointing network. They said that this is possible and that Bitcoin ( BTC ) could also be used for this purpose. As to the general question of the size of the checkpointing network, they said: It still needs to be defined, but it's important to know how that plays because the bigger the federation, the bigger time slots you need until you get agreement on the two-thirds of that [needed to reach consensus]. Members of the ETC community have made a number of proposals aimed at solving the existential issues faced by the network — from changing the hashing algorithm  to greater regulation of hashpower marketplaces . There is no way of predicting which route the ETC will take, yet, one thing seems to be certain — if something is not done soon, the network whose mantra is “code is law” may ultimately be repealed.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/iohk-s-proposal-for-the-etc-community-could-use-cardano-or-bitcoin-for-prevention-of-51-attacks,cointelegraph,2020-09-04,00:00:00,en

They are paired with the Tether (USDT) stablecoin.   
 
The exchange says that the new listings are a response to strong demand from its users.  
 
Given that Tether is responsible for the lion’s share of the total altcoin volume, the recently added trading pairs are supposed to reflect spot trading in a better way.          Notably, Chainlink (LINK) became the first DeFi-related cryptocurrency listed on the BitMEX exchange. 
 
Its arch-rival OKEx launched USDT-margined LINK futures back in November 2019, becoming the first notable exchange to list such a derivatives product. 
 
Binance Futures rolled out a perpetual contract for the high-flying cryptocurrency back in January. 
 
BitMEX has a rather conservative listing policy given that LINK is the first new token listed on the exchange since Tron (TRX) in 2018. 
 
While XTZ, EOS, and ADA were already tradeable on the exchange, users will now be able to speculate on the value of these coins with the help of USDT-underlying contracts. As  reported by U.Today , BitMEX also introduced quanto futures contracts for Ethereum (ETH), XRP (XRP), and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) earlier this year that allow going long or short on their USD rate while posting margin in XBT.

Since the launch, we've updated the list using data from Q1 and Q2 of 2020.  CoinDesk 20, ranked by two-quarter volume  Our goal with the CoinDesk 20 is to develop an objective method for filtering assets, not by their investment or speculative potential but by their currency with traders and investors. Our set of eight trusted exchanges, which provide the exchange volume data used to create the list, is conservative by design.  Orchid's price pumped in the past month,  benefiting from attention from David Portnoy , a publisher and media personality. It's worth reiterating the dollar volume that put Orchid in the CoinDesk 20 preceded this pump. It's possible it came in anticipation of Orchid's  mobile  and  desktop  apps, released in July.  Orchid price & volume For investors learning about Orchid for the first time, inclusion in the CoinDesk 20 may signal it is an asset with some level of staying power in the market. Intelligent investors need that assurance before devoting time and resources to researching or trading a new asset.  In the weeks since the start of Q3, we gathered the requisite data on Orchid to populate its asset price page.

cardano, Analysis , Challenging Ethereum 2.0? Competing blockchains are seizing the moment ,"After several years in development, Ethereum 2.0 is now more tantalizingly close than ever before. Despite a  shaky start with the Medalla testnet , it seems that development is still on track. Prysmatic Labs developer Raul Jordan  indicated in a recent blog post  that “2 to 3 months from the Medalla genesis block is still an ideal timeline.” At this point, what are another three months? The idea of an upgrade has been floating around in some form since the platform was first launched in 2015. The time it has taken to get this far in implementing Ethereum 2.0 speaks to the fact that it’s far more challenging to change the engine in a moving vehicle than it is to build one from scratch. Since 2015, many developers have indeed taken the opportunity to build their own engines, most often designed to overcome the same issues that ETH 2.0 is seeking to solve — and more, in some cases. While Ethereum 1.0 blazed a trail, the second version will launch in a now-thriving blockchain scene. And it’s undoubtedly the case that competition is getting stiffer. When EOS launched in 2018, it  didn’t necessarily shape up to be the Ethereum-killer  everyone predicted it to be before it launched. But recently,  Polkadot has been making progress,  with its DOT token now second only to Ethereum in terms of market capitalization for a development-platform coin. As things stand, there is plenty more competition, so how will Ethereum 2.0 shape up against other platforms in solving some of blockchain’s most pressing problems? Cardano vs. Ethereum 2.0 Cardano has been one of the most hotly anticipated rivals to Ethereum for some time. The platform was developed by one of the original co-founders of Ethereum, mathematician Charles Hoskinson, who left Ethereum in 2014 and subsequently founded IOHK, the company building Cardano.  Cardano has been the subject of many headlines this year as it has  launched its latest phase of implementation , known as Shelley, on its mainnet. This has introduced staking to the Cardano network, resulting in significant price action for its  ADA  token. However, like Ethereum 2.0, Cardano is working on a long-term implementation. Shelley is only the second phase, with three more to come, the next one ushering in smart contracts, with scaling and governance to follow.  In contrast to Ethereum 2.0, Cardano will ultimately operate an on-chain governance model. A representative from Quantstamp, which has been auditing Cardano’s codebase during recent months, previously told Cointelegraph that he believes the project will ultimately  dwarf the other major on-chain governance platform, Tezos , becoming second only to Ethereum as the smart-contract platform of choice. Tezos vs. Ethereum 2.0 Tezos, which launched in 2018, shares a home with Ethereum, given that the foundations behind both projects chose to base themselves in Switzerland’s Crypto Valley. Tezos was developed by Arthur and Kathleen Breitman, although relations between the Breitmans and the Tezos Foundation have been  notoriously fraught with infighting .  Tezos operates on a delegated proof-of-stake consensus, which it calls “liquid proof-of-stake.” However, researchers have found that Tezos, while not achieving the same level of decentralization as Ethereum, is more decentralized than many DPoS blockchains. Most likely, this is because Tezos doesn’t impose any upper limit on the number of nodes. Tezos and Ethereum 2.0 can, therefore, certainly compete on security and throughput. The main difference between the two is, perhaps, Tezos’ on-chain governance model.  When the Breitmans conceived of the platform, their vision was for it to be self-maintaining. Similar to what is ultimately planned for Cardano, anyone who meets the minimum staking requirements can vote on protocol upgrades that are then directly implemented once voted through. In contrast, Ethereum governance has always been an off-chain effort and will remain so for the foreseeable future. So far, it would be fair to say that neither model has proven itself inherently superior to the other. RSK vs. Ethereum 2.0 RSK was launched in late 2017 and caused much excitement around the platform’s promise to bring smart-contract functionality to  Bitcoin . Furthermore, with the capacity for many hundreds of transactions per second, it was one of the first real threats to Ethereum in terms of scalability. RSK is also merge-mined with Bitcoin. Now encompassing up to 48% of the Bitcoin network’s total hashing power, it’s also one of the true rivals to Ethereum in terms of achieving network security through decentralization. With the backing of parent company IOV Labs, RSK has been making headway in a number of areas. In terms of competition to Ethereum, interoperability and an expansion into the  decentralized finance  space are the most notable.  Earlier this year, RSK launched an interoperability  bridge  with Ethereum, enabling anyone to  send tokens back and forth  between the two platforms, including RSK-based stablecoins and leveraged tokens launched by developer Money on Chain. Diego Gutierrez Zaldivar, CEO of IOV Labs, believes that it’s this interoperability that’s the biggest lever for blockchain adoption, rather than a rivalry approach. He told Cointelegraph: “We believe that Bitcoin, RSK, Ethereum, and other open blockchains will form a network of networks, the Internet of Value, that will become the financial and social infrastructure of the future. Interoperability is key to ensure blockchain technology antifragility and mass adoption.”  Qtum vs. Ethereum 2.0 Qtum achieved a significant milestone in its roadmap this year with a successful fork to a new version of the mainnet. Similar to what Ethereum 2.0 is currently testing, Qtum runs on a PoS consensus. However, while  Ethereum 2.0 staking  will require a minimum stake of 32 Ether ( ETH ), creating a significant barrier to entry, Qtum is striving to ensure that anyone can participate in its staking program. Most recently, Qtum launched  offline staking , making it one of the only platforms that allows users to stake funds that are stored in an offline cold storage wallet. With all staking programs, the biggest rewards come from staking a larger number of tokens; however, there are no minimum staking requirements on Qtum. Jordan Earls, co-founder of Qtum told Cointelegraph: “We see the shift to proof of stake as validating what we’ve long thought from the beginning on energy, user-friendliness, and security. In addition, we’ve unfortunately seen that the old adage that Proof of Work is inherently more secure than Proof of Stake turns out to be untrue with the increase in 51% attacks on [proof-of-work] chains such as Ethereum Classic. We think this validates our view that proof-of-stake is the future of consensus for the vast majority of non-Bitcoin chains.” Qtum also runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, meaning that the project could potentially benefit from developments in Ethereum 2.0, such as sharding. However, unlike Ethereum, which is restricted to the Solidity programming language for now, developers can write their decentralized applications in a variety of more widely used languages.  Matic Network vs. Ethereum 2.0 As a second layer for Ethereum, Matic Network offers many comparable benefits, such as  ERC-20  token compatibility. However, according to the project, it comes with scalability of up to 65,000 transactions per second. The project gained early backing from Binance with a token sale on the exchange’s Launchpad platform for initial exchange offerings and from Coinbase Ventures, which was an early  investor . Matic has also partnered with established projects, including  Decentraland , to enable high throughput.  So, if Ethereum 2.0 will bring better scalability to the platform, does this mean that second-layer projects such as Matic Network will no longer be required? Sandeep Nailwal, chief operations officer of Matic, doesn’t believe that Ethereum 2.0 will nail the scalability challenge in the same way that Matic has, telling Cointelegraph: “Ethereum 2.0 doesn’t provide infinite scalability. The best-case scenario is 64 shards, with sharded chains similar to today’s Ethereum chain. Assuming a single chain improves with PoS up to 50 transactions per second, total throughput will still only offer 3200 tps.” Nailwal believes that the simple fact of Ethereum supplying a higher throughput will drive even greater demand, creating a situation where Ethereum can never scale to the level required by its DApp activity, adding: “First layer blockchains are settlement platforms. They are not meant to support the ’business activity.’” With the craze for DeFi DApps pushing gas fees ever higher, those using second-layer platforms for features like governance votes can avoid the need to move to a competitor platform. Tron vs. Ethereum 2.0 An early rival to Ethereum,  Tron  launched in 2017. Under the leadership of Justin Sun, the platform made strides with its  acquisition of BitTorrent . In March 2019, Tether announced it was launching a TRC-20 version of  USDT . Within six months, Tron-based USDT had  grown to 12% of the total coins in circulation , due to Tron’s superior throughput compared with Ethereum.  However, Tron’s scalability comes at a cost, given that the platform is based on a delegated proof-of-stake consensus. In 2019, co-founder Lucien Chen  announced he was leaving the project  due to the “pseudo-decentralized” nature of Tron, which he believed was counterproductive to the company’s mission to “decentralize the web.” In contrast, Ethereum 2.0 will  launch  with over 16,000 validators on the Beacon Chain, according to ConsenSys.  Elrond vs. Ethereum 2.0 Elrond is one of Ethereum’s newer competitors, having  launched its mainnet  in July. In terms of scalability, Ethereum 2.0 will have a hard job keeping up, as the project achieved 260,000 transactions per second on its testnet, thanks to its adaptive state sharding mechanism.  According to Daniel Serb, head of business development at Elrond, the platform’s approach to sharding is comparable with Ethereum 2.0. Both platforms partition the network nodes, transactions and state of the blockchain to achieve high throughput. However, Elrond starts with a fixed number of shards that can process 15,000 transactions per second. However, the protocol allows for the number of shards to increase dynamically, depending on traffic. In contrast, the number of shards on Ethereum is fixed at 64. Developers may find that building on Elrond is more rewarding in the long term in comparison with Ethereum, as Serb told Cointelegraph:  “One of the most attractive features of Elrond is that smart contract authors get 30% of the gas utilized by their contract as royalties, without the caller having to pay more. Elrond smart contracts are upgradeable, which will definitely make life easier for any project’s lifecycle.” Algorand vs. Ethereum 2.0 Algorand, the brainchild of Turing Award winner and Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Silvio Micali, launched in 2019. The project claims to be the first to use a “pure proof-of-stake” consensus that ensures network security by making it impossible for the owners of a small fraction of its ALGO tokens to cause any harm. Perhaps the biggest area in which Algorand can rival Ethereum 2.0 is in development on the platform. Two of the biggest stablecoins issuers, Tether and USD Coin, operate on Algorand. In April, Props Project, a decentralized network of apps,  migrated from a private blockchain  to Algorand. Algorand’s head of product, Paul Riegle, recently told Cointelegraph that the project has been  sizing up the DeFi space  with its latest upgrades, with one of the most intriguing being “rekeying.” Currently, multisignature wallets can be a headache to manage if users want to change an authorized private key holder. Rekeying would allow users to move from a single key to a multisignature to a smart-contract-governed address with a built-in spending policy. Within the DeFi space, this kind of development could make things much easier for DApp operators that take custody of user funds. Cosmos vs. Ethereum 2.0 Cosmos  launched in 2019, causing a stir in the blockchain space as one of the first platforms offering blockchain interoperability. Cosmos was developed by Tendermint, a development company appointed by the nonprofit Interchain Foundation to build a cross-blockchain ecosystem. With interoperability proving to be a big focus area for blockchain in 2020, Cosmos could be seen as having an edge over Ethereum 2.0. But there’s a unifying theme that unites interoperable blockchain projects: Interoperability is a rising tide lifting all ships. Billy Rennekamp, grants manager at the Interchain Foundation, told Cointelegraph how interoperability benefits Ethereum 2.0 as much as any other platform:  “The ultimate vision is that there should be a large and diverse ecosystem of blockchains, including Ethereum 2.0 that remain composable via Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) and together form an Internet of Blockchains, or Interchain. If Eth2.0 utilizes IBC for their cross-shard communication, they will be able to use it for cross-chain communication as well.” Cosmos also offers scalability through Tendermint’s Byzantine fault tolerance consensus. According to Ethan Buchman, co-founder of Cosmos and CEO of Informal Systems, the classic BFT is arguably the most straightforward and flexible approach to reaching consensus. He told Cointelegraph: “Tendermint’s design decouples the BFT consensus engine from the Proof of Stake economics, allowing more experimentation in the economic details. In contrast, the ETH2.0 consensus is tightly integrated with the rest of the ETH2.0 stack.”  Ardor vs. Ethereum 2.0 Ardor launched in early 2018 and was one of the first platforms to pioneer a multichain architecture running on a  proof-of-stake  consensus. Ardor runs on a parent and child chain structure, which offers improved throughput compared with a linear blockchain like Bitcoin or Ethereum. This structure can be compared to Ethereum 2.0’s sharding mechanism, where Ethereum’s Beacon Chain will have sharded chains operating as substructures in parallel with one another. However, Ardor launched with another critical feature built in that is often overlooked by blockchain core developers: Ardor child-chain operators can issue their own native tokens, which are compatible with the parent chain. Lior Yaffe, co-founder and managing director of Jelurida — which operates Ardor and Nxt — told Cointelegraph that: “Ardor’s child chain bundling system enables an application developer to sponsor the transaction fees for its users, and optionally create a hybrid application of permissioned shard secured by a permissionless public chain,” adding that both features are available on the mainnet. Meanwhile, Yaffe remains skeptical about the Ethereum 2.0 implementation timeline: “How and when Ethereum 2.0 will be ready is anyone’s guess.” No “one blockchain to rule them all”?  So far, while all of these platforms have evident merits, none has yet managed to topple Ethereum in terms of adoption. However, given that the full Ethereum 2.0 implementation could still be at least a year or two away, things could still change. However, even if Ethereum manages to retain its crown, developments in interoperability and scalability mean there’s every reason to believe that these platforms could survive in the long term.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/challenging-ethereum-20-competing-blockchains-are-seizing-the-moment,cointelegraph,2020-09-09,00:00:00,en

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson’s treasury concept is about to get its first real-world test drive with ‘Project Catalyst’ ,"IOHK has distributed $250,000 worth of  ADA  to Project Catalyst. These funds will be allocated to several Cardano-based projects proposed by the community. Project Catalyst is one of the building blocks of Cardano’s Voltaire era, which is expected to bring decentralized governance to the ecosystem. According to IOHK’s press release, Project Catalyst is expected to control $70 million worth of Cardano’s ADA cryptocurrency in the future. Charles Hoskinson is a big proponent of decentralized treasuries, which he believes to be one of the greatest innovations of our time. The idea behind  decentralized treasuries is to make developers independent  of a project’s founders or executives, while at the same time providing reliable funding for their work.  With decentralized governance, the community can, in theory, propose development projects and then decide which ones get funded, and with how much runway. Several cryptocurrency projects such as Tezos ( XTZ ), Zcash ( ZEC ), and Decred (DCR) have already implemented this idea. Hoskinson likewise believes such a treasury could  provide a viable solution for Ethereum Classic , which has been recently beseeched with 51% attacks. During the test stage of Project Catalyst, a wide variety of projects were proposed. The list included everything from solar-powered houses underpinned by Cardano’s blockchain to projects that encourage women to enter the blockchain space. The latter is as close as it got to one of Hoskinson’s favorite topics, gender studies. Hoskinson’s livestream about this announcement can be found  here . According to the project’s development roadmap, the Voltaire era is supposed to begin by the end of 2020; Project Catalyst is a harbinger of this upcoming evolution.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/charles-hoskinson-s-treasury-concept-is-about-to-get-its-first-real-world-test-drive-with-project-catalyst,cointelegraph,2020-09-16,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson Blamed for Crypto Scams on YouTube, Urges Platform to ""Wake Up""","Founder of Cardano and IOHK, CEO Charles Hoskinson,  has tweeted  that it is time YouTube started doing something about numerous accounts hacked for fake giveaway scams. Since many of them have turned into Cardano scams, a lot of people blame Hoskinson. Charles Hoskinson has taken to Twitter to complain that he has been getting rebuked by the crypto community recently. That criticism is due to a bunch of Cardano giveaway scams that have been appearing on YouTube recently. The top-tier platform for video bloggers has done nothing about it as of yet. He tweeted that more and more channels have been hacked recently and turned into crypto scams where users are encouraged to send in some crypto and then receive a double (or larger) amount back from a well-known blockchain company, such as Cardano or Ripple. Hoskinson stated  that, since Cardano is frequently chosen by scammers, the community has been blaming him for the scams and urged YouTube to wake up and start doing something about this critical issue. And I noticed that more channels on YouTube have been hacked for giveaway scams. And of course the people hacked and their fans are blaming me because they see ""Cardano"". How many lawsuits have to happen before the YouTube Corporation wakes up? This is sad and unethical. An anonymous Reddit user has  published a post  warning the community that, recently, one more YouTube account was renamed ""Cardano Foundation"" and started a live stream. The user believes this is another scam on YouTube hiding behind the Cardano name. However, the same user stated that he cannot confirm that this is not ""the real Cardano."" The channel then was renamed ''Cardano Foundation'' and an hour later started broadcasting live. I'm not familiar with this crap at all, to me it looks like some pyramid scheme type of deal. From a quick scan of Twitter, it appears it's a type of a scam. Allegedly it is not the real Cardano Foundation altho I can't really confirm that. In April of this year,  U.Today reported  that the blockchain behemoth Ripple sued YouTube for its lack of response to the numerous fake XRP giveaways allegedly set up by Ripple to get people to send their crypto coins to scammers. The scammers promised to repay much more in return. Binance's CZ also shared his negative opinion of these scams on YouTube, where the bad guys published a video of CZ talking, claiming it was a livestream and setting up a fake crypto giveaway based on it. CZ slammed YouTube for not taking any action to put an end to these crypto scams.",https://u.today/iohk-ceo-charles-hoskinson-blamed-for-crypto-scams-on-youtube-urges-platform-to-wake-up,utoday,2020-09-16,10:22:00,en
cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, NEO, XMR, ADA, LINK ","The total crypto market capitalization has recovered from the Sep. 6 lows near $314 billion but it is struggling to sustain above the  $350 billion  mark, which shows that higher levels continue to attract sellers. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance fell from above 68% in mid-May to about 56% in the first half of this month as DeFi tokens embarked on a strong bull run.  However, in the past few days, the  DeFi assets have witnessed sharp corrections  and their volatility has increased. This could possibly shift traders’ attention back to Bitcoin. It’s also possible that Bitcoin’s inability to hold above the $11,000 level could also be negatively weighing on the confidence of altcoin and DeFi-token traders. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Although Bitcoin has been struggling to find momentum, a positive is that the  volume of Bitcoin futures trading on Bakkt has been increasing  and the exchange whale ratio is near yearly lows. This suggests accumulation by the whales and institutional traders. Currently, most major cryptocurrencies are not following a general trend as the price action has been mostly coin specific. This has opened up opportunities both on the short side and the long side. Hence, in today’s list, two short ideas have been discussed for the traders who are bearish on the crypto markets. BTC/USD The relief rally in Bitcoin is facing stiff resistance near the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $11,147.60. This shows that the bears have used the current relief rally to initiate short positions. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line and the $10,625 support, it will signal weakness. If the BTC/USD pair sustains below $10,625, it will increase the possibility of a retest of $9,835. However, if the pair rebounds off the $10,625 support sharply, this will be the first sign that the correction might be over. Trading momentum is likely to pick up after the rally breaks above the downtrend line. If the price closes (UTC time) above the downtrend line, the possibility of a rally to $12,460 increases. Even though there is resistance at $12,000 it seems likely that it will be crossed. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The pair is currently attempting to rebound off the uptrend line, which suggests that the bulls purchased the dip to this support. The buyers will now make one more attempt to push the price above the $11,147.60 resistance. If the bounce fizzles out and the bears sink the pair below the uptrend line, a drop to $10,625 could occur. This is an important support for the bulls because selling is likely to intensify if this level breaks down. If the pair rebounds off $10,625, a few days of range-bound action is possible. The flattening moving average on the 4-hour chart suggests a balance between supply and demand.  NEO/USD NEO  is currently facing stiff resistance at $25.23, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. However, as it is in an uptrend, traders are likely to view the dips as a buying opportunity.  NEO/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The immediate support on the downside is at $23 and below that at the 10-day simple moving average ($22.26). If the NEO/USD pair rebounds off either support, it will indicate that the bulls are not waiting for a deeper fall to buy which is a positive sign. If the bulls can push the price above the $25.23–$25.78923 resistance zone, the uptrend is likely to resume. The next target on the upside is $29. A break below the 10-day SMA will be the first sign that the momentum is weakening and a drop below $20.9633 will signal a possible change in trend. NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls pushed the price above the $25.23 resistance twice but they could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that the bears are attempting to stall the rally at this resistance.  However, on the downside, the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below $23, which shows that the buyers are accumulating on every minor dip.  This could keep the pair stuck between $23 and $25.50 for a few more days. The moving averages have flattened out, which suggests a balance between supply and demand.  XMR/USD The recovery in Monero ( XMR ) from the Sep. 5 low of $74.1012 has been strong and the bulls have pushed the price back above the moving averages, which increases the possibility that the correction might be over.  XMR/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a stiff fight at the $97.4615 resistance. If the XMR/USD pair turns down sharply from the current levels and breaks below $84, a drop to $74.1012 is possible. Conversely, if the bulls can arrest the next dip at the 20-day exponential moving average ($89), it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $97.4615. Above this resistance, a move to $105.9131–$107.3742 is possible. A break above $107.3742 can result in a rally to $120.   XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the recovery from $74.1012 has been gradual. Although the bears broke the pair below the 30-EMA on several occasions, they could not capitalize on it and intensify the selling.  This shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips. Currently, the price has again dipped back below the 30-EMA. If the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will try and drive the price above the overhead resistance at $97.4615. The short-term momentum is likely to weaken if the bears can break and sustain the price below the immediate support at $87.5629.  ADA/USD The relief rally in Cardano ( ADA ) from the lows of $0.0855982 on Sep. 6 hit a stiff resistance at $0.0997444 on Sep. 13. The moving averages are sloping down, which suggests that the bears are in command. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView In a downtrend, the bears short on pullbacks to resistance levels as that improves the risk to reward ratio of the trade. Currently, if the bears can sink the ADA/USD pair below the $0.0855982 support, the decline might resume. Traders can consider taking positions on the short side with an appropriate stop-loss to benefit from the likely down move. The next support on the downside is at $0.074 but if this support fails to hold, the drop can extend to $0.05.  This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off $0.0855982 and the bulls drive the price above $0.10. Such a move will suggest that the downtrend might be over.  However, it is not necessary that a new uptrend starts as soon as a downtrend ends because many times, the price remains range-bound as it tries to form a bottom.  Therefore, traders can step aside and wait for a new bullish setup to form if the price breaks above $0.10. ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has been gradually declining towards the critical support at $0.0855982 and a close (UTC time) below this level is likely to start the next leg of the down move. However, if the pair rebounds off $0.0855982, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above $0.10. If they succeed, a quick relief rally is possible. Conversely, if the price again turns down from $0.10, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) is in a downtrend and it has been making a lower high and a lower low pattern for the past few days, which shows that the bears are using the relief rallies to sell.  LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The down sloping moving averages suggest that the trend favors the bears. If they can sink the LINK/USD pair below $9.65, a drop to $9 is likely. This is an important support to watch out for because a break below this level is likely to resume the downtrend. The next support on the downside is $7. Therefore, traders can consider benefiting from the possible down-move. This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair turns up from the current levels or rebounds off sharply from the $9 levels and breaks above the downtrend line.  LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView On Sep. 5 and 6, the bears were unable to sustain the price below $10.50, which shows that the bulls were attempting to defend this level.  However, during the current fall, the price has been sustaining below $10.50 for the past two days, which suggests that the buying has dried up. The moving averages are sloping down gradually and the price is below the averages, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears. A break above the 30-EMA will be the first sign that the bears are losing their grip. Until then, the path of least resistance is to the downside.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

cardano, News , The Cardano Foundation’s new CEO says he will prioritize the platform’s longevity  ,"Cardano recently  celebrated  the third anniversary of its Mainnet launch. In the run-up to this occasion, Cointelegraph had the opportunity to discuss the project's future plans with the Cardano Foundation’s incoming CEO, Frederik Gregaard. Gregaard, who has not yet officially assumed the post of CEO, assured us that he would take on this new role sometime before Nov. 1, though he did not yet know the exact date. Currently, he is finishing his tenure at PwC, where he heads digital financial services for the multinational network. Gregaard believes that there is a natural sense of prejudice against open-source public blockchains, which he refers to as a ""trust gap."" Whereas the entire crypto space is barely 10 years old, many established corporate players have been around for decades, if not centuries. They may have business plans that cover longer time horizons than the existence of projects like Cardano. In addition, it is no secret that the average life expectancy of a crypto project tends to be low. This has only been exacerbated by the many crypto-related scams and illicit connections (often amplified by the media), which has created an unbecoming reputation for much of the space in the eyes of corporate users. If a major company chooses to rely on a blockchain for one of its core use cases, it needs to be sure the chosen protocol will continue to receive proper maintenance for the foreseeable future. The lack of surety around this promise has led to what Gregaard refers to as a ""trust gap"" — and one of his core missions will be to make this gap a relic of the past: “When you have an open project like this one, to convey this certainty to the larger corporations that we are going to be around in the next 10 to 20, 30 years. So you can build on us also for the long term, that we are sound both in terms of finances, but also in terms of team and people.” Although Cardano has been criticized for chronic development delays (much like its older sibling, Ethereum), this year may be different. The  platform underwent a mainnet upgrade, known as Shelley , earlier this year that brought on staking and pools. Yet according to Charles Hoskison, two more important upgrades are expected this year: Goguen, which will add smart contracts, and Voltaire, which will introduce decentralized governance. With this in mind, we asked Gregaard about the industries he sees as most promising for the adoption of Cardano. He said that even with the current state of Cardano’s development, it can be used to tackle a number of cases that exist as part of what he calls “financial services plus”: “Financial services plus — that includes treasury and insurance and so on. I see a lot of use cases there which we can actually start tackling already now.” Gregaard also believes that  COVID-19 has led to an acceleration of digital adoption. “It gave us five to six years of digital adoption of worldwide consumers, including enterprises in half a year,” he said. Yet it also revealed certain inefficiencies within the healthcare system: “And I think one of the large problems we are having today is that most of the states, they say they trust each other. Most of the hospitals and institutes, they say that they kind of we are all on the same page, but when it actually comes to real life. When it comes to life and death and the security of your country, stakes go up, right?” In his view, Cardano could be leveraged for a number of  use cases in this space , like tracing the origins of medications or recording patient vaccination records. Though, he admits that this is a heavily regulated industry rather than low-hanging fruit. Still, gaining traction in these big, well-established industries is essential for Cardano if it really intends to stick around for the decades to come.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-cardano-foundation-s-new-ceo-says-he-will-prioritize-the-platform-s-longevity,cointelegraph,2020-09-29,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," Cardano's real competition is not who you'd expect, says new Cardano Foundation CEO ","Frederik Gregaard, t he incoming CEO of the Cardano Foundation , shared with Cointelegraph his perspective on fintech's competitive landscape and major technology trends. Discussing competition, Gregaard said that the protocol's biggest opponents do not come from within the blockchain space: “I think the biggest competitor, it's really the largest technology companies today around, the large tech platforms such as Google, Amazon, Tencent, Alibaba, those kind of players”. Gregaard believes that social-media-based big technology providers have morphed from supplying their customers with meaningful tools to essentially owning and manipulating their users. He went so far as to call them “an addictive, mental, manipulative technology environment — that is where social media is. It's not just a tool waiting to be used, it has its own goals.” In his view, distributed technology represents the opposite of that, with Blockchain enabling users to wrestle back control of their data and identity: “You don't really feel today what's actually happening on the Internet. But everything you do is being monetized. And what is being populated in front of you right now is slowly moving you towards a certain direction. And I think when society figures out that nothing in this world is free, they suddenly end up with the blockchain."" In Gregaard’s view, blockchain technology allows for the construction of a society where an individual does not need to trade their digital sovereignty for the services provided by technology companies. In addition to “liberating” individuals from tech giants, Gregaard feels that the mass adoption of blockchain technology may help bring the people of the world closer together. He opined that in order to incite this level of change, major blockchain protocols like Cardano, Algorand and Tezos should put aside their differences and work together. Gregaard believes that the real danger is not that one of these platforms will lose to a competitor; it is that the blockchain space as a whole may otherwise never reach mass adoption: “I think the market is super-big. And if we start fighting about it, one or two companies, which technology stack are they choosing to do that DApps on? I think we are missing the boat. We need to start looking much like the whole population and the whole economic system: how do we build that?” Gregaard admitted that the odds may be stacked against decentralized disruptors. Tech giants have trillions of dollars at their disposal, and he said “there's a big chance that we won't get there.” Still, Gregaard believes that the technology Cardano is building is powerful enough to stand a fighting chance.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-s-real-competition-is-not-who-you-d-expect-says-new-cardano-foundation-ceo,cointelegraph,2020-09-30,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Australian dev aims to bring Cardano payments to Shopify stores ,"An Australian developer has almost completed work on a Cardano () app that will allow all Shopify stores to transact in ADA tokens and other tokens that run on the Cardano network. The project is being developed voluntarily by Jeronimo Backes who wants to help bring utility to the blockchain. The independent developer told Cointelegraph that he chose Cardano not only because he is already invested in the network, both financially and emotionally, but because he sees it as the most enterprise-ready blockchain that can scale appropriately, adding: “Unlike others, this one is the one I think is being built to last. It’s not like Ethereum, EOS, Tron, and others who are still in a proof-of-concept phase in relation to large-scale business use-cases.” Its  is open-sourced to encourage developer contributions and enable full customization and will enable stores to receive payments in ADA without the need of an intermediary. Any store owners that wish to use the app will simply need to select it from the range of payment applications available to them, Backes stated. Once installed, users will be sending funds directly to the store’s private wallets. No one else will see the payments, he said.  like Bitcoin (), Ether (), Bitcoin Cash (), Litecoin (), and Dash (), however the transactions are still facilitated by intermediaries such as Coinbase Commerce, BitPay, GoCoin and CoinPayments. Last month, Backes hit a problem with Cardano’s BIP 44 protocol, resulting in having to develop a brand new wallet from scratch, pushing development back at least two months. “Essentially,” Backes explained, “The problem lies with addresses requiring a small amount of ‘dust’ in order to be seen as active by the network.” This problem could be classed as critical since, if not resolved, it will result in stores not seeing certain transactions entirely. The new wallet will eventually support plugins, adding extra functionality such as automatically calculating and separating taxes from the main pool of funds held in it.  In light of having to develop his own wallet, the Cardano and Shopify integration will hopefully be released by the end of the year. Backes has submitted a  proposal  to Cardano’s Project Catalyst, which could receive a portion of the $200,000 Treasury fund marked for the winning proposals.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/australian-dev-aims-to-bring-cardano-payments-to-shopify-stores,cointelegraph,2020-10-01,00:00:00,en
cardano,Markets,eToro to Offer Staking Rewards for Holders of TRON and Cardano,"Multi-asset exchange eToro is launching a new service that will offer rewards for ""staking"" tokens, beginning with  TRON  and ADA. The trading platform announced Thursday that the service, one of the first to offer staking for Cardano's native ADA token, will go live later this month. eToro will effectively execute the staking on behalf of its users. Compared to proof-of-work protocols, which rely on miners running powerful computer hardware to confirm transactions, proof-of-stake (PoS) networks rely on the users themselves to stake, or lock up, their tokens and provides rewards for confirming transactions. eToro's service is aimed to make staking more accessible for everyday users, the firm said in a statement. The exchange will email reports to users showing how much income they've made on a monthly basis.  A spokesperson told CoinDesk the service will be free of charge for eToro clients. The number of fully functioning PoS networks is growing. Cardano, which has a market cap of $3.25 billion, launched its ""Shelley"" staking protocol in late July. The month before, Coinbase Custody  announced plans  to offer secure Cardano staking sometime in Q4 2020.

cardano, News , Trading platform eToro launches staking-as-a-service feature ,"The eToro trading platform announced on Thursday the launch of a dedicated staking service for its clients, letting users earn staking rewards from Cardano ( ADA ) and Tron ( TRX ). Users who hold positions in either of these currencies will be eligible for staking rewards, awarded monthly. The company said that other assets will be introduced later on as well. The system is completely automated and does not require any action from the part of the users, who are able to trade the assets normally. An eToro spokesperson told Cointelegraph that the rewards are calculated based on daily snapshots taken at 00:00 GMT. The system calculates the corresponding reward to be distributed at the end of the month based on an average daily position size. It follows that users who change their positions in these currencies during the month will also see their staking rewards change. An initial “intro period” is required to become eligible for rewards. Users must hold the asset for a certain period of time before accruing any rewards. The length of the period is variable, and amounts to nine days in the case of Cardano.  The spokesperson noted that the yield is only compounded monthly, which over time would lower the staking yield significantly compared to independent staking. Nevertheless, eToro believes that its platform is highly competitive in the market, with the spokesperson saying: “Clients staking on eToro benefit from doing so on a regulated and globally trusted platform. We also believe staking rewards on our platforms are among the most generous in the market, from a minimum of 75% of the staking yield.” Cardano  launched staking on mainnet  late in July, after extended trials on an incentivized testnet. Staking-as-a-service platforms  have been growing recently , with eToro competing with many exchanges and independent staking providers like Binance, Bison Trails, Coinbase and others.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/trading-platform-etoro-launches-staking-as-a-service-feature,cointelegraph,2020-10-01,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , SingularityNET set to ditch Ethereum for Cardano citing speed and cost issues  ,"SingularityNET, the AI company behind the expressive robot Sophia, is “ seriously discussing ” a migration from Ethereum to Cardano, after announcing a collaboration with IOHK. IOHK is run by the founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, and drives the development of the blockchain platform.  SingularityNET is a full-stack AI platform that lets anyone create, share, and monetize AI services at scale. The potential move to Ethereum is driven by concerns around speed and costs that have been badly affected lately by demand from DeFi platforms, with  gas cost peaking as high as $17  per transaction. The team also has doubts about the feasibility of Ethereum 2, which has been in development for the past few years but is still some way off being a practical solution. “Current speed and cost issues with the Ethereum blockchain have increased the urgency of exploring alternatives for SingluarityNET’s blockchain underpinning,” said Dr. Ben Goertzel, CEO and Founder of the SingularityNET Foundation. He said the partnership will help drive Caradano's development and  scale SingularityNET-based services:  “The transition of SingularityNET onto modern blockchains such as Cardano is a clear route to achieving scale and speed, and the completion of the fiat-to-crypto gateway will remove the requirement for  end-users of SingularityNET-based services to deal with cryptocurrency infrastructure” If SingularityNET goes ahead with the plan, it would swap its native AGI token from ERC20 to Cardano and completely ditch the Solidity programming language in favor of Plutus to create smart contracts. Dr. Goertzel took a swipe at Solidity's shortcomings saying: “As a Turing-complete language without simple dedicated mechanisms for creating more limited Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs), Solidity presents significant challenges to the formal program verification and the analysis methods that are critical to safety and security on today’s  Internet.” Dr. Goertzel believes the future is multi-chain, so there’s a good chance the team may not move away from Ethereum completely. In an  interview  with IOHK’s Charles Hoskinson he said that being a decentralized project it was up to the community and market to decide: “If the Cardano portion works much much better.. then everything should migrate there,"" he said. ""If it turns out that the Ethereum portion is more useful for some purposes, the Cardano portion is useful for some purposes, then so be it, right?” SingularityNET has a big vision for the future, with one of the important aspects something called  Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) — a hypothetical machine intelligence that has the capacity to understand or learn any intellectual task that a human being can. The network aims to create an ecosystem where a variety of different AIs can collaborate and outsource tasks to other AIs. For Dr. Goertzel, diversification and decentralization of AI is very important since most AI projects are owned by large tech companies. He hopes that Cardano will accelerate this process: “Cardano’s thoroughly formalized functional programming foundations have  potential to provide a rich and flexible basis for implementing advanced aspects of the SingularityNET design — but just as critically, they have strong promise to provide a secure and reliable basis for the network’s operations basic and advanced alike.” SingularityNET claims to be the first platform to allow different AIs to communicate with each other and share data while connecting developers and users. The company is also behind the most sophisticated and expressive robot to date, Sophia, and have applied for citizenship for the robot with the Maltese government.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/singulatitynet-set-to-ditch-ethereum-for-cardano-citing-speed-and-cost-issues,cointelegraph,2020-10-01,00:00:00,en
cardano, News ," The Cardano Foundation will preserve its independence, says new CEO ","The Cardano ( ADA ) ecosystem has a complex governance structure, not dissimilar from the way the U.S. democracy operates, with its built-in checks and balances.  There are three main players: the Cardano Foundation, EMURGO and IOHK; according to the  Foundation’s incoming CEO Frederik Gregaard , the governance will only get more complicated as more organizations join. He also said that he intends to maintain the Foundation’s independence from Cardano’s founder and IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson, who created this structure in the first place: “The Foundation law in Switzerland says that we need to be independent. That's exactly why it's interesting and why Charles chose to set it up like that, because he really, truly feels that the people who are going to protect the Cardano protocol for the generations to come, need to be independent.” The Foundation’s mission is the advancement of “the Cardano protocol.” It also retains a development company for the protocol, which is currently IOHK — though its contract expires later this year. With the Voltaire era scheduled for release in a few months, the community will soon vote on whether to extend IOHK’s contract. In the unlikely event that IOHK fails to secure the backing of the community, another development company will be hired to take their place. Although back in 2018, there was a serious rift between the two , it appears that the relationship has been mended since. IOHK is an independent entity, and though its primary focus is on Cardano, it works with other projects as well. For instance, recently,  it proposed a couple of solutions to Ethereum Classic . EMURGO was originally established as a venture arm of the ecosystem, but it appears to since have morphed into a broader technology company. Gregaard accepts that Hoskinson is more than just the head of Cardano’s development company and that there may be times when they will butt heads over the direction of Cardano’s development: “Charles did initiate the project together with one of his colleagues. So, there's no doubt about how brilliant he is and how visionary he is. But he's running a product company that needs to deliver products.   I'm sure that there are going to be some fights in terms of priorities and some spots where we believe, together with the community maybe, that we should go a bit more right and Charles wants to be a little bit more left and we need to agree on that together.” He said that having worked with Hoskinson for the past 6 to 12 months (as a PwC consultant), he has a good feeling about this relationship, though he does not expect it to be easy. Gregaard is a big supporter of decentralized governance. In his view, this presents a viable alternative to the current state of the world,  where giant tech platforms like Facebook and Google manipulatively exploit their users .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-cardano-foundation-will-preserve-its-independence-says-new-ceo,cointelegraph,2020-10-02,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Distributes Staking Rewards, Advances Level of Decentralization: Details","According to a recent announcement tweeted by Input Output Hong Kong software developers, Epoch 221 of Cardano's Shelley era will bring two improvements in terms of staking rewards distribution and community governance. Input Output HK has confirmed that the latest portion of staker rewards is on its way to validators' wallets. Also, IOHK  advised  all ADA holders who use exchanges as custody to double-check their security and privacy. First off, a fresh batch of #ADA rewards will be landing in the wallets of delegators. (If you are still hodling your ADA on an exchange, you should really have a think about that). The last statement may imply those KuCoin users who fell victim to the recent devastating hack. Seven days ago, on Sept. 26, attackers  stole  more than $250,000,000 in multiple cryptocurrencies. This fact dropped the Bitcoin (BTC) price and raised another round of debates about decentralization. Then, IOHK announced another reduction of ""D,"" the decentralization metric. When Shelley launched in late July, this indicator was set to 1. Once this metric reaches 0, the Cardano (ADA) blockchain will be entirely decentralized. In Epoch 221, IOHK claims, Cardano's (ADA) level of decentralization will allow the staker community to be in charge of 38 percent of all minted blocks. Thus, Cardano (ADA) showcases impressive progress in the first two months of the Shelley era. Last week was particularly fruitful for the global Cardano (ADA) community, as its Project Catalyst has partnered with the U.N. program Sustainable Growth Goals. Before Oct. 10, any open-source developer can take part in a hackathon organized by Cardano's Project Catalyst. The use cases of solutions developed by applicants should be aligned with the focuses of the U.N. program. We're thrilled to announce that IOHK is collaborating with the United Nations for its 75th year anniversary! Project Catalyst will be used to vote on proposals which meet the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals

cardano, Price Analysis ," Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, ADA, XMR, ATOM, VET ","Investors are concerned about the stability of the cryptocurrency market after it was faced with a flurry of adverse news in the past few days. Fortunately, the markets have matured to the extent that negative news no longer provokes wild price swings like they once did in crypto’s early days. The current stability shows that institutional investors do not consider the recent  KuCoin hack ,  CFTC and DOJ charges  against BitMEX, or even  President Donald Trump being diagnosed with coronavirus  as serious enough events to crash the crypto markets. Therefore, there was no panic liquidation in Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures after the news broke and the  open interest  remained stable. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 In a bullish trend, traders use price weakness caused by knee-jerk reactions to add to their positions. If Bitcoin continues to sustain above the psychologically critical level at $10,000, more investors may consider adding to their portfolios. Despite Bitcoin’s sideways price action, a few altcoins have maintained their uptrend and others are showing signs of a possible bullish trend reversal. Let’s analyze the charts of the top 5 cryptocurrencies to see which critical levels may signal the start of a trending move. BTC/USD The long-term trend in Bitcoin is bullish as the 200-day simple moving average ($9,448) is sloping up. However, in the short-term, the flat 20-day exponential moving average ($10,682) and the relative strength index close to the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The BTC/USD pair is currently stuck between $9,835 and $11,178 for the past few days. A break above or below this range could start a trending move. Between May and July, the pair had remained stuck in a tight range for almost 80 days and the current consolidation has completed about 30 days. If history were to repeat itself, then the price may remain range-bound for a few more days. Hence, traders should be patient until the price breaks above or below the range. A breakout of $11,178 could start a rally with the first target objective at $12,460, while a break below $9,835 and the 200-day SMA may intensify selling as traders rush to the exit to dump their positions. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the price is trading inside a large symmetrical triangle. A breakout between half to three-fourths of the distance from the base of the triangle to the apex is considered as reliable. Therefore, the bulls and the bears might attempt a breakout of the triangle within the next few days. However, if that does not happen and the price reaches the apex of the triangle, then the pattern will be invalidated. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) closed (UTC time) below the 200-day SMA ($0.0837) on Sep. 23 but the bears could not sustain the lower levels, and the altcoin climbed back above the long-term moving average on Sep. 24. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This suggests that the bulls are aggressively defending the 200-day SMA. The price action of the past few days is showing a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern formation that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the neckline. The pattern target of this setup is $0.1331. This bullish view will come into play only after the price breaks out of the neckline. Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the current level or the neckline and drops below the 200-day SMA, it will invalidate the pattern. This could attract aggressive selling with the next support at $0.050.  ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls are struggling to push the price above the $0.1040440 overhead resistance. This shows that the bears are selling on relief rallies to this resistance. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in negative territory suggest that bears have a slight advantage in the short-term. If the price dips below $0.0898, the bears will try to sink the price to the critical support at $0.074. Conversely, if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the moving averages, a move to $0.1040440 and then to the neckline is possible. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) broke above the $97.70 overhead resistance on Sep. 29 and the retest of the breakout level was successful on Oct. 2. This shows that the level that was previously acting as a stiff resistance is now acting as a strong support. XMR/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The rising 20-day EMA ($97.15) and the RSI in the positive territory suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The first target is $113.211 and above it $121.427. Momentum is likely to pick up if the bulls can push the price above this level and the next target is at $140. This positive view will be invalidated if the XMR/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $93. Such a move could pull down the price to the 200-day SMA at $71.79. XMR/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the pair has largely been trading inside a channel for the past few days. Although the price broke above the channel, the bulls could not sustain the higher levels and the pair dropped to the support line of the channel. However, the rebound from the support line has been strong and the bulls are once again trying to push the price above the channel. If they succeed, the momentum could pick up. Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to breakout of the channel, then a gradual up-move is likely. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the channel. ATOM/USD Cosmos ( ATOM ) is showing signs of a possible reversal as it has formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above the neckline. ATOM/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This setup has a target objective of $7.4 and if this level is crossed, the up-move can retest the highs at $8.877. However, the 20-day EMA ($5) is currently flat and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. Therefore, traders may wait for the price to break above the neckline before turning positive. If the ATOM/USD pair turns down from the neckline, a drop to $4.50 and below it to the 200-day SMA ($3.675) is possible. ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls purchased the dip to the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the rise from $3.78–$5.596. The buyers will now try to push the price back above $5.596. If they achieve the breakout and sustain it, the inverse head and shoulders pattern will complete. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance and drops below the 61.8% retracement level of $4.474. Such a move could drag the price down to $3.78. VET/USD The bulls have been defending the $0.01094 support for the past few days but they have failed to sustain the higher levels, which suggests that bears are selling on rallies. Hence, VeChain ( VET ) has again dropped back to the $0.01094 support. VET/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears sink the VET/USD pair below $0.01094 support and the 200-day SMA ($0.0104), the selling is likely to intensify and a drop to $0.008 and below it to $0.0066 is possible. The 20-day EMA ($0.0128) is sloping down and the RSI has not been able to sustain above 50, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. This negative view will be invalidated if the pair again rebounds off the support and rises above $0.0160. Such a move will suggest accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. VET/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows the formation of a descending triangle, which will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $0.010940. This setup has a target objective of $0.00328. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand in the short-term. This view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off $0.010940 and rises above the downtrend line of the triangle.

Back in September 2015, the world’s largest humanitarian announced its new agenda for sustainable development. 
 
It contains 17 main targets that include tackling poverty, hunger, avoiding wasting water, fixing gender inequality and providing education.  The previous 15-year agenda that was signed by world leaders back in September 2000 produced some impressive results, reducing the number of people that live in extreme poverty by over 1 bln individuals. In order to incentivize participants, IOHK is offering $10,000 worth of ADA to developers. 
 
Only those projects that are written in Marlowe, a new language for developing financial instruments on the Cardano blockchain, can qualify for the hackathon. They will be judged by their technical merit as well as their social impact: The winning ideas will be able to seek the advice of experts from both the UN and IOHK to ensure that they are implemented in the most impactful way. IOHK is accepting new submissions until Oct. 19.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's Goguen Era to Kick Off This October: Charles Hoskinson,"During his most  recent AMA , IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson announced that the Goguen’s roadmap that will kickstart the new Cardano era was slated to be announced on Oct. 29.  
 
Similarly to Shelley, the rollout of Goguen will take place in stages as explained by Hoskinson: “It’s not the case that you flip something and you say ‘Oh, Goguen is here’[...] So, Goguen is a spectrum...A part of it has been delivered, and we're delivering more parts soon and we will announce those parts (some of them at the October update).”  As reported by U.Today, Cardano  successfully activated  the Shelley hard fork to achieve full decentralization back in July.   
 
When it comes to Goguen, Hoskinson makes it clear that is not a light switch, meaning that all updates will not be shipped overnight as some members of the community expect:  “Goguen's gonna come over a series of updates, a series of hard fork events...and each and every one of them can add more functionality to the system. ”    He further explains that metadata, one of the first functionalities of the Goguen era, has been already implemented. It allows off-chain applications to use the Cardano blockchain.      
 
More details about the stages of Goguen’s rollout will be provided at the product update on Oct. 29.       
 In other news, IOHK has renewed its partnership with Runtime Verification, a University of Illinois tech startup, by signing a “seven-figure” contract.  
 
The main purpose of their collaboration is the development of IELE, Cardano’s future virtual machine: “I will make a dedicated announcement at a later time about specific deliverables and what we gonna get out of that. But I figured I just share with you guys the really good news.”   Back in 2018, Runtime Verification and IOHK launched the IELE testnet for deploying smart contracts.",https://u.today/cardanos-goguen-era-to-kick-off-this-october-charles-hoskinson,utoday,2020-10-11,11:55:00,en
cardano,No Section,ETC Cooperative Joins Forces with IOHK to Present Six Solutions for Preventing 51 Percent Attacks,"The ETC Cooperative, a non-profit entity that supports Ethereum Classic, has collaborated with Cardano developer IOHK to enhance the security of the troubled Ethereum fork. 
 
The two organizations have published  a report  that explores possible solutions for preventing future 51 percent attacks that post an existential threat to the blockchain.    Ethereum Classic Improvement Proposals (ECIP) 1100 is going to mess up things for attackers by detecting suspicious reorganizations with the help of Modified Exponential Subjective Scoring (MESS). While it’s not the ultimate fix, this ECIP significantly raises the cost of a successful attacks, thus making them less probable. 
 
MESS, however, doesn’t address the liveliness of the protocol, and the use of blockchain timestamps makes the blockchain vulnerable to attacks on top of that. 
 
Checkpointing is another possible solution described in the report that aims to make blocks irreversible by establishing checkpoints. 
 
The most peculiar proposal is to include ETC block data into Bitcoin blocks but its miners have to be connected to the network of the Rootstock (RSK) sidechain. Meanwhile, Veriblock, an additional network, could relay blocks to the Bitcoin network to achieve a higher level of security. 
 
PirlGuard, similarly to ECIP 1100, aims to fend off 51 attacks by them more expensive for the perpetrator.    As  reported by U.Today , the Ethereum Classic blockchain suffered three 51 percent attacks back in August.   
 
In its conclusion, the report highlights that all of the above-mentioned solutions are only temporarily fixes for the Bitcoin network. “Our focus at the moment is rightly on mitigation. But let’s also ensure we remember the longer-term goal – the health and sustainable success of Ethereum Classic. Let’s move decisively to underpin the security of the network, and together look forward towards a new era of network growth, community growth and sustainable innovation.” When Ethereum 2.0 gets finally shipped, Ethereum Classic could benefit from an influx of miner that would secure its chain.",https://u.today/etc-cooperative-joins-forces-with-iohk-to-present-six-solutions-for-preventing-51-percent-attacks,utoday,2020-10-20,19:40:00,en
cardano, News ," Future elections could be held on the Cardano blockchain, says Hoskinson ","In an interview with Cointelegraph, Charles Hoskinson suggested that  a Cardano-based solution  might make blockchain voting possible for future national elections. He stated: “Not only do I believe — we've been building the infrastructure for that."" Hoskinson acknowledged that the road to Cardano-based elections would be gradual and require a number of experiments. He suggested that it could start with third parties using the network for their primaries, before escalating to municipal and state elections. From there, he supposed the network could be utilized in national elections for countries that struggle with legacy systems: “I think it's entirely possible in three to five years that we can take that test back and sell it to the government of Ethiopia, for example, or the government of Georgia. And they're in the business of looking for new voting systems because they're having so much problem with census and registration and fresh and free elections.” He also noted that IOHK has an entire team based in Lancaster, England that regularly publishes e-voting research. Hoskinson admitted, however, that scaling a blockchain-based voting system would be tricky. Creating a platform that is sufficiently focused on privacy and auditability would require a lot of cryptographic overhead: “If you're just doing a general election where you don't care about privacy, you're counting votes, you can do a billion people. When you want an election where I can verify it, but I can't prove to an outside party that's who I voted for, but at least I know my vote is counted and I want my privacy and I want a paper ballot back up. And then that's when you get into a situation where you go from billions to thousands, and you have to shard it.” Meanwhile, Project Catalyst has  allowed Cardano entrepreneurs to pitch projects  to the community for funding. Catalyst lays a path for the type of on-chain governance that is expected to be implemented when Cardano enters its Voltaire era. The video of this interview will  be available on Cointelegraph’s YouTube channel  soon.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/future-elections-could-be-held-on-the-cardano-blockchain-says-hoskinson,cointelegraph,2020-10-30,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Reaches Major Decentralization Milestone,"Over 50 percent of all blocks on the Cardano network are now being validated by public stake pools, according to  an announcement  shared by computer software company IOHK. This marks a major decentralization milestone for the proof of stake (PoS) blockchain created by Ethereum cofounder and IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson. 
 
Cardano laid the groundwork for decentralizing its network with the long-awaited implementation of the Shelley hard fork that took place on July 29. 
 
Its launch allowed all owners of the native ADA token to delegate their holdings to community-controlled stake pools and earn staking rewards. 
 
Federated IOHK nodes had full control over block production during the centralized Byron era. After the Shelley mainnet entered epoch 3, the very first block was minted by a stake pool. The level of centralization continues to decrease with each new epoch. On Friday, Nov. 6, the community is expected to mint the majority of all blocks. 
 
In an  August blog post , IOHK's technology manager, Kevin Hammond, claimed that it would be ""a tipping point"" for Cardano. 
 
The end goal is to have all blocks produced by stake polls, which will make governance completely decentralized, according to Hammond: IOG will continue to run its own stake pools that will produce blocks in line with the stake they attract, just like any other pools. But these will no longer have any special role in maintaining the Cardano network. It will also, of course, delegate a substantial amount of its stake to community pools. Simultaneously, the voting mechanism will be enabled, and it will no longer be possible to increase d and ‘re-centralize’ Cardano. At the time of writing, Cardano has already reached  1,208 stake pools , surpassing its initial target of 1,000. 
 
On numerous occasions, Hoskinson has claimed that Cardano could become 100 times more decentralized than Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency.",https://u.today/cardano-reaches-major-decentralization-milestone,utoday,2020-11-02,14:17:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Developer IOHK Sponsors Non-Profit That Aims to Broaden Haskell Adoption ,"Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), an organization devoted to supporting the Cardano blockchain, has become one of the first sponsors of the newly formed Haskell Foundation, according to a  Nov. 4 blog post .      
 
By injecting funds into this non-profit, IOHK — which is spearheaded by none other than Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson — aims to expand the adoption of the Haskell programming language.
 The launch of the new foundation was announced at the 2020  Haskell eXchange virtual conference . British computer scientist Simon Peyton Jones underscored the importance of funding for volunteers who contribute to Haskell development:       “The last of these unmet needs that I wanted to raise is funding. So, it's really hard for volunteers, no matter how well motivated they are, who have other day jobs to reliably sustain mission critical infrastructure.” Jones hopes that the foundation will serve as a “credible donation target.”   
 
The main goal of the foundation is to empower the community and make it more effective while sticking to Haskell’s core principles.     To that end, Cardano has put money into tutorials and training across the globe.      The foundation’s organization will include the foundation board, the executive director, and working groups led by volunteers.      
 
While Ethereum’s smart contracts are written in Serenity, creating one on the Cardano blockchain will require knowing Haskell programming language. Since the latter is mainly used in academia, it is quite challenging to find programmers who can code with it. ",https://u.today/cardano-developer-iohk-sponsors-non-profit-that-aims-to-broaden-haskell-adoption,utoday,2020-11-04,19:26:00,en
cardano, News , CZ and Vitalik agree blockchain-based voting is a must ,"Binance’s chief executive Changpeng Zhao or CZ and Ethereum’s co-founder Vitalik Buterin are in furious agreement that a new blockchain-based voting system is required to improve democratic processes in the United States. But it won’t be as easy to implement as one might think. Responding to prolonged uncertainty over the result of the controversial 2020 U.S. presidential election, CZ  tweeted  that now is the right time for developers to build “a blockchain based mobile voting app.”  Binance’s CEO argued that such a voting system would reduce the time taken to confirm the outcome of an election, enhance voters’ privacy, and eliminate questions surrounding the validity of results. CZ  urged  developers to begin working on such a system: “Develop something now, get it approved (obviously hardest step), and get 300 million plus (fully KYC’ed) users in 4 years time. Any capable developer should be willing to do it ‘for free.’” Buterin shared the post, although he  added  that it isn’t going to be an easy task: “The technical challenges with making a secure cryptographic voting system are significant (and often underestimated), but IMO this is directionally 100% correct.” He clarified that a cryptographic approach doesn’t necessarily mean a blockchain approach, although he explained it could be used to “maximize anti-censorship guarantees.”  While such systems can resolve the question of whether every vote has been counted, they aren’t yet able to solve the problem of determining whether the votes were valid in the first place. Ultimately, Buterin  said , it shouldn’t be hard to improve on the current system: Beating 73% accuracy is not hard. https://t.co/zt9bn1IBQZ — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin)  November 5, 2020 
 
 Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also believes blockchain voting is the right path to travel, last week suggesting that Cardano had been “ building the infrastructure ” for this specific use case. Not everyone is on board. CEO and founder of MyCrypto Taylor Monahan  countered  that with the number of security issues facing current blockchain and cryptocurrency networks, the community is not ready for “blockchain democracy.”  She argued, “We cannot come close to securing fake internet money that tech geeks play with and manipulate for fun,”  citing  initial coin offerings, scams, ponzi schemes, hacks and insecure smart contracts among the current hurdles: “It’s not [because] people want money. It’s because people want power. Money = power. Votes = power.” Last week, Overstock chief Jonathon Johnson said that Voatz, the voting app backed by Overstock’s subsidiary Medici Ventures, could have solved the problems facing the current election during an earnings call on Oct 29.  However, Voatz has been criticized for exhibiting security vulnerabilities, with MIT security researchers  condemning the app’s cybersecurity safeguards  earlier this year. Last month, Russia appeared to have successfully  used a blockchain-based voting system  built on Waves, recording almost 300,000 votes.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cz-and-vitalik-agree-blockchain-based-voting-is-a-must,cointelegraph,2020-11-05,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano Hours Away from ""Epochal"" Decentralization Milestone","The Cardano network is just hours away from reaching a tipping point of centralization. 
 
According to  a Nov. 6 tweet  posted by IOHK, the Shelley testnet is scheduled to enter its next epoch at 21:44 UTC when public stake pools will become responsible for producing the majority of all blocks.          Prior to the rollout of the Shelley hardfork, Cardano would operate on a federated basis when nodes owned by IOHK, Cardano Foundation, and Emurgo were in full control of block production. The d parameter, which measures how decentralized the network is, has been decreasing with each epoch from 1 to 0.5     As reported by U.Today, stake pools gained started validating half of all blocks on Nov. 2, reaching parity with federated nodes.      IOHK's technical lead, Kevin Hammond, claimed that Cardano’s decentralization  would be inevitable  if the d parameter dropped below 5. This is exactly what’s going to happen in mere hours. Prior to that, Cardano developers had to implement community voting and P2Pool discovery.        
 
By the end of the current era, Cardano aims to become at least  50 times  more decentralized than other popular blockchains including Bitcoin. 
 
When the d parameter eventually drops to 0, block production will be fully controlled by the community as explained by Hammond:   “This journey, which began with Shelley and the implementation of the d parameter, will take Cardano through a path of evolutionary stages in which the network will become progressively more and more decentralized, as d decays.”",https://u.today/cardano-hours-away-from-epochal-decentralization-milestone,utoday,2020-11-06,17:58:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano's Goguen Era Inching Closer. These Are Latest Dev Updates,"Goguen, the forthcoming era of the Cardano blockchain, is inching closer to its full implementation. In the most recent  rollout update , two Cardano project managers provided some important updates on the development progress.   The Goguen era will bring smart contracts and native tokens to the Cardano blockchain. 
 
According to Cardano’s Volodymyr Hulchenko, the node teams continue to deliver on adding native tokens and token locking features. The developers have also implemented basic CLI syntax, which is a structure of native tokens and commands used by users.    Dimitris Poulpoulous, the second project manager, states that they are now close to opening up the pre-production environment that will make it possible to create and distribute native tokens on Cardano. Poulpoulous also spoke about the ERC20 converter, the tool that allows managing the tokens on the Cardano chain. It allows migrating tokens from other blockchains.   A roadmap  released in late October  shows that the Goguen era is expected to kick off in Q1 2021 when the native token standard will be deployed to a test environment following the pre-production stage.              The team is also finalizing the cost model of Plutus, the platforms that will power smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. It is also working on producing an explanation document for the ledger model.  When it comes to the Plutus application, they are currently focused on refreshing the Plutus Playground, a web-based environment that lets developers work on an emulated version of Cardano, according to Poulpoulous: “Last but not least, we are also working on improving the emulator, including performance and usability.” The beta release scope of Marlowe, a specialized language for Cardano’s smart contracts, is almost finalized.",https://u.today/cardanos-goguen-era-inching-closer-these-are-latest-dev-updates,utoday,2020-11-27,06:14:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Prepares to Integrate Token Locking Before Introducing Smart Contracts,"In a recent blog post, the IOHK team  spread the word  about the upcoming major upgrade for Goguen that will allow Cardano to implement token locking prior to the launch of native digital assets (other than ADA) and smart contracts. The blog post says that token locking is the next protocol upgrade the team intends to execute on the Cardano blockchain, and this will be the next big update for Goguen. This will take a small tech update to the consensus protocol and will allow integrating of smart contracts and creating digital assets — except ADA, which already runs on Cardano — on the ledger. This will also support the voting mechanism and add an important piece of governance functionality (Voltaire). After the upgrade, users will be able to reserve ADA and other tokens that will appear in the future for voting, running smart contracts and so on, and users will be unable to use those tokens to make a profit. The article likens token locking to holding shares and earning dividends at the end of a year unless the user decides to sell those shares earlier and lose all dividends; tokens will have to be locked for an entire year. The token locking feature is necessary to implement complex smart contracts, which will come later on. The process of implementing the token locking feature will go unnoticed for ADA holders, the blog post says. Daedalus and Yoroi wallets will be upgraded to the new feature automatically, and this will require no action from users. However, all Cardano nodes will have to download the updated version of the code to support token locking and to reach consensus. After this feature is implemented on the Cardano mainnet, hard forks after that will bring options for issuing digital assets and using smart contracts. Those will also function via token locking. The trials will begin in December, as per the source.",https://u.today/cardano-prepares-to-integrate-token-locking-before-introducing-smart-contracts,utoday,2020-12-02,13:59:00,en
cardano, News , Upcoming Cardano hard fork to introduce 'token locking' ahead of Goguen ,"IOHK, the development arm behind Cardano, recently announced a new hard fork of the protocol scheduled for mid-December.  Kevin Hammond, a software engineer at IOHK,  revealed  this week that Cardano will undergo a hard fork later this month as part of its transition to the Goguen development era. Although most observers associate hard forks with trauma, Hammond said that these events are handled much differently on Cardano: “[...] Cardano handles hard forks automatically, without stopping block production. This gives a uniquely smooth upgrade process that allows new features to be introduced easily and evolve the platform’s capabilities.” The hard fork is designed to introduce new efficiencies to the Cardano network and enable the “token locking” feature, which records how a token is being utilized on the ledger.  Hammond explained: “Locking, in this case, means ‘reserving’ a certain number of tokens for a specified period of time so they cannot be disposed of to gain a benefit (such as voting, or running a smart contract).” Hammond says  Cardano  will soon enable integration of other custom tokens into the blockchain that can be used alongside ADA, its native cryptocurrency.  Launched in 2017 by  Charles Hoskinson , Cardano has been dubbed by proponents as the “Ethereum killer” for its scaling capacity and advanced smart contract features. The project is known for its time-consuming roadmap that has so far focused on blockchain foundations and decentralization. The Goguen era kicks off smart contract integration.  ADA is one of the top-performing large-cap cryptocurrencies of the past year, a sign that investors are rallying around Cardano’s development progress. The ADA token has returned more than 400% year-to-date, including a recent brush with multiyear highs.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/upcoming-cardano-hard-fork-to-introduce-token-locking-ahead-of-goguen,cointelegraph,2020-12-04,00:00:00,en
cardano,Tech,Cardano to Launch Hard Fork Before Next Major Development Phase,"IOHK, the development team behind public blockchain project Cardano,  said  it is set to launch a hard fork in December as part of the transition to the third development phase of the protocol.  Dubbed ""Goguen,"" the third phase will be focused on the protocol’s integration of smart contracts after building Cardano’s foundation and decentralizing its system in the first two phases.  The hard fork will introduce the token-locking mechanism, one of its most significant new functions, to the mainnet. It will enable the network’s smart contracts to support certain conditions such as making users hold tokens for a fixed period of time in order to complete a contract. While only having a slight impact on the actual ledger, the token-locking function will prepare the platform for smart contracts and the creation of assets that run on Cardano, Kevin Hammond, the company’s software engineer, said in a statement. In addition, the upgrade will bring custom tokens into the network besides its native  ADA  token, Hammond said.  Founded in 2015, Cardano has experienced multiple hard forks to evolve through its five development phases, according to its  roadmap . After the Goguen era, the protocol will go through the last two phases, Basho and Voltaire, to improve its scaling and governance functions.  ",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/12/05/cardano-to-launch-hard-fork-before-next-major-development-phase/,coindesk,2020-12-05,22:38:00,en

Input Output HK software developers shared an update of Project Catalyst's progress and disclosed its two flagship products. In its latest Twitter ""megathread,"" Input Output HK announced that the first-ever community referendum with $250,000 in ADA will take place very soon. Thus, the most promising early-stage products will receive funding to bring their ideas closer to mainnet. Today, on Dec. 8, Project Catalyst starts its ""Festival of Ideas"" phase. Its team will pitch the most interesting and viable ideas daily to keep the community informed about Project Catalyst's residents. The first one is Liqwid, a pioneering DeFi product built on top of the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. It promotes itself as ""Cardano DeFi Lending Markets"" and offers instruments for noncustodial liquidity provision. Like existing LP environments, it will allow its users to earn on their idle liquidity. Another flagship release of Project Catalyst includes Workshop Maybe, a unique educational ecosystem focused on Cardano (ADA) decentralized solutions. New ideas will be released by Project Catalyst day by day. Also, its team is certain that, in the coming year of 2021, many more referenda with millions of dollars in ADA equivalents will be organized to bootstrap the development and adoption of Cardano-focused products. As covered by U.Today previously, Project Catalyst is an unparalleled initiative by Cardano's IOHK launched without fanfare in early Q3, 2020. Very soon after going public, it inked a partnership with the United Nations and launched a hackathon to address Sustainable Development goals.

cardano, News , DeFi could be coming to Cardano  ,"IOHK, the  development company behind Cardano , has named a DeFi lending protocol as one of its so-called Project Catalyst ideas — sending a strong message that decentralized finance applications could be coming to the project's blockchain.  In a series of Twitter posts, IOHK  said  Tuesday that several promising ideas tied to Project Catalyst will be revealed in the coming days. Project Catalyst is a public fund that is  intended  to bring “research, social experiments and community consent to establish an open, democratic culture within the Cardano community.” The first Project Catalyst candidate to be announced is Liqwid, a DeFi lending market that allows participants to earn interest on deposits and borrow assets directly on the Cardano blockchain.  In an October Medium post, Liqwid architect Dewayne Cameron  described  his protocol as “an open source automated liquidity protocol for lending.”  He explained: “(1) Liqwid Finance is not a bank ; it’s open source financial infrastructure (2) Liqwid does not have a “target region/user” ; Liqwid’s functional implementation is an open source lending protocol on a distributed decentralized cloud, by design this means global.” The market for decentralized finance has seen a groundswell of activity in the last six months. At the time of writing, the total value locked in DeFi projects was $14.6 billion spread across lending, derivatives, asset, payments and DEX markets.  “Our team is competing in the Cardano Project Catalyst grant rounds to receive our seed-funding which will finance our core developers plus our dev partners Appinventiv and Tweag,” Cameron tells Cointelegraph.  He adds:  “[...] we are excited to show the DeFi space what a no-VC, community-led DAO project on Cardano can deliver in comparison to the VC-backed Ethereum DeFi protocols we see today.” Liqwid kicks off its development phase next week, with testing scheduled for the end of Q1 2021. Although the official launch is somewhat dependent on the deployment of Cardano smart contracts, Cameron says he's optimistic that Liqwid's roadmap aligns with IOHK's planned rollout of smart contract functionality.  The official Liqwid launch on Cardano mainnet is of course somewhat dependent on the official launch of smart contracts at Cardano’s Goguen go-live but with the 1st Goguen protocol update coming this week, our team is optimistic our v1. development roadmap aligns well with IOHK’s development roadmap for introducing complete smart contract functionality on-chain (mid-late Q1 2021). In addition to Liqwid, IOHK on Tuesday named Maybe Workshop — a project-based learning resource — as another Project Catalyst candidate. The best ideas, as selected by Cardano community members, will receive up to $250,000 worth of ADA to further develop their projects.  IOHK says millions of dollars worth of ADA will be released in 2021 as part of future funding rounds — “from content to community resources, Dapps to Defi.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-could-be-coming-to-cardano,cointelegraph,2020-12-08,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Announces First DeFi Project as It Plans to Take on Ethereum ,"Cardano is making serious inroads into the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry.   
 
In a  Dec. 10 tweet , Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) has announced its tie-up with peer-to-peer cryptocurrency exchange Bondly Finance. Bondly is the very first DeFi project that will be powered by Cardano. This, according to the announcement, marks a “huge step” in making DeFi mainstream.      As part of the partnership, BONDLY, the native token of the protocol, will migrate to Cardano from rivaling Polkadot.     According to the most recent  Goguen rollout update , the team of developers is inching closer to implementing native tokens and industry-scale smart contracts.     In late September, AI firm SingularityNET  also revealed  its plan to ditch Ethereum for Cardano or adopt a multi-chain approach.
 Charles Hoskinson, the Ethereum co-founder who went on mastermind Cardano, was hardly acting coy about his DeFi ambitions. 
 
As  reported by U.Today , the eccentric entrepreneur mentioned that he was “obsessed” with that burgeoning industry niche back in August. Taking an obvious jab at Ethereum, Hoskinson predicted that Cardano would have more luck in DeFi than the first-mover.     You actually want to be in the imitator the second-mover category for DeFi, and I think we'll have a lot more luck than the first movers did in the space. The Ethereum DeFi ecosystem has been plagued by scaling issues, and this is where Cardano wants to seize an opportunity during the forthcoming Goguen era. 
 
The successful launch the Beacon Chain, the cornerstone of  the Ethereum 2.0 proof-of-stake network, will, however, make this rivalry much more challenging for Cardano.",https://u.today/cardano-announces-first-defi-project-as-it-plans-to-take-on-ethereum,utoday,2020-12-10,20:00:00,en
cardano, News , First DeFi project on Cardano bridges from Polkadot ,"Decentralized e-commerce platform Bondly will be the first decentralized finance project to run on the Cardano blockchain as part of the platform’s roll-out of the  Goguen  smart contract functionality. In the Twitter  announcement , the firm that built the Cardano platform, IOHK, called the partnership, “A huge step in continuing both companies’ mission to bring decentralized finance to the masses.” The Goguen roll-out, which is expected to be completed by Feb. 2021, allows decentralized applications to be built on the network and ushers in the integration of DeFi projects to Cardano’s ecosystem. IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson said the introduction of apps like Bondly onto the platform will allow, “DeFi to live up to its true potential, ultimately scaling to completely replace the global digital financial system.” As the upgrade ramps up, Bondly will add its cryptocurrency BONDLY to Cardano to complement the existing Polkadot platform. It will also bridge the company’s two core products — over the counter trading platform BSwap, and e-commerce platform BONDProtect, which provides decentralized escrow and buyer protection. Unlike Ethereum where ETH transactions are given more importance than those made with ERC-20 tokens, the Goguen update will not prioritize Cardano transactions over other tokens issued on the platform. This provides better performance for non-native tokens, which will inherit all security and smart contract features of Cardano’s native token ADA. Following the full implementation of Cardano’s Goguen upgrade, the platform’s Marlowe Project will be initiated. The initiative will enable peer-to-peer loans and contracts for difference (CFDs) directly on Cardano. Platform users will be able to launch ready-made templates of DeFi contracts and digital assets, transferring the terms of the contracts on the platform. Earlier this week, the company  announced  another DeFi project, Liqwid, as a potential candidate to receive $250,000 in ADA funding as part of its Project Catalyst. Hoskinson has always had grand ambitions for Cardano. In July, 2020, he  suggested  that Cardano would become a leader in the DeFi sector. Six months earlier, the IOHK CEO predicted in a YouTube  AMA  that Cardano will replace Bitcoin as the number one cryptocurrency by the end of the year. That hasn’t happened yet ... but there’s still three weeks to go.  Update, 13:30 UTC: A previous version of this article incorrectly asserted that Bondly will no longer be present on Polkadot.

cardano, News ," Africa is the future of DeFi, argues Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson ","In one of his frequent Youtube missives to his following, CEO of IOHK — the developers behind the Cardano Blockchain — Charles Hoskinson revealed that the company’s long-term developmental focus will hinge on Africa, going so far as to say the world’s second-most populous continent might be the future for decentralized finance (DeFi) development.  ““When we ask ourselves, ‘who will be the consumers of DeFi who will be in need of identity systems and payment systems and new ways of representing equities’ — will it be the ossified, highly regulated markets of the western world, which are invitation-only […] or will it be the agile and nimble countries of Africa, Southeast Asia, who have no incumbencies and are desperately to compete and thus are open and friendly to retooling and ideas?” “Given that the human capital, physical capital, and economics are all moving in the right direction, it is my belief that Africa will be the most promising economic environment in the next ten years,” Hoskinson concluded. Hoskinson isn’t alone in thinking that the next wave of DeFi’s adoption will begin in Africa.  In a previous interview with Cointelegraph , Patrick Rawson of blockchain think tank Curve Labs said that reaching “the last mile” of users will require DeFi developers to tailor their products to un-and-underbanked users.  The specifics of how Cardano will grow in the world’s second most populous continent were scarce, however. Hoskinson teased that Cardano has successfully built “networks and relationships” which provide the blockchain project with “strategic partners and relationships and political access in the right places.”  He added that he believed these connections will lead to “flagship deals,” which will in turn help to land “much larger deals.” While he notes that there is $5.6 trillion in wealth across the continent, little of which is available to global markets, he offered little by way of a roadmap towards Cardano capturing that value.  The founder did promise a future, dedicated Youtube episode which will lay out the strategies and details of Cardano’s Africa rollout with greater clarity and strategy specifics.  “As we see that 5.6 trillion in wealth, it is my hope that the representation of that wealth will live on the Cardano blockchain,” he said.  Hoskinson previously  discussed Cardano’s Africa push in an AMA with the community , where he did reveal the details of contracts that IOHK has managed to win so far, as well as one instance where the company was underbid. IOHK also houses its  headquarters  in Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/africa-is-the-future-of-defi-argues-cardano-s-charles-hoskinson,cointelegraph,2020-12-12,00:00:00,en

As part of the partnership, WBL will integrate Cardano’s blockchain data into Wolfram Alpha, allowing developers to integrate external data into Cardano’s smart contracts. The new partnership will specifically address work on the so-called “avant-garde oracles,” which the companies believe are a necessary component to build advanced smart contracts.

cardano, News ," Eth2 becomes the fourth-largest staking network, and it keeps growing ","Ethereum 2.0 has already emerged as the fourth-largest proof-of-stake network by total value locked in staking within roughly six weeks of the  Eth2 deposit contract going live . Despite withdrawal functionality not yet enabled and no precise estimation for its full launch date, nearly $1 billion worth of Ether ( ETH ) has already been designated for staking. According to crypto data aggregator Staking Rewards, more than 1.5 million Ether or 1.35% of Ethereum’s supply has been  deposited  for staking. Ether staking rewards are currently estimated at approximately 13.20%, meaning that a single stake of 32 ETH would earn $2,725 over one year at the current price of around $645. Polkadot,  the brain-child of Ethereum co-founder Gavin Wood , is currently the largest staking network by total value locked. Since Polkadot’s mainnet launch in May, the network has seen 67.51% of its supply designated for staking, valued at nearly $3.4 billion. Cardano, a rival network from  fellow Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson , ranks as a close second, with 65.53% of its supply locked since July for a staking TVL of $3.37 billion.  Tezos launched staking in 2018 , and has the highest rate of network participation among staking networks ranking among the top 50 crypto assets by capitalization with 79.43%.

cardano, News , Cardano to open up to Ethereum Solidity devs with new initiative ,"Solidity, a major programming language for writing smart contracts, will soon become compatible with the Cardano blockchain. According to a Thursday announcement on the Cardano developers' website, Cardano devs are now  opening up  Cardano to the Solidity and Ethereum community through an interoperable platform that uses native Ethereum code. As part of the effort, Cardano developers are planning to restart and accelerate their K Ethereum Virtual Machine, or KEVM, developer network program. The devnet envisions an EVM running within the so-called “K framework” — a system for specifying and creating languages and virtual machines. K intends to enable developers to define or implement formal semantics of a programming language in an intuitive, modular manner. “K also generates an executable, 'correct by construction VM' from its formal specification, which is fast and powerful enough to run real programs and smart contracts,” the announcement notes. The system is designed to help create code that is secure and reliable from the start. Once implemented, the K framework aims to bridge Cardano's blockchain with Solidity, enabling developers to work across both ecosystems. According to a Wednesday blog post from Charles Hoskinson-founded tech startup IOHK, the KEVM devnet is  designed  to enable full compatibility with Ethereum. “Because Solidity is a high-level language similar to JavaScript and C++, it cannot be directly executed by the EVM. Solidity programs must be compiled to assembly language (EVM bytecode) first, so they can run on the KEVM,” IOHK’s marketing director, Tim Harrison, wrote. Alongside KEVM, Cardano developers also plan to deploy other devnets such as Glow and IELE. Developed by MuKn, a partner within the Cardano ecosystem, Glow will be the next devnet to be deployed, according to Harrison. “Most of the core development work is now done, ready for final QA and deployment in January 2021,” he said. The IELE virtual machine was developed by Cardano community partner Runtime Verification and intends to provide a more secure system than the EVM.

There are two major factors behind ADA’s strong upsurge throughout the past several weeks. First, most major cryptocurrencies saw large rallies following BTC’s uptrend to $36,400 and Cardano has some important network upgrades lined up in 2021. ADA/USDT daily price chart (Binance). Source: TradingView.com Excitement builds over Cardano's smart contract deployment Cardano launched the Shelley mainnet in 2020, kickstarting the growth of Cardano as a proof-of-stake blockchain protocol. The release of Shelley was a major milestone for Cardano, which led the overall sentiment around ADA to improve throughout 2020. However, functional smart contracts are yet to be deployed on the Cardano blockchain. When smart contracts are live, large-scale decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and other decentralized applications would be able to launch on top of Cardano. Researchers at Binance Academy said that the release of functional smart contracts is a part of the Goguen update. Considering the significance of this network upgrade, the market sentiment around ADA appears to be improving. The report  read : “As of December 2020, functional smart contracts cannot be deployed on the blockchain platform. As part of the roadmap, this will roll out as a part of the Goguen update. Following Goguen, the Basho era focuses on optimization of scalability and interoperability, and the Voltaire era introduces a treasury system to address governance.” Smart contracts on Cardano are different from other blockchains because they allow developers to code self-executing smart contracts based on programmed conditions. This allows developers and decentralized applications to be more flexible. Emurgo, a blockchain solutions firm,  wrote : “These contracts, when written on the Cardano blockchain, offer the value of giving full visibility to all participants of the contract, while also being extremely secure and self-executing according to the programmed conditions.” The current move is largely technical Although Cardano has major upgrades on the horizon, no large upgrades were announced during the period of the rally. Technical analysts and traders anticipated a large ADA rally in late December 2020, as large-cap crypto assets rallied in tandem. On Dec. 30, Michael van de Poppe, a full-time trader at the Amsterdam Stock Exchange, said he believes Cardano would do well in the first quarter of 2021. He  wrote : “One of the platforms that will do well in coming quarter, I think will be #Cardano. Majors are probably running first and this is definitely a major. As long as $0.11 holds (or $0.15), I think we'll continue towards $0.27 and/or $0.40.” A combination of technical factors and the expectations of the release of functional smart contracts in 2021 likely fueled the rally.  In the near term, analysts say that as long as BTC consolidates above $34,000 and shows technical momentum, large-cap altcoins, like Cardano, are expected to perform strongly.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-s-market-cap-flips-bitcoin-cash-bch-after-ada-rallies-by-100,cointelegraph,2021-01-07,00:00:00,en

Who's actually going to do peer-to-peer insurance? Who's actually gonna do peer-to-peer payments? I got news for you, not a guy living in New York”, pointed out Hoskinson in an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph.  Cardano, the decentralized cryptocurrency network founded by Hoskinson, intends to take the lead in the DeFi space by developing partnerships in the African continent.  According to Hoskinson, DeFi products lack a significant customer base and the field has no chance at gaining traction in the West because of a cumbersome regulatory environment.  On the contrary, developing countries offer a much more flexible regulatory framework which facilitates crypto innovation.  “There's no JPMorgan Chase. There's no big massive legacy financial system that dominates and controls”, he pointed out.

Once the club of companies ready to build on Cardano (ADA) is locked and loaded, the codebase for Plutus will be available in open-source repositories. Then, the canonical ""design patterns"" of Cardano's smart contract usage will be disclosed, as well as best practices for ADA-based decentralized applications (dApps). Mr. Hoskinson is sure that the upcoming testing will be ""fun."" Many developers are going to replace Ethereum (ETH) by Cardano (ADA) as a core smart contracts ecosystem for their dApps. For instance, flagship blockchain AI project, SingularityNET,  announced  such a plan in September 2020. Also, native Cardano-based token and blockchain emulator releases are right around the corner, as U.Today previously reported. Cardano (ADA) is on the road to the Goguen era with full decentralization and smart conracts functionality. It increases the decentralization of staking and underlines the focus on ""fair"" distribution of staking rewards instead of large-scale pool domination.

In private comments with Cointelegraph, Joshua Frank, founder of The Tie, said that chatter regarding an “interoperability bridge between Cardano and IOTA” that began making the rounds on Jan. 2 seems to have corresponded with the upward price movement and a relatively large increase in tweets.  This is referring to a recent discussion on Iota's discord in which project co-founder Dominik Schiener was asked if the Iota Foundation was interested in developing a “bridge to Cardano.” In response, Schiener stated, “Yeh 100%. Once we’re ready I’ll reach out to Charles again.” According to Frank:  “24 hours after the idea started being discussed Cardano saw a 63% increase in tweet volume and price surged 27% vs. USD and 25% vs. BTC, suggesting that this was an uncorrelated move.” ADA price vs. tweet volume. Source:  The Tie Development enters the Gougen phase Cardano’s roadmap indicates that the project recently transitioned from the Shelly era to the Goguen era.  The Shelly era brought decentralization to the core of the network and enabled ADA holders to stake and delegate their tokens to earn rewards.  Now that the project has entered the Goguen era, the focus of development is on the integration of smart contracts and the ability to build decentralized applications, or DApps, on the network.  The addition of smart contracts and DApps opens a whole new realm of functionalities for the Cardano network, including the ability to create decentralized finance applications.  In a recent  conversation with Cointelegraph , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson opined on the future of DeFi and how the team plans to “take the lead in the DeFi space by developing partnerships in the African continent.”  According to Hoskinson, the real potential of DeFi will be realized in developing countries where he sees the potential to acquire 100 million new users within the next three years.

Once the Goguen phase of Cardano progress goes live in mainnet, it will be able to onboard smart contracts for decentralized applications (dApps) and decentralized financial protocols (DeFis). Now, all enthusiasts are invited to deploy their contracts in the Plutus Playground devnet environment. According to an official announcement by Input Output HK, the software company behind Cardano's blockchain solutions, the new testing environment Plutus Playground is up and running. Based on Haskell principles, it allows all developers to write and deploy test versions of their smart contracts for Cardano (ADA). The new release of Plutus Playground requires no additional installations as it works directly in a browser. Input Output HK added tutorials on writing and compiling Cardano's smart contracts. Also, the Plutus team implemented a new user interface to advance the developer experience of writing smart contracts for Cardano (ADA). Like all of Cardano's previous Goguen devnets, Plutus Playground includes editor, simulator and transactions modes. While editor mode allows the coder to write and edit software, the simulator displays the behavior of the smart contract on Cardano (ADA) blockchain. All transactions related to the activity of certain smart contracts are also displayed with mainnet-like configurations. Primarily, Cardano's Plutus Playground targets companies of all sizes, governments, ADA token holders and entrepreneurs as the audience of its experiments. The release of Plutus Playground paves the way to Goguen, a stage of Cardano (ADA) blockchain progress at which the fully decentralized blockchain starts running smart contracts. The ongoing stage, Shelley, was activated on July 31, 2020, and brought ADA staking options for Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) is actively searching for developers ready to run smart contracts on it.

In 2021, the Cardano (ADA) price added 133.5%. Compared to the lows of Black Thursday in Crypto (March 13, 2020), the Cardano (ADA) price increased 18x. This impressive result has been achieved by Cardano (ADA) amidst a powerful ""altcoin season"" that catalyzes the prices of all large-caps. Yesterday, Binance Coin (BNB), native asset of leading crypto exchange Binance,  printed  a new all-time high over $51, while today, Ethereum (ETH) is changing hands at a record-breaking price. This rally was preceded by two marvelous pumps of Dogecoin (DOGE) and XRP. The DOGE pump was, probably, the fastest 1,000 percent run in crypto history, as it took less than 24 hours. According to some analysts, the profits of DOGE traders  inspired  a short but powerful upsurge of XRP. In regard to Cardano (ADA), these price fluctuations are followed by string technological background.

cardano, News , Cardano Foundation CEO says blockchain could prevent GME-type showdowns ,"The r ecent GameStop saga  — a financial spectacle that was a good deal more  contradictory  than a straight-up ""David vs. Goliath"" tale of  Redditor retail investors  vs. predatory hedge funds — has sparked numerous blockchain commentators to step in to try to redirect attention to  their bet  on a future overhaul of the financial sector. Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, is attempting to  shift the conversation away  from heated arguments over the balance of forces,  rules of the game , or legitimate tactics in the recent showdown between the little guys, the hedge funders, intermediaries, Robinhood and regulators.  Some participants in the meme-stock frenzy saw themselves as  quasi-i nsurgents, trolling the system using its own tools. While many have criticized their strategy and narrative on political grounds, Gregaard focuses instead on technology, transparency and rationalization as the answer to the system's ills. His take attempts both to appeal to the popular cynicism and cunning that was expressed by the redditors, and to the self-interest of institutional and systemic actors themselves. Analyzing Robinhood's controversial decision to  tighten trading  amid the GameStop affair, Gregaard argued: “We now know that the real issue which forced Robinhood to set higher margin requirements on certain positions was the intensity of trading activity. This overloaded the capacity of multiple actors across the buying, selling, and settlement process. In turn, this led to a backlog of settlement requests and subsequent liquidity issues for clearing houses.” This decision, Gregaard continues, was felt first and most keenly by the “cogs in the machine,” i.e. the brokerages. He claims that if post-trade processing had been carried out using a public blockchain ledger, bottlenecks in the settlement process would have been visible on-chain to all market participants, spreading information more evenly and providing insight into where the “market inefficiencies” were. Gregaard cited the endorsement of Big Four auditor PriceWaterHouseCoopers and their opinion that the technology could “cut operational complexity and provide a single verified source of truth,” in his summary. Beyond transparency, Gregaard also made the case that the speed and efficiency of the clearing and settlement process would in itself be improved by choosing a disintermediated and distributed system like blockchain. Not only would much of the behind-the-scenes action be more visible to everyday users, and streamlined for back-end institutions, but barriers to instant asset settlement would be removed and cumbersome intermediary processes made redundant. Gregaard told Cointelegraph that irrespective of recent events, “there are opportunities for synergy and working partnerships between traditional financial institutions and decentralized ledger technology leaders.” He further noted that “As the blockchain industry matures, so will regulations. These may lead to welcoming legislation that allows blockchain to provide an immutable audit trail of all transactions.” The CEO continued: ""With open-source blockchain infrastructure, like Cardano, anyone is free to explore our code and develop solutions to be deployed on our blockchain. This is but one potential use case of where we believe we can help innovate, and we welcome changemakers to our ecosystem who want to push this forward.""",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-foundation-ceo-says-blockchain-could-prevent-gme-type-showdowns,cointelegraph,2021-02-08,00:00:00,en

To steal increasingly high-priced Cardano (ADA) tokens, they run fake giveaways and deploy impersonating applications. According to a recent tweet by Input Output HK, a scam application impersonating Cardano's (ADA) full node software, Daedalus, was discovered in the Google Play online marketplace. Input Output HK reiterated that Daedalus is a full-node software and therefore cannot be released as a smartphone application. The ""light"" version of Cardano (ADA) wallet is dubbed Yoroi.

","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price has been consolidating in recent days, which kickstarted the rest of the cryptocurrency market. This frequently happens as Bitcoin starts to consolidate, it gives the chance for the rest of the market to catch up. Cardano ( ADA ) is one such cryptocurrency, which gained 170% in February alone with its price nearing $1 for the first time ever.  Cardano's BTC pair is showing signs of life ADA/BTC 3-day chart. Source:  TradingView However, lots of information can be derived from the BTC chart as it’s just starting to wake up from its bear market slumber. The recent run created a new higher high — the highest since July 2018 — which is a big signal for the uptrend to continue.  However, the all-time high in the BTC pair is still 380% away. Such a run would, of course, push its value in USD even higher. Altcoins have been showing massive strength in their USD pairs, as many of them are creating new all-time highs. However, the BTC pairs of these altcoins still have a lot of upside potential.  This means that the market may just be starting the new bull cycle. In Cardano's case, the BTC pair is approaching a significant resistance zone, where a breakout doesn’t seem likely. However, once ADA price breaks through this resistance zone, continuation is expected toward 0.00003500 sats.  Bitcoin dominance bottoming out Bitcoin Dominance 3-day chart.

The Bitcoin dominance chart can frequently tell you when those corrections are going to occur. Historically, the best period to buy altcoins is in December. This was confirmed again recently as altcoins started to see massive gains in the new year. However, the chart also shows that Bitcoin dominance relief rallies can occur before more downside. This often happens in February and March, during which a healthy correction could be expected.

However, several points of interest can be found based on the daily timeframe using the Fibonacci indicator and historical price action. The first point is found around the $0.65-0.70 area, confluent with the 0.35-0.382 Fibonacci level. The next support zones are at $0.55 and $0.42-0.46 if that level doesn't hold.

In terms of the number of enthusiasts involved, the adoption is surging 10 percent weekly. Thus, starting from Fund4, voting for the most valuable projects will be fully integrated with the Daedalus wallet. The minimum amount of ADA for a voter is set at 3,000 ADA to prevent the system from being bogged down with spam messages. Also, the net sum of funding has increased to $1,000,000 in Cardano (ADA) tokens. Twenty percent of Project Catalyst treasury funds will be distributed among community advisers, referrers and participating voters for their contribution. Launched without fanfare in Q3, 2020, Project Catalyst coordinates and supports the development of decentralized applications for the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. As covered by U.Today yesterday, Input Output HK announced on Feb. 12, 2021, that the first three stages (funds) of Cardano's (ADA) Project Catalyst allowed it to evolve into the world's largest decentralized autonomous organization. Meanwhile, developers released the new version of the ADA wallet, Daedalus Flight. It supports all of the specifications introduced by the recent Mary hardfork. This hardfork is intended to pave the way to Goguen's post-Shelley era with smart contracts and dApps.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-announces-1000000-funding-for-project-catalyst-new-stage-upgrades-daedalus-wallet,utoday,2021-02-13,14:18:00,en
cardano, Analysis , Cardano approaches a new major upgrade as ADA posts an inspired rally ,"The Cardano Foundation's coin  ADA , hit its all-time high of $0.97 on Feb. 12, having started the year trading at $0.18, thus entailing 438% gains year to date. Apart from the macro trends in the cryptocurrency industry driving up the price of flagship assets, such as Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) translating to other altcoins, such as LINK, DOT, etc., Cardano’s growth could also be attributed to the network updates that Cardano has been running on its blockchain network. On Feb. 3, Cardano’s development firm Input Output Hong Kong successfully conducted a hard fork and also applied the Goguen native token upgrade, known as the Mary upgrade, to Cardano’s testnet, which transforms the blockchain into a multi-asset network similar to Ethereum.  The team expects to have launched the mainnet by the end of February. The other features of the Goguen update will roll out simultaneously in accordance with the different phases of the  Cardano roadmap . In terms of functionality, this upgrade would equate Cardano’s native tokens to ERC-20 fungible and ERC-721 nonfungible tokens on Ethereum. For the first time, users on the Cardano blockchain will be able to create their own tokens, be it fungible tokens or NFTs. In addition to these similarities with the Ethereum blockchain, there are design differences between Cardano’s native tokens when compared to Ethereum tokens. Cardano’s token design difference is a USP? The first major difference following the upgrade is that there will be “no execution fees,” which are usually charged to a user when interacting with a token smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain, known as gas fees.  The recent bull runs witnessed in Ether and other Ethereum blockchain tokens have led to extremely high gas fees due to network congestion, thus  discouraging retail investors  from getting involved. Hinrich Pfeifer, general secretary of the Cardano Foundation, discussed with Cointelegraph how Cardano’s native tokens would differ in this aspect: “Native tokens on Cardano are ‘forged’ on-chain with no need for a smart contract, and therefore, no execution fee is required to transact native tokens on Cardano.” He added further: “Instead, sending tokens requires a nominal fee (called the ‘min-ada-value’), payable in ADA, to be sent alongside the tokens. You may also bundle multiple native tokens together and send them together in one transaction (this raises the ‘min-ADA-value’). However, this fee does not depend on network congestion, or rely on smart contract execution.” Not needing smart contracts to forge tokens would lead to other advantages because there would be no room for fraud perpetrators to exploit smart contract vulnerabilities, human error and other risks associated with smart contracts — something which Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin  warned  the community against last year.  Pfeifer further elaborated on how “the opportunity to siphon funds through a smart contract exploit is eliminated” on the Cardano blockchain: “User-defined native tokens on Cardano use the same underlying token logic as the Cardano blockchain itself. Cardano’s scripting language does not have fixed-size integers, and the ledger itself tracks token movements and handles the token logic.” James Beck, director of communications and content at ConsenSys — a blockchain technology company backing Ethereum’s infrastructure — told Cointelegraph of how Ethereum  addresses  these smart contract risks: “Ethereum has been supporting smart contracts since 2015, yet smart contract development is still a maturing field. With Ethereum, every week, bugs and security risks are discovered and added to registries of smart contract security best practices.” ADA fighting for No. 4 spot by market cap ADA has recently hit its three-year high and  leap-frogged  Polkadot’s DOT and  XRP  to briefly become the fourth-largest cryptocurrency currently in circulation. Unlike meme coins, such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ), which have recently been gaining a heap of mainstream attention from the media and even personalities like Elon Musk, Cardano’s growth may be attributed to its sound fundamentals and working principles that it possesses.  Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of Gate.io — a digital asset trading platform — told Cointelegraph that the team led by Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, “have taken a ‘research-first’ approach to solving the various issues plaguing the modern blockchain ecosystem: lack of speed, high fees, etc.” She added that “for example, Cardano’s Ouroboros algorithm was the first peer-researched consensus algo in the world. [...] Their emphasis on doing the work before launching the product has helped them immensely.” Since institutional investors are a major catalyst to such markets, Cardano intends to gain more traction with them as compared to other blockchain protocols. Pfeifer stated to Cointelegraph: “We expect Cardano’s value proposition, especially the degree of security and affordability that is guaranteed through our native tokens and focus on formal methods, will prove popular among institutions and enterprises. Other blockchain protocols have struggled with highly-publicised security issues and huge losses of value via smart contract exploits. In turn, this has prompted institutions to take a great deal of caution when exploring blockchain-based solutions.” In addition, the fact that Cardano has been implemented in Haskell, a functional programming language that is known for its high-liability applications, could open up different business use cases involving large enterprises and even governments. Pfeifer further stated: “Cardano may stand to capture an altogether different share of the market than Ethereum — that of national-level identity solutions, back-end financial infrastructure and powerful enterprise use cases.” Ethereum is still king  Although the “Ethereum killer” concept has been around since Ethereum has gained monopoly in blockchain use case scenarios, there haven’t been any networks that have been able to generate users and developers as Ethereum currently boasts of. Several networks have been trying to live up to this tag for sometime now and haven’t quite  gained the developer interest as expected . One important aspect to look at while considering the competition for Ethereum would be the scalability issues that Ethereum 2.0 proposes to solve with its move to a proof-of-stake protocol. Cardano’s scalability is expected to arrive through  Hydra , which would have multiple heads offering high transaction throughputs, which is measured in transactions per second. Each “Hydra” head can potentially process up to 1,000 TPS.  Pfeifer said that TPS can’t be the only measure of scalability due to Cardano’s Hydra heads structure since different types of transactions can take place on the blockchain, adding: “In the future, each Cardano node (facilitated by our stake pool operators) could run a Hydra head. Therefore, the TPS of the Cardano network could scale accordingly with the number of stake pools running a Hydra head.” Currently, there are over 1,400 independent stake pools operating on the Cardano blockchain. That being said, Ethereum currently has the largest developer pool, which is building widely used applications and interfaces, such as MetaMask, Compound and Protocol, including the core Ethereum protocol itself. Beck pointed out how Ethereum’s pool stacks up against Cardano: “Ethereum is still the most actively developed blockchain protocol, with 42,457 commits to its code from an average of 220 monthly active core developers. Cardano is not that far behind, with 37,327 commits, but IOHK is also involved in Ethereum Classic, which may inflate the data the protocol is attributed to.” This high developer activity is critical for the growth of any blockchain and its network effects. It’s also important to  create  smart contract standards and best practices as Ethereum attempted to do. Additionally, the scaling issue is currently being addressed by layer-two networks, such as Optimist Rollups and ZK-Rollups, and as Beck further stated, they decrease “fees and congestion by increasing the throughput of the blockchain to more than 1,000–2,000 TPS.” The rollup chain can also be thought of as an independent data shard that allows experimentation through various data and execution models that still settle on Ethereum. These rollups are a part of the Eth2 roadmap and intend to make Ethereum more scalable in the near term. Metcalfe’s law states that the value of a particular network is directly proportional to the number of users in the network. This could perhaps be the most important metric to value a network, as it alludes to the activity happening on the network being gauged. Here is where Ethereum completely dwarfs Cardano, with daily active addresses standing at over  760,000  in comparison to around  71,000  active users on Cardano. Regardless of their application and perceived rivalries, at this point, it’s evident that Ethereum is still far ahead of Cardano in the blockchain race considering the users and numbers of DeFi applications based on their respective blockchains.  It is likely that Cardano can successfully catch up to Ethereum over time with its strong fundamentals, which might lead to some DeFi applications migrating from Ethereum to Cardano, as done by  DNATags  recently. Pfeifer, however, approaches the breaking of the hegemony with a positive outlook: “It is very likely that more than one blockchain protocol will successfully co-exist in the space in the future. Every Cardano entity focuses on interoperability for the good of the entire blockchain industry, rather than direct competition and comparison. We are open to working with other blockchains.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-approaches-a-new-major-upgrade-as-ada-posts-an-inspired-rally,cointelegraph,2021-02-14,00:00:00,en
cardano,Markets,"Kiss' Gene Simmons Buys $300,000 Worth of  Cardano","Rock star Gene Simmons has voiced his support for cardano (ADA) on Twitter after tweeting that he has purchased $300,000 of the cryptocurrency. The Kiss bassist and frontman has stated that he believes in cardano thanks to its affordability compared with other cryptocurrencies, and has  bought  $300,000 worth of it.  Cardano's native token  ADA  is currently priced at $0.92 and is the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization at almost $29 billion. Cardano is a blockchain that aims to address the scaling problems of Bitcoin, while also creating a platform for smart contracts that is interoperable with the mainstream financial system. ADA has risen more than 400% year to date. Simmons later praised Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson's goal of helping develop emerging economies in Africa. The Kiss co-founder also stressed to his followers the importance of doing their own research before investing and pushed back at those who accused him of being compensated for his crypto endorsements. Simmons has previously  revealed  that he has holdings in  bitcoin ,  ethereum ,  litecoin  and other virtual currencies and also has  declared  himself the ""God of Dogecoin.""

cardano, Analysis , The staking race: Late entrant Ethereum lags behind rivals with Eth2 ,"The  Proof-of-Stake  model has been around since 2012, when it emerged as an alternative way to achieve consensus than Bitcoin’s computationally heavy  Proof-of-Work . However, it’s taken until now for PoS to take off, spurred by the launch of staking on high-profile platforms including Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, and Cardano.  Despite  epic price rises  since the start of the year and the fact that it’s the second-biggest cryptocurrency by total market capitalization, Eth2  lags behind competitors  in the staking rankings. So, why isn’t Ether ( ETH ) the number one staking cryptocurrency?  A brief history of proof-of-stake Back in 2012, Peercoin developers Sunny King and Scott Nadal proposed a PoS proposal as part of a hybrid consensus model. In 2013, the Nxt genesis block hailed the first pure proof-of-stake blockchain, which Blackcoin rapidly followed in early 2014. At that time, crypto was still relatively niche, and consensus models, in general, were still not necessarily the contentious issue they would become in subsequent years.  After Ethereum launched in 2015 and development activity rapidly gained momentum, many projects wanted to emulate its success. However, Ethereum’s scalability challenges — resulting from its dependence on proof-of-work — quickly became a known issue. Therefore, core development teams started examining other consensus models, attempting to put their own spin on their predecessors’ work. Delegated proof-of-stake emerged as one variation on proof-of-stake, pioneered by Dan Larimer.  EOS , Tron ( TRX ), Lisk and others continue to use DPoS to this day. However, the model has come under widespread criticism for introducing too much centralization of control into blockchains. Tezos ( XTZ ), which launched on mainnet in September 2018, devised a PoS consensus model involving delegation that overcomes some of the most critical challenges of the EOS-style DPoS consensus. Dubbed “liquid proof-of-stake,” the model allows XTZ holders to delegate their validation rights to other token holders. Validating nodes, or bakers, on the Tezos network, can use delegated funds as a contribution toward the minimum 10,000 XTZ required to become a baker. Liquid proof-of-stake varies from the EOS-style DPoS in that there is no fixed upper limit on the number of validating nodes that can participate in the network. Neither is delegation a requirement for someone to become a baker on Tezos, whereas in the EOS model, someone can only become a block producer based on delegation.  2020 — Staking takes off Tezos can take the credit for being among the first platforms to popularize staking, even achieving institutional buy-in to staking thanks to a  collaboration with Bitcoin Suisse . However, in 2020, several key developments in PoS blockchains saw staking take off, providing new income opportunities for crypto users. In May, Polkadot launched on mainnet after spending several years in development. Only weeks later, Cardano launched the Shelley iteration of its mainnet, allowing stakers to participate for the first time, albeit with no other functionality yet live.  It’s worth pointing out that each of these platforms has its own purpose and goals. Ethereum stands true to its original vision of becoming a “world computer,” whereas Polkadot was developed with interoperability and economic scalability in mind. Cardano prides itself on its peer-reviewed research foundations. However, what they have in common is that they’re all PoS platforms and all launched staking features in 2020. Currently, they also all make up the  top staking  platforms, with Ethereum trailing in fifth place, having similar staked value to Algorand. Avalanche comes in third place right before Algorand but presents a bigger staked value that’s closer to Cardano’s and Polkadot’s rather than Algorand and Ethereum. Arthur Breitman, one of the early architects of Tezos and a proof-of-stake advocate, told Cointelegraph that although PoS is taking time to be adopted, in his opinion, it has completely overshadowed PoW with the benefits it brings: “Proof-of-stake has gone from a fringe idea in cryptocurrency circles, to completely mainstream with the launch of Tezos in 2018, and with large institutions like Coinbase participating in staking. In the meantime, consensus attacks on smaller proof-of-work chains and the high amount of inflation associated with new proof-of-work chains have made it clear that proof-of-work is no longer viable for launching cryptocurrencies.” Why aren’t stakers rushing to Ethereum?  The most significant reason why stakers are more reluctant to stake on Ethereum is that the entry barriers are high with no prospects of a quick exit strategy in the event of any sudden price movements.  Eth2 stakers must lock away 32 ETH to become a validator, which, at the current ETH price, is worth over $60,000. Anyone who participates is in it for the long haul, as it’s not possible to unstake or transfer funds before the next phases of Eth2 go live, for which there is no defined date. Anyone who doesn’t have 32 ETH to stake could join a pool,  but this can be risky , and pool participants also have to pay fees.  There could be other factors at play preventing Ethereum from being the favored staking platform. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s launch of institutional ETH derivatives is currently  causing a significant stir in the ETH market , which could remove volume from staking.  Furthermore, other platforms have a longevity advantage over Eth2, which has only been in operation for a little over two months. By comparison, Polkadot and Cardano have had six months to lure in the stakers to join the network.  What about the competition?  Cardano may lead the pack in terms of staked value, but given that the project doesn’t yet have a fully operational mainnet and is working on a long-range roadmap to full functionality, stakers are taking their chances on a speculative future price for  ADA  that’s been performing very well so far, with substantial gains in 2021.  Related:  Cardano approaches a new major upgrade as ADA posts an inspired rally When asked about projects building on Cardano, Bakyt Azimkanov, director of global PR and communications at the Cardano Foundation, told Cointelegraph that currently, multiple  projects  are building or planning to do so on Cardano, adding: “The first commercial application of Cardano, for supply chain tracking, was facilitated by the Cardano Foundation. This project, a joint venture with supply chain tracking technology provider Scantrust, uses the Cardano blockchain to verify the authenticity of single-origin organic wine from a family-owned vineyard in Georgia.“ It seems as if most projects building on Cardano are still in the funding stages rather than active development, so why is Cardano proving to be such an attractive platform for stakers? Azimkanov attributes this to several factors, telling Cointelegraph that staking on Cardano is easy:  “Users simply have to deposit ADA into a wallet that supports delegation and choose a stake pool to delegate to. The process is then hands-off until the user wishes to withdraw or change pools. Users retain their staked ADA in their wallets at all time, so it’s an incredibly safe way to generate delegation rewards without heavy user interaction or risking loss of funds.” Development as a stimulus for staking? Based on a holistic assessment of the five PoS platforms occupying the top spots, Polkadot currently offers the highest rewards to stakers — over 13% compared with around 4% on Cardano, 7% on Algorand and 10% on Avalanche.  But how is Polkadot managing to outpace the competition in terms of staking rewards? Peter Mauric, head of public affairs at Parity Technologies — a blockchain infrastructure firm behind Polkadot — told Cointelegraph:  “Staking rewards in Polkadot are a byproduct of network participants’ willingness to lock their tokens into the staking system. High rewards are an indication that the staking rate is close to optimal. Because validators on the relay chain are going to be securing individual layer-one parachains, the assumptions made in the token economics are quite different from simplistic models where there is a singular smart contract platform state to manage.” In terms of development progress, Polkadot is ahead of its staking competitors. According to  PolkaProject , which tracks development activity on Polkadot, there are currently over 350 projects actively building on the platform, which is a positive signal for maintaining ongoing value.  Of the staking platforms leading the pack, including smaller projects, such as Avalanche, Algorand and Cosmos, only Polkadot, Cardano and Ethereum can claim to have a substantial amount of development activity. Mauric believes that the levels of activity on Polkadot, along with the promise of interoperability, also contribute to its popularity as a staking platform, stating that projects developing a wide range of smart contract parachains “will seamlessly interoperate both within Polkadot and over bridges to external networks that are preparing to launch.” A golden age for staking? It may still be the early days in the staking wars, but the current “big five” look fairly settled at the top of the tables as things stand. However, there’s still every chance some further jostling may take place among the staking leaders for the top 10 spots over the coming weeks and months.

Trading of  cardano  ( ADA )  suffered a similar fate on Kraken, with the ADA/USD pair slumping to $0.156 at 14:23 UTC from $0.842 three minutes prior. During the same hour, the lowest price of cardano recorded on CoinDesk 20 was at $0.835. ADA/USD pair on Kraken “We saw the price of some digital assets such as ether and ADA have a sharp downward movement this morning on multiple trading venues just after 14:00 UTC,” a spokesperson from Kraken told CoinDesk in response to the abnormally low prices of ether and ADA on the exchange. “Kraken also saw a surge in sell orders around this time.” “We’re communicating directly with clients and ask that anyone with questions about their account please open a ticket,” the spokesperson said, declining to comment further on the issue.

cardano,No Section,"IOHK Introduces New Programming Language, Glow. What Does It Mean for Cardano?","Within the framework of a recently announced partnership, Cardano (ADA), an Ethereum-compatible devnet, receives one more programming language, Glow. It advances the developers' experience of Cardano (ADA) and makes it even more attractive for Solidity-focused blockchain engineers. According to IOHK's press release shared with U.Today, a new programming language, Glow, is added to Cardano's Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) development network. This domain-specific language is designed to ease smart contracts writing and deployment. The introduction of Glow will improve the development process and reduce its costs. The new developers will be able to migrate to Cardano (ADA) from other chains. Since this language is ""portable,"" it will be applied to other blockchains besides Ethereum (ETH) and Cardano (ADA). As such, this release stresses IOHK's focus on cross-chain interoperability. Aparna Jue, Product Director at IOHK, highly praises this novelty in terms of future cross-network bridges and multi-blockchain use cases: We believe that mainstream blockchain adoption will be driven by the industry providing broad compatibility, breaking down barriers between individual blockchains and their native programming languages, allowing a broad range of developers to onboard. First, the addition of the Glow language to Cardano's development stack significantly advances the experience of smart contracts building. Smart contracts on Cardano (ADA) are the most inspiring milestone for IOHK in 2021. As covered by U.Today previously, Mary hardfork, which brings multi-asset support, will be activated on March 1, 2021. Then, IOHK outlines the simplicity of the Glow language for all developers. For instance, it allows a 20-line application to perform similarly to a 100-line application written in other mainstream blockchain-focused languages. Finally, once Cardano (ADA) becomes a programmatic chain, its developers will be able to choose between three languages to work on their decentralized applications, including decentralized financial protocols (DeFis). Glow will accompany Cardano's Plutus and Marlowe languages in its technology stack.",https://u.today/iohk-introduces-new-programming-language-glow-what-does-it-mean-for-cardano,utoday,2021-02-26,12:44:00,en

Now, Cardano (ADA) is a multi-chain network. Moreover, it can host assets from other blockchains with no need to deploy smart contracts. According to a press release shared with U.Today, Input Output HK has implemented revolutionary functionality on Cardano (ADA) blockchain. Now Cardano (ADA) can host assets from other blockchains (""non-native"") without smart contract deployment. It significantly reduces the costs of the development process and advances the interaction between programmatic and non-programmatic blockchains. Assets representing the native tokens of other chains work similarly to Cardano's ADA coins. Also, the first major players in the blockchain market shared their plans to build on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain with post-Mary operational functionality. Namely, blockchain-based lending platform Celsius Network and SingularityNET — the world's first decentralized AI network — will be the pioneers of Cardano's b2b adoption. Aparna Jue, Product Director at Input Output HK, stresses that it is in the very first steps of Cardano's adoption in terms of blockchain-based applications: Native Tokens are a crucial step in the rollout of smart contracts on Cardano, allowing businesses and developers to benefit from the increased security, flexibility and lower costs that a multi-asset enabled Cardano offers. Over the next few months, we expect to see a range of promising use cases for the utility of Cardano come to life. Additionally, Cardano's (ADA) decentralization metrics have also increased. At press time, 88 percent of the Cardano (ADA) blockchain is controlled by community-driven staking pools. The team at Input Output HK assures everyone that the project is on track to achieve decentralization.

The cryptocurrency that underpins the red-hot smart contract platform has rallied over 117 percent in less than two weeks in the run-up to the major upgrade that enables the creation of native tokens on the blockchain. 
 
Ethereum formalized the now-ubiquitous ERC-20 standard in September 2017 after it was initially introduced in 2015.  
 
With Cardano, the main difference is that its assets will be supported natively, meaning that there’s no need for writing smart contracts for their creation. 
 IOHK CEO Charles Hoskison is convinced that the new upgrade makes Cardano the best fit for launching DeFi tokens, stablecoins, and security tokens:        It’s an amazing technological marvel. It’s a great achievement. It’s a foundation to build upon.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Approaching Full Decentralization While ADA Price Retraces 29% from ATH,"By the end of this month, all Cardano (ADA) transactions will be validated by community-driven staking pools. Thus, genesis nodes will no longer take part in blockchain processes. Why is this milestone called D=0 Day? The d-parameter of Cardano (ADA) ecosystem displays the percentage of transactions validated by genesis nodes. Since the inception of Shelley in July 2020, the d-parameter was reduced by 0.02 (two percent) in every Cardano (ADA) epoch. Thus, on March 31, 2021, at the boundary of epoch 257, the d-parameter will fall to zero. All transactions will be validated by staking pools. The IOHK team decided to call this event D=0 Day. At press time, more than 1,800 staking pools are contributing to Cardano (ADA) transaction validation. To ensure the progress of decentralization, IOHK implemented a complex of measures to prevent the big pools from domination. As covered by U.Today previously, IOHK periodically adjusts its k-parameter (another decentralization metric) to support small-sized staking entities. According to IOHK's quantitative strategist, Colin L. Edwards, the latest adjustment of the k-parameter from k=150 to k=500  allowed  small and medium pools to surpass the top 10 staking whales by percentage of stake operated for the first time in Cardano's (ADA) history.

On-chain data shows competitor networks are still behind ,"Ether ( ETH ) remains the second-largest cryptocurrency and it absolutely dominates the smart contract industry according to an array of network usage metrics. Even though the network has been overwhelmed by peak activity which is causing median fees to surpass $10, the network effect of its large user and developer base seems to be enough to sustain its position as the second ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization. Nevertheless, some key on-chain metrics are beginning to show a potential change in Etheruem’s supremacy, which raises the age old question of whether an ""Ethereum killer"" will be able to dethrone the top network? Smart contracts Total Value Locked (TVL) ranking. Source: defillama.com As shown above, the Ethereum network vastly dominates decentralized applications (dApps). Due to its high gas fees for transactions, when analyzing the number of active addresses, the Ethereum newtork appears to be at a disadvantage to its competitors.  Over the past week, FLOW blockchain's NBA Top Shot had almost 80,000 active addresses which is five times larger than Ethereum's Rarible NFT marketplace or even SushiSwap. Thus, the first data to analyze is the daily active addresses number across each blockchain. Daily active addresses. Source: coinmetrics.io The chart above shows that Tron (TRX) has recently surpassed Ethereum in daily active addresses, although this metric can be easily inflated. The Tron network has virtually zero fees for simple transactions which creates an unfair comparison. By measuring effective transactions and transfers,it's easier to exclude the addresses that are not contributing to the network. Transactions and transfers, adjusted, USD. Source: coinmetrics.io By doing this we can see that Tron doesn't come even close to Ethereum's numbers, although Cardano's ( ADA ) recent price growth has led to a virtual tie between the two. Oddly enough, the Tron network holds over 14.5 billion of the Tether ( USDT ) in circulation, which by itself should boost network usage metrics. Meanwhile, Cardano has 90% fewer daily active addresses than Ethereum, yet, both networks handle the same amount of transfers and transactions. This is especially problematic as Ethereum handles 20 billion Tether tokens and also manages all the transactions of Chainlink ( LINK ), USD Coin ( USDC ), Wrapped ETH ( WETH ), and many others. ETH, ADA, NEM, NEO, TRX market cap, USD million. Source: cointrader.pro This data should, at least theoretically, be reflected in the market capitalization. Thus, it makes sense for Ethereum to dominate the ranking as no other network is even close to its decentralized applications.  Moreover, when analyzing the transfer and transactions' value, Ethereum leads by 50 times if we exclude Cardano's questionable figures discussed earlier. For the time being, the data suggest that the four “Ethereum killers” analyzed above are unlikely to “flippen” the Ethereum network anytime soon.

As Coin Metrics’s Nic Carter points out, it doesn’t have a single notable application: I am not aware of a single popular application deployed on Cardano, nor have I seen any enthusiasm for the platform among developers.  Not acting coy about his ambitions in the decentralized finance (DeFi) industry, Hoskinson believes that his blockchain is infinitely more efficient than the current leader:          You can take your DeFi and you can run it on my system for 1/100 to 1/1000 of the cost. The mathematician—who created Cardano after a tiff with Ethereum developers—has made some brash remarks about Uniswap, the largest DEX, and CryptoKitties, the poster child of dApps, comparing them to Beanie Babies: I don’t care about Uniswap and CryptoKitties and other things.

In April 2018, he indignantly tweeted that even scammers could get verified, but not him. 
 
Despite personally reaching out to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, he had  little success : The response is no. Apparently Twitter feels I do not deserve a verified account. As his follower count continued to grow, Twitter—whose verification process remains a mystery—would not budge.

IOHK is currently working with local governments to integrate Atala PRISM, a Cardano-based digital identity management solution, in Ethiopia, Nigeria, Kenya and other African countries. Hoskinson described the scope of the platform's functionality during his keynote address: For a large group of people, for the first time in their lives, they will have digital identity that also can be linked to wallets, that also can be linked to payment systems, that also can be linked to property, that can enjoy rich metadata and other such things. In the long run, IOHK aims to build an entirely new economy in Africa. 
 Cardano has had a strong presence in Africa for years. In May 2018, Cardano signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the Ethiopian government to use blockchain in the country's agricultural industry. 
 
In early February, IOHK's John O'Connor said that they were in the ""final stages"" of securing a major government contract on the continent: What I can say is that we are at the final stages of a large government contract that would have multimillion users being onboarded onto the platform for real-world blockchain implementation. Cardano's focus on Africa might raise eyebrows since this is not where the money is, but Hoskinson sees a slew of opportunities there. He compares African nations to China in the late 1980s: China was a very poor nation with many systemic problems, but amongst the very specialized actors who truly understood where things were going, they realized that changes in those systems had built up to a position where China, in just a few short decades, would become one of the richest and most powerful nations in the world.

""IOTA doesn't have fees."" Yeah, it does. They are just subsidized in a different way. Guys, there is network capacity, CPU, and data. It costs money. Nothing is free. While he explains that sending MIOTA might not incur any fees, they have to be paid for ""somewhere in the value chain."" 
 
He draws parallels between sending transactions and tweeting on social media platform Twitter: Twitter pays for it and makes it back with ads and selling my data. Their operating costs are in the billions of dollars. Yet, some questioned Hoskinson's take since all that matters is that MIOTA can be sent for free by the end-user. 
 
IOTA founder David Sonstebo—who parted ways with the IOTA Foundation in December—was among those who chimed in: Feeless does not mean incentive-less. IOTA Foundation's Hans Moog compared MIOTA transactions to emails  in his tweet :  Sending an email is not ""free"" - you need a computer and an internet connection but its feeless. IOTA works in the same way. You need a node, an internet connection and some funds to send around. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum and Cardano, IOTA is not a blockchain. It is actually powered by a distributed ledger called Tangle, which was designed to be scalable enough to be widely adopted for exchanging data between different IoT devices, such as electric cars. Last February, IOTA faced some bad publicity after the blockchain was essentially switched off after the hack of the Trinity wallet.

According to the presented roadmap, an Alonzo testnet could go live as early as next month. 
 
For the first time, developers will be able to deploy smart contracts on the testnet. 
 
In June, a code freeze will take place after months of testing that will kick off the clock on the hard fork launch.   
 
A slew of new applications could go live right after the rollout of the Alonzo mainnet that is slated to take place around August. Cardano developers have already presented an application written in the Plutus programming language that allows swapping tokens. It could potentially emerge as a competitor to Ethereum-based decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.    
 Cardano has already had two hard fork combinator (HFC) events over the past few months. The first protocol update was known as the Allegra hard fork, which allowed token locking in December. The second one was the Mary hard fork that brought native assets to the blockchain in March.

Starting from this date, ADA stakers will be responsible for all blocks on the Cardano (ADA) mainnet. The Cardano (ADA) blockchain is going through its last phase (""epoch"") in which federated nodes are assisting stake pool operators in block production. On March 31, the d-parameter will be reduced to zero. Cardano (ADA) inventor and CEO of Input Output HK, Charles Hoskinson, has taken to Twitter to yet again outline the importance of the upcoming transition. Two days ago, on March 25, 2021, Input Output HK successfully  submitted  a proposal to implement the update into Cardano's (ADA) codebase. As a result, at the boundary of epoch 257, the d-parameter will finally be reduced to zero. Since the launch of ADA staking, the hard-coded mechanism reduced it by two percent (0.02) per epoch. Thus, more and more computational power from the staking pool entered the network. Hand in hand with reducing the d-parameter, Cardano (ADA) is adjusting another decentralization metric, the k-parameter. It prevents large-scale pools from obtaining control over block production.

In the latest phase of Cardano's (ADA) progress, community-driven ADA staking pools will be responsible for 100 percent of block production. Thus, the process of keeping the blockchain integral and secure will be up to the community in its entirety. Prof. Russel explained that, starting from next week, the mechanism of randomness used as a basis of consensus will be slightly adjusted. New sources of entropy will be added: this event is a once-in-the-system's-lifetime transition. To ensure the advanced randomness of the new system, the Input Output team will inject transactions with metadata determined by several public sources of entropy: Hashes of the closing prices of the New York Stock Exchange on April 6, and real-time seismic data from the US Geological Survey, the University of Athens, and the Japan Meteorological Society. Seismic data will be gathered for the first 36 hours of the epoch. An entropy addition mechanism will be activated on April 5 during epoch 258.

As  reported by U.Today , Cardano's Shelley mainnet went live in July 2020, which allowed ADA holders to stake their tokens to earn interest. 
 
Mission-focused pools donate a percentage of their block rewards to numerous charitable causes. The largest one  has already collected  12.3 million ADA tokens ($14.6 million). 
 
In this way, delegators kill two birds with one stone: they earn personal rewards while donating money to charity. Over 10,000 Cardano users have already made such contributions. 
 
The list of ADA recipients is determined by stake pool operators, which helps bring more transparency to the table.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Achieves Historic Feat by Reaching Complete Decentralization,"History has been made.   At 21:44:51 UTC, Cardano, the fourth-largest blockchain by market cap, became fully decentralized, with block production now being completely controlled by the community.      
 
The global network of more than 2,000 stake pools is now in the driving seat. 
 
Aparna Jue, product director at IOHK, calls it “a key milestone” for the blockchain’s development: This is a key milestone in Cardano’s development, as it is the first component of the handover of control to the community. This is a process that will continue throughout the rest of this year. He adds that Cardano plans to add implement peer-to-peer network decentralization as well as advanced governance features in 2021.  Cardano’s switch to decentralization didn’t happen overnight. During the Byron era, it operated as a federated blockchain, meaning that IOG’s and EMURGO’s core nodes were producing all of the blocks.         
 
In July, Cardano rolled out the Shelley hard fork that brought the much-anticipated staking functionality. This also kicked off the decentralization clock.    
 
As  reported by U.Today , the first key decentralization milestone was achieved on Nov. 2 when the majority of public stake pool operators started producing the majority of blocks for the first time. It took the proof-of-stake blockchain almost five more months to finally achieve complete decentralization, with the d-parameter reaching a much-coveted zero.",https://u.today/cardano-achieves-historic-feat-by-reaching-complete-decentralization,utoday,2021-03-31,21:44:00,en
cardano, News , ‘Wild west’ as developers MacGyver highly popular NFTs on Cardano  ,"Despite not yet having functional smart contracts on the layer-one, intrepid Cardano developers have recently hacked together methods to mint bootleg nonfungible tokens. These experiments in hosting unique data on the blockchain are reminiscent of the pre ERC-721 standard era for Ethereum — and, what’s more, so far they’ve proven to be enormously popular with token drops routinely selling out.  In a  post  on Reddit today, ADA Technology Management (ATM), a staking pool operator for Cardano, revealed what they claimed to be two NFT images they’d minted on the chain. In the thread the company said they were planning to offer NFT minting as a service to pool delegators. The so-called NFTs come with a number of caveats, however. Because  Cardano doesn’t yet support smart contracts  or have a NFT token standard, in order to create a NFT users mint a native token one-of-one native token.  “Tokens on Cardano are native and are on the same level as ADA. Instead of smart contracts, so called ""minting policies"" control the flow of a certain token group. NFTs are basically tokens on Cardano with a quantity of 1,” explained Alessandro, the self-described “brains” behind SpaceBudz, a Cardano-native collectibles project and the author of a Cardano Improvement Proposal to establish a Cardano NFT metadata  standard . @spacebudzNFT  sales are starting to get a little bit crazy  Big shoutout to  @StaleDev  for making this bot!  pic.twitter.com/UW7iwCUL6J — NFT Room (@NFTRoom)  March 30, 2021 
 
 Developers can then embed in the token metadata a link to an Arweave and/or InterPlanetary File System address where an image is stored. One  example  NFT shows that the “metadata” section of a mint transaction includes a link to a IPFS address which displays the  associated  SpaceBud. The end result is a wholly unique token permanently recorded and transferrable on the Cardano blockchain — a NFT by many, if not all, definitions.  Thriving community Despite the extra hoops developers have to jump through to create them, the NFTs have proven to be enormously popular with users.  According to Alessandro, SpaceBudz sold out all 10,000 NFTs in just three days at a price of 50 ADA per, and there’s already an eager secondary market where especially rare SpaceBudz have sold for as high as $40,000.  Even before SpaceBudz, CardanoKidz was working on Cardano-native NFTs as early as August 2020. Multiple pre-sale rounds sold out “within hours of launch,” according to Zac, a member of the CardanoKidz marketing team. One Satoshi-inspired Kid sold for 32,000 ADA even before the tokens were minted, and the NFTs themselves went live in late March.

 Zac credits tools like a community-developed token and minting policy  tracker  for helping to make developers’ lives easier. The official Cardano developers, IOHK, appear to be embracing the new vertical as well, as lead engineer Polina Vinogravoda gave a quick tutorial on  minting  NFTs on the chain on Tuesday.  A host of other projects round out the upstart ecosystem, including CryptoPunk-inspired CardanoBits, and minting platform CNFT. While still rudimentary, the NFTs on Cardano are cheaper than those on Ethereum as well: minting a native token costs roughly 2 ADA, or $2.50. While the developers working in this nascent community have managed so far, ultimately they’re excited for smart contracts to make their lives easier. “We can’t wait for smart contracts to arrive for more functionality but we had JUST enough tools and experience to make NFTs work on Cardano,” said Zac. “It’s been an incredible journey so far.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/wild-west-as-developers-macgyver-highly-popular-nfts-on-cardano,cointelegraph,2021-04-02,00:00:00,en

cardano,Markets,"‘Coinbase Effect’ Means Average 91% Token Price Gain in 5 Days, Messari Says","In cryptocurrency markets they call it the ""Coinbase effect"" – the theory that up-and-coming digital tokens like cardano tend to experience a quick price pop after they're listed on the big U.S. exchange  Coinbase .  The phenomenon has been exhaustively researched and chronicled, and it happened recently after the digital-token cardano ( ADA ) listed on Coinbase. But now the cryptocurrency analysis firm Messari has conducted a fresh study looking at the price pops of tokens on Coinbase during their first five days of trading, compared with the impact of listings on other big digital-market venues including Binance, FTX, OKEx, Kraken and the Winklevosses' Gemini.  The conclusion? The Coinbase effect is quite real.  “Coinbase listings have the highest average return standing at 91%, but also have the widest distribution of ranging from -32% to 645%,” wrote Roberto Talamas, analyst at  Messari , a cryptocurrency research firm in newsletter post titled ""The Crypto Exchange Pump Phenomenon."" Recent Coinbase  listings  include cardano along with ankr (ANKR), curve DAO token (CRV) and storj (STORJ). Filecoin ( FIL ) is up sixfold since it appeared on the San Francisco-based exchange in  December .  Cardano, for its part, jumped 36% in two days on the rival Kraken exchange when Coinbase announced March 16 it planned to list the token, though some of those gains reversed on March 18 when trading actually started on Coinbase. (Messari's analysis looked at the token performance during the first five days following the listing, rather than from the date of the announcement.)   Messari then scrubbed the data to eliminate ""outlier"" data points – price reactions seen as so extreme that they might create an unrealistic picture of the effect. “Outliers experienced tremendous returns after their listing announcements, drastically skewing the average towards the right side of the distribution.” “Among these outliers,  District0x  (a platform to create decentralized marketplaces and communities) and  Civic  (an identity verification solution) saw their price increase 645% and 493% respectively,” wrote Talamas. Even after controlling for the outliers, Coinbase still had the highest post-listing price response compared with other big exchanges.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Devs Explain Why Alonzo Activation Is Crucial for Businesses,"Michael Peyton Jones, software engineering lead at Input Output HK, has published a detailed post on how Alonzo hard-fork activation will make Cardano (ADA) an advanced environment for blockchain-based business initiatives. According to the  explanation  by Mr. Jones, Cardano's (ADA) Alonzo hard-fork will expand the transformation processes initiated by the Mary and Allegra forks, the latest network upgrades for Cardano so far. The Alonzo update commemorates Alonzo Church (1903-1995), an American mathematician and logician who worked on the basics of theoretical computer science. Just like other Cardano forks, Alonzo will be activated without an actual chain split: Cardano (ADA) utilizes a hard-fork coordinator for seamless updates. Activation of smart contract functionality strictissimo sensu will follow in Q3, 2021: Alonzo will add support for smart contracts – digital agreements – to Cardano about four months from now.  This addition to the protocol will attract many businesses to Cardano (ADA) as its smart contract logic will allow it to leverage it for many use cases. In particular, Mr. Jones mentioned collectibles, crowdfunding and auctions as the forms to which Cardano's smart contract logics will be applied. Thus, Cardano (ADA) will break into the red-hot segment of NFTs. Then, Cardano (ADA) smart contracts will be suitable for building decentralized exchanges with trustless escrows, as well as for sophisticated decentralized financial protocols with centralized stablecoin support. Real-world businesses will be able to utilize Cardano (ADA) for their supply-chain tracking applications. Also, token minting with predetermined vesting periods will be offered to projects with native tokens.

cardano, Analysis , Life beyond Ethereum: What layer-one blockchains are bringing to DeFi ,"Issues with  Ethereum congestion and high fees  have led to many companies adopting layer-two solutions like Optimistic Rollups, OMG Network and many others. These platforms allow transactions to be created outside of the Ethereum network on what are known as “sidechains,” which then can be reconciled on the main Ethereum network in one simple transaction. These layer-two options are  gaining a lot of traction  in anticipation of the release of Ethereum 2.0, which aims to solve the current high gas fees through sharding and splitting transactions throughout multiple blockchains. Many projects have been  adopting both layer-one and layer-two solutions  to give users alternatives to the current demanding fees seen on the Ethereum blockchain. Among these projects, decentralized exchanges like SushiSwap and 1inch stand out. Sergej Kunz, co-founder of 1inch Network, told Cointelegraph: “We are ready to expand to any other blockchain with enough DEXes, tokens and users. No matter if it is a separate blockchain like BSC, NEAR, TRON, Solana or it is an L2 solution like Optimism or zkSync.” Binance Smart Chain: Complimenting while competing In the meantime, layer-one projects like Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, give users cheaper and faster trading and liquidity provision options. BSC is one of the most popular alternatives to Ethereum, due to all of the advancements already made by Binance. Zhenwu Shi, founder of InfStones — one of the top 10 validators on the BSC network — told Cointelegraph: “Making a transaction on BSC only takes $0.1 and is confirmed within 5 seconds, while it takes $20 and a few minutes on Ethereum. Such excellent performance has attracted a lot of developers to migrate their projects to BSC. Moreover, Binance is dedicating a significant amount of engineering resources on developing BSC, and the technology progress of BSC is much faster than other projects.” While BSC can be seen as Ethereum’s current number-one competitor, there are other ways of looking at the present scenario. BSC provides an alternative for projects and users that frees up space on the Ethereum chain and allows for cheaper gas prices on this currently overburdened blockchain. Some, however,  have slammed BSC for being centralized , so there are many factors to consider when thinking about efficiency and decentralization. Many believe that the future of blockchain and smart contract platforms will be distributed once there is no single project that will hold total domain over the market. Multiple projects will have different advantages and features to offer users. Sometimes, even branding can make projects stand out from each other. As so, it’s unlikely that Ethereum will remain the dominant decentralized finance powerhouse it has been so far. Ilya Abugov, an advisor to a DeFi data platform DappRadar, told Cointelegraph: “ETH 2.0 is significantly far away that competing blockchains can establish their own ecosystems. When ETH 2.0 launches, it will likely be just one of the options for project teams. It should improve things for the Ethereum ecosystem, but it will not take things back to Ethereum as the only viable option.” A community-driven project, Cardano Many other projects offer different approaches to smart contract and DeFi technology that may compete with and complement the current paradigm that has so far been dominated by Ethereum, which has achieved a strong network effect. Alongside BSC, Cardano is often viewed as one of the leading contenders to Ethereum. The Cardano community has a passion, and the community has seen rapid expansion. Love him or hate him,  Charles Hoskinson can move a crowd . Cardano was built from the ground up with the backing of academic research. Many in the blockchain industry consider Cardano to be one of the best-designed blockchains in the crypto space. The industry heavily criticized Cardano for its initial slow development. However, as the system becomes operational, the thought, planning and engineering may allow for rapid acceleration and adoption.  Cardano is one of the pioneers in an emerging contract  model , extended UTXO. Extended UTXO builds on the “box” transaction framework that was brought to market by Bitcoin. However, UTXO boxes gain custom logic and programmability. Rather than the contract model, which gained adoption starting with Ethereum, the extended UTXO has a unique property by which the majority of the contract logic does not run on the blockchain itself. The extended UTXO model prevents the chain bloat that account-model smart contracts accumulate.  The extended UTXO model is relatively new. However, many researchers believe it is equivalent to moving from 8 bit to 64 bit. Some had speculated that Cardano’s real challenge to compete with BSC and Ethereum might as well be the path to mass developer adoption of this new model, as it is relatively new. The Plutus testnet  certainly puts these fears to rest , as there have been overwhelming interest and signups before its launch.  The extended UTXO alliance in Ergo Ergo is a project that lacks the hype-driven marketing that tends to be so prevalent in the crypto space. Perhaps this is because its research-first approach and high-level content produce a lot of confusion for the average crypto investor. Ergo is a proof-of-work, or PoW, smart contract blockchain, and was the first blockchain to introduce the extended UTXO smart contract model. This led to a strategic research partnership with Emurgo and IOG, the two primary companies building Cardano.  Joint research has created oracle pools , a radical new approach to broadcasting read-only oracle data in the blockchain space.  NIPoPoW’s, or non-interactive proofs of proof-of-work, allow full PoW node security on ultra-light client environments, mainly cell phones. The founder and core developer of the Ergo platform, Alexander “Kushti” Chepurnoy, told Cointelegraph: “Ergo is acting in a Bitcoin-like UTXO model, which is far more friendly to known scalability and privacy solutions than Ethereum and other account based block chains. Ergo has native tokens, not contract based, which is cheaper. Also, it is enforcing developers to do computations off-chain, with just necessary checks and minimal storage to be on-chain, achieving rollups level of blockchain bloat compression.” The path to PoW full node security on mobile devices and potentially wearables is undoubtedly an exciting development. Joint research has also built the framework for an extended UTXO algorithmic stablecoin protocol, AgeUSD. The AgeUSD protocol can be customized to be a derivative representing any asset or commodity with relative ease.  While Ergo is not a native privacy coin, it already has one of the most advanced layer-two privacy applications on the blockchain: a noninteractive mixer. Ergo was launched with Schnorr signatures called sigma protocols.  The Ergo/Cardano  alliance  certainly is something that can drive further development. After completing the Goguen rollout, joint sidechain research may plug these two chains together, creating an extended UTXO network, bringing together the strengths of both PoW and proof-of-stake blockchains.  Array Waves is a blockchain protocol that seeks to create a larger ecosystem of interconnected blockchains. Solving this fragmentation and interconnection, the blockchains' cumulative functionality is one of Waves’ critical points of focus. Rather than squeeze everything into one chain, the solution lies in interchain interaction that is genuinely blockchain agnostic, without a new native token, but with its tokenomics based on participating chains’ respective economies. When asked about the advantages being brought to DeFi by Waves as a layer-one protocol, the head of growth at Waves, Max Pertsovskiy, told Cointelegraph that since the smart contract scripts are not Turing complete, it is easy to predict their complexity, and as such, “A blockchain transaction fee doesn't depend upon what script is used and is fixed at 0.005 WAVES, or $0.05 at the current exchange rate.” He added further: “Another factor is staking, which, thanks to the Waves protocol's underlying LPoS consensus algorithm, facilitates locking WAVES coins at 6% annually and, based on that, building attractive DeFi mechanics, as the Neutrino team has done.” The blockchain space is famous for its tribalism — one chain to rule them all. The Waves protocol is working to develop gateways that remove borders to interconnect the blockchains. Waves would allow each blockchain to potentially hyper-specialize while evolving together as a whole. However, it is debatable whether the different tribes will unite and form a society.  Is DeFi adoption here to stay? It is hard to say with any level of certainty what the future of DeFi will look like. The current DeFi environment has many notable projects all building toward a common goal. The race might be decided by technology, or perhaps community adoption, or maybe use will be the deciding factor.  It’s worth noting that, much like traditional finance, the world of DeFi may have room for many competing and collaborative solutions. For example, Polkadot believes this to be the case and focuses heavily on building interoperability solutions. One thing is clear: The increasing level of research, innovation and adoption certainly shows that the DeFi movement is only going to grow. Michael Gord, managing director at the XDB Foundation — a nonprofit organization focused on supporting DigitalBits and related technologies — told Cointelegraph: “Over the past year, the industry has more than proven its ability to hyperconnect all manners of network participants, and now, there are more places than ever to build. We are witnessing the rise of protocol layer blockchains, such as Polkadot, Cardano, Stellar and DigitalBits.”  Gord believes that the future of DeFi is not about one chain or the other but about a cross-chain one. Though difficult, “Cross-chain solutions are absolutely imperative to keeping DeFi truly open.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/life-beyond-ethereum-what-layer-one-blockchains-are-bringing-to-defi,cointelegraph,2021-04-14,00:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Introduces Registry for Native Tokens,"The Cardano Foundation has announced a registry for native tokens, which is a centrally-managed collection of on-chain identifiers. 
 
 The registry  is meant to provide all the necessary information that includes the name of a certain token, its ID as well as a list of its main functions: Essentially, the Cardano Registry gives users access to the true character of native tokens deployed on Cardano through human-readable metadata and other descriptive information. Eventually, this data will be available to view alongside native tokens through both the Daedalus and Yoroi wallets. It is not mandatory for developers to register their tokens. However, by doing so, they will make sure that the token is authentic, meaning that its name will not be replicated on the blockchain. 
 
Other advantages include the ability to verify tokens with the help of a Policy ID and viewing the most relevant metadata. 
 
 Native tokens arrived on the Cardano blockchain following the activation of the much-awaited Mary hard fork in early March. They are similar to ERC20 tokens that run on top of the Ethereum network. 
 
Overall, there are now more than 600 assets on the fifth-largest blockchain.

cardano, Analysis , Cardano’s upcoming Alonzo update pushes ADA price despite a major delay ,"Cardano ( ADA ) has risen to become one of the top 10 cryptocurrencies in the world by market capitalization in a short time span. It currently ranks seventh, with a market capitalization of over $41 billion. It accounts for nearly 2% of the entire cryptocurrency market. According to  data  from CoinGecko, Cardano hit an all-time high of $1.55 on April 14. The IOHK is led by Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and also the co-founder of the Ethereum blockchain. On April 6, through his YouTube channel, he  discussed  Cardano’s roadmap covering the next four years in a video titled “Some Musings about the Roadmap.”  In these musings, he mentioned that although the Cardano developers are working on solving the  scalability issue  and Cardano’s approach to it, he will only turn his attention toward this issue once the Alonzo update has been completed. The scalability phase of the Cardano roadmap is coming up next, following the completion of the Goguen update. This phase is named Basho, after the 17th-century Japanese haiku master. The Deadalus and Alonzo upgrade On April 1, Cardano  released  the Deadalus update, which ushered in support for native tokens on the Cardano blockchain, along with the Project Catalyst Fund3 voting registration, effectively beginning the countdown to Cardano becoming an entirely decentralized blockchain.  This countdown has since reached its fruition. Cointelegraph discussed more on the Deadalus update with a representative of the Cardano Foundation. They stated: “Daedalus users can now use their wallet as a single unified interface to receive both ADA, as well as a host of other native tokens deployed on the Cardano blockchain.” They further spoke on Cardano becoming a completely decentralized network, elaborating: “We are delighted to report that the D=0 countdown, which signaled the full decentralization of the Cardano blockchain, has also been included in the latest implementation of Daedalus. This marks a momentous milestone where all of Cardano’s stake pools are operated by community-led stake pool operators.” On its official website, Cardano claims that this decentralization event makes it one of the most decentralized blockchains in the world. The next and final phase of Goguen in Cardano’s roadmap is the previously  delayed  Alonzo update. The upgrade will bring smart contract functionality to the blockchain. The development of this upgrade is enabled by the Plutus platform, which brings a native smart contract language to users of the Cardano blockchain as mentioned in an IOHK  blog  about Plutus. Before the Deadalus update, Cardano went through its  Mary hard fork , which introduced tokens to the Cardano unspent transaction output set that allows custom tokens and nonfungible tokens to be processed by miners with the same cost efficiency as the native coin of the blockchain network, ADA.  Furthermore, Cardano developers have even found a way to  mint and sell NFT collectibles  without smart contract functionality. Cointelegraph discussed with Johannes Jensen, product and project manager of eToroX — a digital asset platform. He said: “The Alonzo hard fork introduces a more complex coordination problem, as the surrounding ecosystem of service providers will need to prepare for the hard fork and the subsequent Cardano-based tokens and smart contracts altogether.” ADA could reach $2 soon due to DeFi growth Cardano’s ADA has seen nearly 10% gains in the last 14 days. Considering that the significant $2 mark is $0.6 away from the current trading price, at the current rate of growth, it is highly unlikely that ADA will surpass the $2 mark in the near future.  However, another possible “DeFi summer” is one of the main reasons that could drive the growth. If we use the DeFi summer of 2020 as a gauge for this year, the DeFi markets will probably grow to new highs in 2021. In fact, the one-year gains for ADA currently stand at 3,490.8%. According to  data  from DappRadar, the total value locked in decentralized finance protocols reached its all-time high of $70.43 billion on April 16. Since the beginning of this year, the TVL has grown nearly four times, at the time of writing. The TVL went from $30.74 billion on Jan. 20 to currently standing at $64.47 billion as of April 19.  This period has marked immense growth for this sub-sector of the cryptocurrency market. On this, Jensen further opined: “There is little doubt that the final stages of the Goguen phase on Cardano will introduce a host of existing trends in DeFi onto the network, such as automated market makers and lending market.” However, most DeFi protocols currently in existence are built on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum has also onboarded the development teams of top DeFi protocols such as Uniswap, Yearn.finance and others. Although even Cardano remains to be positive about their scope in the DeFi markets, the representative from the foundation said: “We are sure that as more of our components become available, we will see a multitude of DeFi solutions and indeed all manner of DApps built and migrated to the Cardano blockchain.” Related:  Life beyond Ethereum: What layer-one blockchains are bringing to DeFi With its use cases and the incoming Alonzo update bringing smart contract functionality, Cardano is well-positioned to become a DeFi alternative platform to Ethereum. Adoption among decentralized applications and DeFi protocols will also impact the price of ADA.  In addition to expanding its footprint in the DeFi markets, Cardano is making efforts to improve blockchain adoption in markets such as South America,  Africa  and Southeast Asia. The platform intends to offer the blockchain’s capability to various different use cases such as logistics, procurement agriculture and trade. Cardano is working with Emurgo, an emerging market consultancy, to achieve this goal. Here, Jensen said:  “If they are successful in convincing leaders in Africa, South America and Southeast Asia to use the Cardano blockchain, the yardstick will switch from the Ethereum-based DeFi applications for global commerce and trade processing applications.” Cardano already has use cases in the supply chain domain. The Cardano-Scantrust solution lets businesses use various blockchain functions to  aid  multiple aspects of their business. Along with aiding business solutions, the Cardano blockchain is seeing adoption from new domains.  Recently, the first Cardano-based stablecoin was announced,  AgeUSD , which is an algorithmic stablecoin protocol that was developed on the Ergo blockchain in collaboration with Emurgo and Input-Output Global. This stablecoin will be available on Cardano along with the Alonzo smart contract update. With Ethereum’s rising gas fees, the “ Ethereum killer ” narrative has been in the cryptocurrency market almost since Ethereum gained the spotlight. There has been little development on this as Ethereum continues to be king of the DeFi ecosystem. However, Cardano takes a very positive approach to this entire narrative, with its representative stating: “We are less interested in competing for market share and more interested in delivering best-in-class components for the decentralized future. [...] We would rather focus on interoperability and cooperation with other blockchains, as we believe that decentralized technology is too important to fail. We work for the good of the entire blockchain industry and the adoption of blockchain technology as a whole.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-s-upcoming-alonzo-smart-contract-update-takes-ada-to-new-highs,cointelegraph,2021-04-19,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano and Polkadot extend staked capitalization dominance ,"The stakes have been upped for Cardano and Polkadot, with the two networks continuing to dominate the staked capitalization rankings. According to data from  StakingRewards , Cardano is currently the top blockchain in terms of staked value, with roughly $26.4 billion worth of Cardano ( ADA ) allocated to securing the network. With Cardano’s entire capitalization tagging $36.6 billion, 73% of circulating ADA are being staked. StakingRewards estimates Cardano stakers are earning an annual reward of 7.22%. The second-largest crypto asset by staked value is  Polkadot  with $22.7 billion worth of DOT locked — representing 64% of its circulating supply. Average annual staking rewards for DOT are estimated at more than 13%. Cardano and Polkadot currently represent 7.9% of the $620.6 billion in crypto assets currently designated for staking across the crypto asset sector combined. While Polkadot and Cardano have long dominated the staking sector by locked value, other leading assets have experienced notable disruptions to their rankings recently. Solana has now surpassed Eth2 to take the third spot for staked capitalization, with $9.4 billion in capital staked. SOL staking and validation require the asset to be time-locked and taken out of circulation, which may explain the discrepancy, explaining why its staked capitalization exceeds its roughly $8-billion market capitalization. SOL stakers are generating 11% annually. Top 10 staking assets by staked capitalization:  StakingRewards The once king of staking  Tezos  has dropped way down to the 11th spot, with a staked capitalization of $3.5 billion yielding 5.5% per annum. In mid-December 2020, Tezos was ranked fourth, according to a  Cointelegraph report at the time .  In terms of overall capitalization, Tezos ( XTZ ) has slumped from the top 10 to rank 35th according to CoinGecko. Ethereum 2.0 currently ranks as the fourth-largest staked asset with $8.2 billion. According to the  Eth2 launchpad , there are 3.9 million Ether ( ETH ) locked into the Beacon Chain deposit contract. However, just 3.4% of circulating Ether has been allocated to staking, suggesting there is still significant room for Eth2’s staking cap to grow. While ETH stakers are currently earning more than 7% annually, Ethereum’s forthcoming chain merge is expected to significantly boost rewards as stakers begin collecting fees from the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  Eth2 researcher Justin Drake predicts staking rewards will at least double with the chain merge, estimating rewards could jump to 25% per year. staking rewards likely to at least 2x with EVM gas fees I expect ~25% staking APR immediately after the merge more rewards → more staking → more economic security https://t.co/6YTnaGGNyA — Justin Ðrake  (@drakefjustin)  April 19, 2021

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson: Cardano Is 1.6 Million Times More Energy Efficient Than Bitcoin,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson has touted Cardano's green cred during a recent  Forbes interview , claiming that the blockchain is 1.6 million times more energy efficient than Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency. 
 
Hoskinson's comment was meant to put across what he views as the main advantage of proof of stake (PoS) over the power-guzzling proof of work (PoW): The advantage of proof of stake is that because you don’t have that gargantuan overhead and energy expenditure for deciding who gets to make a block, it means you can put a lot of your magic in the other two stages. Hoskinson, of course, is far from the only cryptocurrency luminary who is taking aim at Bitcoin's energy consumption. As  reported by U.Today , Ripple co-founder Chris Larsen went as far as suggesting that Bitcoin should follow Ethereum's lead by ditching proof of work (PoW) to remain the dominant currency — even though such a transition would be technically impossible. 
 
Comments about Bitcoin's CO2 footprint are quickly dismissed by the cryptocurrency's advocates. A study jointly conducted by Square and Ark Invest shows that the top crypto could actually accelerate the adoption of green energy, with profit mining making it affordable. 
 
 Hoskinson mentions that over 10,000 native tokens have been launched on Cardano since the rollout of the Mary hard fork in March. 
 
After introducing smart contracts with Alonzo this summer, the project will then focus on activating governance components that already have roughly 20,000 participants, according to the billionaire. 
 
The commercialization of Cardano will involve onboarding nation-states and bringing in millions of users, Hoskinson says: Once those things are turned on, commercialization of the platform is already underway. We're getting nation states to do cool things and we're bringing millions of users in through that push model.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-cardano-is-16-million-times-more-energy-efficient-than-bitcoin,utoday,2021-04-26,16:18:00,en

The Atala PRISM decentralized identity solution will be used for recording and monitoring the grades of five million local students across 3,500 schools. The main aim of the initiative is to reduce bogus university applications and make it possible to check the validity of students' grades without relying on the assistance of third parties. Bringing more transparency to the grading process could increase social mobility and improve employment opportunities for rural Ethiopians. As  reported by U.Today , several educational institutions have already adopted blockchain to battle counterfeit diplomas, but such efforts have been spotty. While commenting on the scale of Atala PRISM, IOHK's John O'Connor claims that Cardano is now ""mature enough"" to serve an entire nation: Ethiopia's blockchain-based education transformation is a key milestone on IOHK's mission to provide economic identities and employment, social and financial services for the digitally excluded. After five years of R&D, Cardano is now mature enough to underpin a blockchain solution which can scale to serve an entire national population. Starting with education, IOHK will continue working with the Ethiopian government to transform other sectors—from agriculture to healthcare—and ultimately help the poverty-stricken country to achieve the much-coveted lower-middle-income status by 2025. In March, IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson claimed that new Africa deals could bring  millions of users  to the Cardano blockchain while drawing parallels between African nations today and China in the 1980s. Back in 2018, IOHK and Ethiopia penned a deal to use Cardano in the local agriculture industry and train Ethiopian developers to use the blockchain.",https://u.today/cardano-developer-iohk-announces-worlds-biggest-blockchain-deployment-in-ethiopia,utoday,2021-04-27,14:14:00,en

Apart from crypto, it also offers exposure to various equities, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds and a slew of fiat currencies. CEO Dave Sparvell expects cryptocurrency traders to diversify their holdings with some of the traditional investment vehicles: We expect to see clients both actively trade the volatile cryptocurrency markets, as well as diversify their existing portfolios of international stocks, ETFs and investment funds into this emerging asset class. One of the main perks offered by Swissquote Bank Europe is deposit protection that, according to local laws, covers exchanges' balances as high as €100,000. 
 
Later in 2021, the Luxembourg banking entity will also introduce cryptocurrency-focused services that will be specifically designed for institutional investors. Swissquote, a major Swiss banking group, has been in crypto for quite a while. Back in November, it became Europe's first online bank to offer Bitcoin trading after partnering with cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp.

cardano, News , Your future at stake: Uni of Wyoming allocates $4M to staking three coins ,"The University of Wyoming is allocating $4 million to running nodes and staking at least three cryptocurrencies. The news was shared to Twitter on April 28 by Caitlin Long, a Wyoming Blockchain and Fintech Select Committee appointee and founder of  Avanti Bank & Trust  — a local bank servicing the digital asset sector. NEWS NOT REPORTED YET: State of  #Wyoming  appropriated $4m for nodes/staking in at least 3 cryptocurrencies, run by Univ of Wyoming.

 The  documentation  posted by Long notes the University appropriated $4 million from the state’s strategic investments and projects fund to establish, operate, and maintain “nodes and staking pools for no less than three publicly tradable cryptocurrencies."" The revenues generated by the University’s staking pools will first be mobilized to cover operational costs, and then to repay the $4 million to the state’s investment fund. Once the investment has been repaid, profits from the University’s staking will be distributed “to support blockchain programs and activities at the university and community colleges throughout the state.” The expenditure of profits generated through staking is conditional on the University matching every $1 appropriated from the investment fund with at least $2 in either private donations or from the campus’ reserve accounts. Chris Rothfuss, the senate minority leader of the Wyoming Legislature and Chairman of the state’s  Blockchain and Fintech Select Committee , praised the committee’s “herculean effort” in getting the legislation passed.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Developer IOHK Announces Major Partnership in Tanzania,"During today’s Africa-focused event, Cardano developer IOHK announced a major partnership with blockchain-powered World Mobile. 
 
As part of the deal, the two companies will build a new mobile network in Tanzania, a Sub-Saharan African country where a large percentage of the population doesn’t enjoy stable internet connectivity. The goal is to provide 100,000 people with access to 5G.      
 
While it’s unprofitable for ordinary mobile providers to expand to remote areas, World Mobile aims to make it possible with the help of the sharing economy system. Separate businesses will be able to run nodes to keep their region connected while reaping rewards in WMT tokens. IOHK will be working on implementing blockchain-powered IDs, leveraging its Atala PRISM decentralized identity solution. As  reported by U.Today , IOHK has managed to secure a deal with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education earlier this week. Roughly five million students will be able to take advantage of the blockchain-based ID system that will make it easy to record and monitor their grades. 
 
On top of that, SingularityNet, the artificial intelligence firm behind the human-like robot Sophia, will be cooperating with IOHK to establish a lab in Ethiopia that will focus on developing projects in such fields as artificial intelligence and robotics.           IOHK is marketing its partnerships in Africa as “RealFi” to highlight the real-world impact of Cardano as opposed to Ethereum’s dominance in the highly speculative decentralized finance (DeFi) space.           ",https://u.today/cardano-developer-iohk-announces-major-partnership-in-tanzania,utoday,2021-04-29,19:12:00,en
cardano, News , IOHK partners with Ethiopian government to revamp education system  ,"Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK, is helping the government of Ethiopia leverage blockchain technology to overhaul its education system.  The research and development arm behind Cardano is deploying its expertise to provide Ethiopian authorities with a new system for student and teacher identification, digital grade verification and the remote monitoring of school performance. IOHK’s Atala PRISM ID will  allow  authorities to create a tamper-proof record of educational performance for five million students across 3,500 schools. It will also enable the Ethiopian government to narrow down locations and causes of educational under-achievement. John O’Connor, the director of IOHK’s Africa Operations unit, called Ethiopia’s blockchain-based education system a “key milestone” for his organization. He explained: “After five years of R&D, Cardano is now mature enough to underpin a blockchain solution which can scale to serve an entire national population.” IOHK believes that the current blockchain-based transformation of Ethiopia’s education system could also be extended to post-secondary institutions, especially in the application of digital verification. Getahun Mekuria, Ethiopia’s education minister, commented on the initiative: “We believe blockchain offers a key opportunity to end digital exclusion and widen access to higher education and employment.” Africa has been one of IOHK’s primary development targets over the years. In 2019, the organization  embarked  on a new training initiative in Ethiopia and Uganda teaching women how to code in Haskell, the primary programming language behind Cardano. Beyond local initiatives, Africa is a central part of IOHK’s vision of bringing financial services to the world’s “unbanked population,” which is estimated at roughly 1.7 billion. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes Africa will play an important role in deploying blockchain infrastructure over the next five years.

cardano,Markets,Cardano in Africa: Inside IOHK's Ethiopia Blockchain Deal,"Ethiopia might be not the first place you think of as a hotspot for blockchain technology.  A predominantly rural country where only  15%  of the population has access to the internet, Ethiopia is going through  severe civil unrest  in the north. Ethnic strife in the Tigray region recently led to thousands killed and millions fleeing the country as refugees to neighboring Sudan. The country is also experiencing local  internet shutdowns . Ethiopia is thus a good example of the gap between the ambitious goals of modern technology and the actual circumstances on the ground.  IOHK, the company behind the  cardano  (ADA) cryptocurrency, believes it can help bridge this gap. This week, IOHK  announced  it has  partnered with the Ethiopian government  to create a blockchain-based system to track student performance in local schools. “It’s a hard country, so if we make it there we can make it anywhere,” said John O’Connor, IOHK’s director of African Operations.  ‘A dream come true’ Local challenges do not appear to be deterring IOHK from its mission. “Life has to go on for the rest of the country,” said O’Connor.  IOHK is establishing a physical presence in the country, opening an office in the capital, Addis Ababa, and starting work on the large-scale blockchain ID project, which is expected to go live in January 2022, O’Connor told CoinDesk. At the moment, the core identity product, named PRISM, is ready, and other features, including classroom management, will come later.  In a  video stream  IOHK made on April 29, Ethiopia’s Minister of Education, Getahun Mekuria, spoke of the partnership, saying the “initiative is about bringing technology to improve the quality of education” in Ethiopia. Cardano is one of the top cryptocurrencies, the minister said, which is why “doing blockchain with IOHK is like a dream coming true” for him.  According to the minister, 5 million students will receive Cardano blockchain-based IDs, which will allow the authorities to track every student’s academic performance. Also, 750,000 teachers will get access to the system. According to the minister, the Ethiopian government struck a deal with an undisclosed Chinese manufacturer to provide enough tablets for the project to happen.  O’Connor said the ministry, which enjoys financial support from large donors in the West including  USAID , will fund the purchase of the tablets, and also build lacking infrastructure so that 3,500 Ethiopian schools have access to the internet and can use the new system.  CoinDesk asked Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education to confirm these infrastructure plans but received no response by press time. It’s not clear how much the project will cost the government. On the ground O’Connor is half-Ethiopian and said he spent a few years in the country, hanging out with tech specialists. He was able to build a good rapport with Getahun Mekuria, who was the minister of science and technology before becoming the minister of education, O’Connor added. IOHK also got involved with Ethiopia’s local tech community. In 2019, the company organized  training  for female developers, teaching them to code in Haskel, Cardano’s programming language. After that, the IOHK Addis Ababa office hired seven of the 30 alums, O’Connor said.  He believes that with Ethiopia’s predominantly young population and the government’s enthusiasm about blockchain, major progress can be achieved no matter how tough the task may appear. At the moment, most information in Ethiopia is recorded on paper, not electronically, so the Ministry of Education has no actual data of the situation on the ground, O’Connor explained.  Now, IOHK wants to take this obsolete system and launch it into the Web 3.0 era. If the project succeeds, the results will be much more notable than they would be in many other places in the world, O’Connor believes.  “The marginal improvement in the U.K. wouldn’t be as great as in Ethiopia,” he said.   How it will work The system IOHK is building will mostly rely on the Ministry of Education running a full node, and schools will use a light client to get access. However, the system will be operating on the public Cardano blockchain and so will be decentralized in this sense, he said. To implement the project in thousands of schools across Ethiopia (though not in the Tigray region, where  civil unrest  continues), IOHK will work with a wide network of partners, O’Connor said, including mobile payment networks.  As a result, high school graduates will receive cards with near field communication (NFC) chips that will contain their educational credentials. This means the data will be available even if a child doesn’t have a mobile phone or other device to connect to the system, O’Connor said. This will resolve the issue of fake certifications, which is a serious problem in Ethiopia, he said. This might give young Ethiopians opportunities they don’t have now because their diplomas are not viewed as being reliable in the West, O’Connor said.  “I studied at Oxford and I was intrigued why there were no students from Ethiopia. When I asked about it I was told [the college] didn’t recognize their credentials. They don’t have enough information about what’s happening in Ethiopian universities,” O’Connor said.   When the project goes live, it will start with 12th grade students, Minister Getahun Mekuria said in the video stream with Cardano. But in the following years more students will receive blockchain IDs. According to O’Connor, the first million tablet computers for students are due to arrive in Ethiopia this month.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/04/30/cardano-in-africa-inside-iohks-ethiopia-blockchain-deal/,coindesk,2021-04-30,18:02:00,en

However, it has been mostly trading sideways over the past few months, trailing behind Ethereum, Binance Coin, and, of course, Dogecoin.       Cardano's renewed momentum could be attributed to IOHK's recent  partnerships in Africa  that earned it plenty of media coverage. The community is also anticipating the Alonzo hard fork, which will finally bring smart contracts to the sixth largest blockchain.               ",https://u.today/cardano-ada-scores-its-highest-daily-close-ever-after-major-partnerships-in-africa,utoday,2021-05-06,05:56:00,en

cardano, Analysis , Alt season rush: Ethereum and DeFi get in shape for another hot summer ,"Altcoins like Ether ( ETH ), Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) are spearheading a new alt season that seems to have taken off with a bang. Since a rising tide usually lifts all boats, there are several other cryptocurrencies that are benefiting from this growing interest in altcoins. Ether, however, may be the one generating the waves. The price of ETH, the flagship altcoin, increased more than 65% over 30 days to finally break through the $3,500 barrier on May 6. This takes the yearly gains for the token to over 1,500%, as it was trading in the $215 range this time last year. The price surge led its market capitalization to go beyond $400 billion for the first time. Cointelegraph asked  Joshua Frank , CEO of The TIE, about the social media trends around Ether and what the cryptocurrency’s gains mean for altcoins. He answered: “Many investors consider Ethereum a proxy for the alt-coin market, and tweet volume continues to increase exponentially since July 2020. [...] Tweet volume over 24 hours recorded an incredible 59,000 as Eth continues to push all-time highs.” In percentage terms, Ethereum Classic — a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain — has  seen its value increase even more  than the more popular coin of its sister blockchain. According to CoinGecko, ETC’s price  gained  nearly 400% in seven days to hit an all-time high of $167 on May 6. The Ethereum Classic blockchain sprang into existence after most developers migrated to the now more popular Ethereum blockchain following a hack on The DAO’s smart contracts in 2016, which cost the protocol $50 million in ETH. The dominance of Bitcoin ( BTC ) has also dropped when compared with the 70% range it was resting in at the start of the year. It has been declining since, reaching a year-to-date low of 45.70% on May 6. The dominance metric essentially compares the market cap of BTC with that of all other cryptocurrencies combined. BTC dominance usually decreases when altcoins instead dominate the interest of crypto investors. The only time  the metric has ever been lower  than its current level was just before the cryptocurrency market crash in 2018 when investors were desperately looking for alternatives to Bitcoin, as the flagship cryptocurrency had dropped by over 60% at the time. Eric Anziani, chief operating officer of cryptocurrency exchange Crypto.com, explained to Cointelegraph why he believes Bitcoin’s dominance is decreasing this time: “The price action acts in tandem with investors’ psychology, dominant narratives in the space, and therefore moves in cyclical patterns.” He added further: “As the narrative around institutional adoption of Bitcoin has tapered off somewhat, investors have begun to turn to blockchains and protocols other than Bitcoin. [...] Although Bitcoin is a very sound store-of-value, the market as a whole is realizing how pivotal altcoins and their respective projects are to the future of crypto.” This change in market dynamics is evident in the derivatives markets as well. On May 5,  Ether futures volumes briefly surpassed those of Bitcoin . The futures premiums for ETH have normalized at 25%, after peaking at 45% during mid-April.  This indicates that optimism is not nearly close to its peak despite ETH pushing to new highs on a daily basis, thus signaling that there is still room for growth when prices are compared with market sentiment. London hard fork will lead to faster DeFi growth Ether’s price surge essentially happened after the Ethereum blockchain underwent its Berlin upgrade on April 15. The hard fork  incorporated four Ethereum Improvement Proposals  that were voted on by the developer community. Two of these addressed gas costs for specific transaction types, and while they reduced the costs for some types of transactions, they increased them for “op-code transactions,” which could be used for denial-of-service attacks. The other two proposals expanded the categories of transaction logic. James Beck, director of communications and content at ConsenSys — a blockchain technology company backing Ethereum’s infrastructure — told Cointelegraph: “One of the nice effects of the Berlin hard fork was that gas prices for DEX aggregators became much cheaper. For example, using MetaMask’s swap feature is now resulting in 40,000 GWEI decrease to trade tokens.”  Ethereum is the most prominent blockchain used in the decentralized finance markets, and its price often goes hand in hand with DeFi’s growth. At the time of writing, the total value  locked  in DeFi is at a new high of just over $82 billion. The TVL in DeFi has been rapidly growing since the beginning of the year and has nearly doubled since the start of February. Flora Sun, managing director of Binance X — crypto exchange Binance’s developer initiative — opined on the reason for this growth: “There’s a lot of innovation in DeFi protocols these days. In the past, lending and DEX were the main DeFi protocols, but now starting with AMM, there are various types of DeFi that meet various needs, like vaults and insurances. DeFi still offers a much higher yield than traditional finance, so naturally, it is attracting a lot of crypto liquidity.” Automated market makers, or AMMs, are now integral to the DeFi ecosystem. As the name suggests, an AMM is an automated trading model that decentralized exchanges use instead of the order books used by traditional, centralized exchanges. When protocols use AMMs to supply liquidity pools, it means that the price of the assets is calculated by a fixed, predetermined mathematical formula based on the supply of the two tokens involved in the trade/swap. Related:  They see ETH rollin’: Why did Ether price reach $3.5K, and what’s next? According to ConsenSys’ quarter-one DeFi report, only 1% of all Ethereum addresses are currently  using  DeFi platforms. Thus, the room for adoption seems to be immense as more investors look to prioritize decentralization in their portfolios. The report also reveals that in the first quarter of 2021, nearly 51% of the total fees paid were on the Ethereum blockchain — more than double those of the Bitcoin blockchain. The decentralized exchange Uniswap by itself took nearly half the amount in fees taken by Bitcoin. Additionally, another improvement proposal for Ethereum, EIP-1559, has been greenlit by the developer community as a part of the London hard fork that’s scheduled to happen in July. Anziani further spoke on the hard fork: “This upgrade will begin burning transaction fees, naturally reducing Ethereum’s rate of inflation. If network usage is high enough, Ethereum may even become deflationary. This is a highly bullish development that the market has just begun to price in.” Additionally, Ether has shown a low level of global leverage across exchanges, which means that ETH holders are dealing more in spot holdings than indulging in the use of leverage to long Ether. Frank opined on what this might mean: “This indicates that holders intend to either hold Eth in their wallets and/or use Eth to interact in the eco-system with DeFi or other protocols rather than use leverage as a purely speculative play to profit.” Other alts grow as well Due to the growth of DeFi, alternative platforms to Ethereum, like Binance Smart Chain and Cardano, have been seeing increased adoption by DeFi protocols and decentralized applications as people seek to avoid Ethereum’s high gas fees, which have become an issue for users all around. Since the  gas-fee issue has persisted  for a while, BSC and Cardano have accommodated some of 2021’s DeFi growth. On the subject, Sun pointed out: “Since BSC launched in September 2020, in 8 months, there are 500+ projects building on BSC and its ATH daily transaction volume has exceeded Ethereum’s by 450% and currently boasts of $56 billion in its DeFi ecosystem. All the projects building on top of BSC contribute to this growth.” Binance Coin ( BNB ), the native cryptocurrency of both Binance Smart Chain and Binance Chain, has also quickly risen from trading in the $50 range on Feb. 1 to reaching an all-time high of $679.82 on May 3. That is a growth of over 1,200% in less than 100 days, leading BNB to rise to become the third-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization. According to CoinMarketCap, the token has a  market cap  of nearly $100 billion as of the time of writing. Cardano’s native ADA coin also  leaped to a new all-time high of $1.70 on May 7 . The cryptocurrency has grown more than 3,200% over the past year. Cardano has also announced various partnerships and launches over the past month. Despite this, Beck backs layer-two solutions over Cardano, saying: “More DeFi users will flock to Layer 2 networks that are Ethereum compatible. DeFi developers are looking to move their applications and users on to layer 2 in order to take advantage of lower gas fees.” According to L2 Beat, the TVL in layer-two solutions has  increased  nearly twentyfold, from $38.4 million on Jan. 1 to around $718 million at the time of writing. It briefly even surpassed $1 billion in both March and April. Beck further stated: “Synthetix and dYdX have announced they have been ardently working on integrating with Layer 2 solutions. Synthetix has been working with Optimism for months now, while dYdX recently announced that their new cross-margined perpetuals are live on Starkware’s STARK based roll-up solution. We expect this trend to accentuate for the rest of the year.” Among the several coins seeing unprecedented gains — in addition to Ether and the native cryptocurrencies of Ethereum alternatives — the Shiba Inu-themed meme coin Dogecoin ( DOGE ) is the one catching the most mainstream media attention. It’s getting so much attention that it could be the  leading indicator for alt season . Related:  DOGE as internet money?

cardano,No Section,Cardano Foundation Says ADA Is Perfect Match for Tesla as Token Defies Crypto Crash with New All-Time High,"After Tesla dropped Bitcoin as a form of payment over environmental concerns, multiple crypto projects started showing off their green cred. 
 
In a new  Twitter thread , the Cardano Foundation, a Zug-based organization focused on developing and promoting the fourth-largest blockchain, is making a case for Tesla adopting the Cardano (ADA) token. 
 
Cardano utilizes the proof of stake (PoS) consensus mechanism instead of energy-intensive proof of work (PoW). The Ouroboros protocol randomly chooses slot leaders from active stake pools for verifying transactions. 
 
Presently, Cardano is the biggest PoS blockchain. Ethereum is also in the process of switching to this consensus algorithm. 
 
Cardano developer Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) recently inked a partnership with the Ethiopian government to overhaul the local education system, which is believed to be the biggest deployment of blockchain technology to date. The #Tesla4Ada crown, however, will have to fight it out with plenty of other projects that are marketed as sustainable, including IOTA, Algorand, XRP, Nano and a slew of others. After Telsa CEO Elon Musk announced his U-turn on Bitcoin, the market instantly turned into a bloodbath, with the top cryptocurrency plunging to its lowest level since March 1. 
 
Cardano, however, is among the very few major coins that have managed to weather the crypto mayhem. In fact, it managed to print yet another all-time high of $1.87 at 12:12 p.m. UTC on the Kraken exchange.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Chance of a price crash increases as Cardano (ADA) futures near $1B ,"The impressive 816% gain of Cardano's ADA coin in 2021 catapulted the smart contract platform's market capitalization to $61 billion. To fully grasp how far this third-generation protocol has gone, the absolute leader, Ether (ETH), held the same valuation just six months ago. 
 As AD's price evolves, so do its derivatives markets, and the nearly $1 billion in futures open interest poses both an opportunity and a threat for the price. Cautious investors will now question whether the $200 billion in potential liquidations are around the corner, drawing similarities to the 23% crash that occurred on April 17. 
 DeFi is still looking for alternatives 
 There is no doubt that decentralized finance (DeFi) has been fueling the rally in smart contract-focused cryptocurrencies, and the Ethereum network's median fees surging past $35 led investors to seek alternatives. 
 Cardano uses a proof-of-stake mechanism, although still pending its ""Goguen"" update, which will add support for smart contracts and native token issuance. While ADA is inflationary, the supply — currently 32 billion — will be capped at 45 billion. 
 ADA aggregate futures open interest. Source: Bybt ADA's $1.97 all-time high on May 13 caused the open interest on futures contracts to reach $940 billion. Considering that ADA's futures volumes seldom surpass $4 billion, this open interest figure is pretty impressive. 
 The $195-million long contracts liquidation on April 17 was partially responsible for the 23% crash that occurred over four hours. However, a significantly sized open interest cannot be pinpointed as the primary catalyst for cascading liquidations. 
 Leverage is the culprit when it comes to negative surprises 
 Open interest is a measure of the number of open futures contracts, but these are matched at all times between buyers (longs) and sellers (shorts). Thus, the most aggressive liquidations occur when longs are using excessive leverage, and the only way to measure that is through the funding rate. 
 Perpetual contracts are also known as inverse swaps, and these contracts have a funding rate that is usually changed every eight hours. When (buyers) use higher leverage, this fee increases, so their accounts get drained little by little. When a retail buying frenzy occurs, the fee can reach up to 5.5% per week. 
 ADA perpetual futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Bybt The above chart shows how exaggerated the buyers' leverage was ahead of the April 17 crash.  
 A 0.30% funding rate every eight hours equals 6.5% weekly, which is a heavy burden for those carrying long positions.  
 These high funding levels are unusual, and it won't take much to trigger stop orders. That's precisely what happened as Bitcoin's (BTC) price tanked to $52,000 on April 17 and pulled the entire cryptocurrency market south. 
 However, the current funding rate is close to zero on most exchanges, indicating a balanced use of leverage on the buy side and sell side. This means that even as open interest surges, there are no signs that the derivatives market will cause an ADA price crash.

cardano,No Section,"Billionaire Mark Cuban Becomes Cardano-Curious, Says Dallas Mavericks Would Be Happy to Accept It","As Cardano keeps hitting new all-time highs, it has caught the attention of yet another billionaire: Mark Cuban.      
 
The Dallas Mavericks owner recently took to Twitter to  question the utility  of the fourth-largest cryptocurrency, urging IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson to pitch the project to him: Where do you use ADA on a daily basis? How should or could I use it today? I can answer this for all the crypto I own.      Cuban has already dabbled in Bitcoin, Ethereum, and meme crypto Dogecoin, but this is the first time that he publicly mentions Cardano. 
 
When asked about whether the Mavs would accept the cryptocurrency,  the “Shark Tank” host tweeted  that he would be “happy” to sell for ADA if payment processor BitPay were to add it.   Hoskinson—who created Cardano after parting ways with Ethereum—recorded  a video explainer  for Cuban: It’s a big ecosystem. It’s a complicated topic. It’s not Doge. It’s not easy. It’s not just one thing.      He claims that the ecosystem already comprises over a million people: What can you do with your ADA today? You can issue assets, you can buy wine, you can stay in hotels (more than 50,000 locations). Billions of dollars worth of ADA are moving on a daily basis…Unlike Ethereum, you can vote with it…     Much of the video was devoted to exposing the shortcomings of Ethereum. Hoskinson describes it as a “dying monopoly,” taking shots at its scalability issues.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Creator Wants to Help Elon Musk Fix Dogecoin,"IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson has recorded a step-by-step  video explainer  for Tesla CEO Elon Musk to help him fix Dogecoin. 
 
Hoskinson suggests that the meme cryptocurrency has to replace Scrypt with Prism, which can achieve up to 10,000 transactions per second. 
 
The Prism protocol was created as a collaborative effort between MIT, Stanford and other universities. 
 
To keep Dogecoin ASIC-resistant, Hoskinson recommends the HashCore algorithm that aims to make the mining market more accessible, efficient and competitive by stressing computational resources. 
 
The Cardano creator also pointed to Dan Boneh's balloon hashing theory and the idea of rethinking difficulty targets to create a ""much more reasonable"" system. 
 
On top of that, Hoskinson states that Doge has to be quantum-resistant, which is why he suggests adding hash-based signature schemes. 
 
With the help of ErgoScript, Dogecoin can have smart contracts. As  reported by U.Today , Musk proposed scaling Dogecoin by increasing its block size ten times, among some other major fixes. While being lauded by Doge community members, to whom Musk is what Pope Francis is to Catholics, the proposal also attracted sharp criticism from Bitcoiners who accused the billionaire of pulling a Roger Ver by trying to create his own version of the meme token. Some prominent developers recommended that Musk stick to launching rockets, with Peter Todd explaining that Musk's scaling plan would ultimately break consensus: Dogecoin's block interval is already just 60 seconds. That's low enough that larger miners already have a big profit advantage over smaller ones. A six-second block interval with 10MB blocks would just break the consensus.",https://u.today/cardano-creator-wants-to-help-elon-musk-fix-dogecoin,utoday,2021-05-17,16:01:00,en

 ADA’s value has skyrocketed nearly 1,040% since the start of the year, up from $0.18 to $2.08 at the time of publication. The cryptocurrency peaked closer to $2.40 earlier in the week,  setting multiple record highs in the process .  
 As Cointelegraph recently reported,  ADA has entered a new price discovery phase , which means further upside could be in store over the short term. The cryptocurrency now has a market capitalization of $66.1 billion, placing it in the fourth position among active projects. ADA has overtaken Dogecoin (DOGE), Tether (USDT) and XRP amid the latest rally.  
 Perhaps equally as important is the fact that ADA appears to be bucking the current crypto market downtrend. Over the past seven days, ADA has appreciated by 19%. By comparison, Bitcoin (BTC) has declined 22.6%, and Ether (ETH) is down 15.2%.  
 In addition to having one of the most dedicated cryptocurrency communities in the industry, Cardano is also benefiting from positive news from Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. The smart contract platform’s development arm recently explained that its forthcoming Alonzo upgrade is being gradually deployed to the mainnet in May and June.  
 IOHK also recently  partnered with the Ethiopian government  to revamp the African nation’s education system. Under the partnership, IOHK will deploy its blockchain solutions across the country, with up to 5 million students potentially benefiting from the program.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/there-are-now-6-710-cardano-millionaires-following-latest-ada-surge,cointelegraph,2021-05-18,00:00:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano ERC-20 converter nears testnet phase ,"Decentralized finance on the Cardano blockchain is drawing closer to becoming a reality, with a token migration bridge soon to enter the testing phase. According to Francisco Landino, project manager at Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK — the research and development arm responsible for Cardano — the platform’s ERC-20 migration tool is nearing testnet deployment. In a  blog post  published on Monday, Landino said that the ERC-20 converter tool will allow the migration of Ethereum-based tokens to the Cardano chain. The planned ERC-20 converter bridge will follow  Cardano’s highly anticipated Alonzo hard fork , which is touted to bring smart contract functionality to the network. Arguing for the necessity of the ERC-20 conversion tool, Landino wrote: “Once deployed, users of supported Ethereum tokens will be able to bring them over from Ethereum’s congested network and take advantage of Cardano’s transaction capacity and lower fees, while enjoying enhanced security, reduced cost, and interoperability.” As part of the announcement, the IOHK executive also stated that the ERC-20 conversion tool was an important part of efforts to leverage Cardano’s value proposition over Ethereum in terms of parameters, such as scalability and transaction costs. With only a few clicks, crypto projects will be able to migrate their native tokens to the Cardano chain via the converter tool. The Cardano analog will hold the same value as the Ethereum-based “coin,” and the baked-in two-way convertibility means the process can be reversed at a later time. Plans for the converter testnet deployment are already underway, with Landino stating that SingularityNET’s AGI token will be the first ERC-20 coin migrated to the Cardano chain. Moving forward, the IOHK executive said the Cardano team envisages the potential for the ERC-20 converter tool to become a cross-blockchain bridge. Data from DappRadar puts the adjusted total value locked in the Ethereum decentralized finance market at over $68.5 billion. Amid the talk of layer-two solutions being the next frontier for the Ether-based DeFi market, major altcoin chains like Cardano are also looking to become the  de facto home for the emerging DeFi arena .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-erc-20-converter-nears-testnet-phase,cointelegraph,2021-05-18,00:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Exclusive Interview with Cardano’s CTO on Decentralization Process, Next Steps and Dogecoin","Recently I spoke with Romain Pellerin, CTO at IOHK, about his company’s new smart contract integration era and other interesting activities that are happening right now with Cardano. In this interview, he also explains why it is not good that so much attention is drawn to Dogecoin while projects with real use cases remain in the shadows. Don’t miss this piece! 
 
 U.Today: Cardano is currently in the middle of rolling out its smart contract integration era, called Goguen. Can you please give us more details about it? What is it, and what will happen in this era? Romain Pellerin:  The Goguen era has begun. We already had two hard forks in December (Allegra) and February (Mary) in the context of Goguen, in order to support native tokens and NFTs. This summer, we are going to launch smart contract support. The main, big release that is coming is developers’ ability to deploy smart contracts on Cardano. U.Today: Cardano implemented the hard fork Combinator, which allows for the activation of crucial updates without painful and risky chain splits. In your opinion, what prevents other chains from doing something like that, from implementing the same mechanisms? Romain Pellerin:  I think they should do what we did with the hard fork Combinator. The hard fork is determined by looking dynamically at events in the system. Instead of deciding that you need to move to another version of the software at a particular block, we do it when everyone agrees that a new era should start. It is very different. It is more real time and smoother when a clear majority of the network decides that this is the start of a new era. U.Today: What are the next steps for Cardano? What should we expect from your company in the next year or so? Romain Pellerin:  Have you heard about the Catalyst program? It is our funding mechanism governance based on the treasury. It runs community-funded projects that will bring new developers and new initiatives to the Cardano ecosystem. We call this “governance” because the community itself is in charge of deciding future innovation on Cardano. There is a process of decentralization happening. We decentralized block production, we are going to decentralize network topology, and we are also going to decentralize the governance of the chain itself. We will be introducing, by the end of the year, the first features to actually offer control of the data, of the protocols, to the community itself. That is what will follow Goguen. We are also working on Hydra, which is a technology of state channels, which will help an enterprise to transact at high speed. If the two of us wanted to transact at a high frequency—let’s say, a million transactions per minute—we could open a state channel, transact between the two of us and then settle as frequently as we want, maybe every 10 minutes or every day, or every week, on-chain. Hydra is working toward scalability. To summarize, we have smart contracts, decentralized governance and more decentralization of the network itself, as well as scalability improvements through state channels. U.Today:  Can you please tell us about the most impressive and promising DeFi project that is ready to utilize Cardano smart contracts right now? Romain Pellerin:  We are currently running a program that is called the Plutus Pioneer Program. We have more than 2,000 developers participating in it. It is basically a way to learn our smart contract language, Plutus, and learn how to develop the dapps that you want to release, including DeFi applications. We will be announcing, at the next Cardano show, some of the names of the participants in this program. There is one that the community already knows about: Liqwid Finance. It has been financed by Catalyst, our decentralized funding program. That is the first announced DeFi application, and I'm sure that DeFi applications from other chains will also run on Cardano because we have a large community of users. Businesses naturally want to increase their audience and gain customers. I would not be surprised to see a DeFi application like SushiSwap or PancakeSwap deciding to release a version of its app on Cardano. U.Today: Ethereum has six years of history and a solid community. The Binance Smart Chain and Tron have ultra-cheap transactions. What, then, is Cardano’s killing feature for retail usage and for dApps? Romain Pellerin:  The main difference between Cardano and the other chains is that we chose to create a robust platform. We did several years of research. We are using formal methods to prove that the algorithms and protocols we are introducing on Cardano are correct and verified. Then we go to implementation after the specifications are proven. Our main focus is on the robustness and quality of the network. What users choosing Cardano will benefit from is the fact that they can run their applications on a robust platform—a platform that is secure to use. In the future, we are also going to release some tools in order to verify the smart contracts. If you want to develop your smart contract the proper way, you need to check if there is anything wrong with it, if there is something that you missed when you wrote your financial application. We have several languages that people can use, including Marlowe and Glow, which are implemented on Plutus and are leveraging Plutus on-chain. The main difference to me is the fact that people can expect a robust platform and a secure experience when developing their apps. We have another interesting feature; we can, for example, make transactions cheaper, or maintain lower transaction costs. We have a protocol parameter that can help us decrease fees in case the price of the ADA token increases. That is what we are currently working on, with the ability for the community to adapt the fees to the market. We do not want a 10x increase in cost when the token increases by 10x, which is a problem that we can see on other chains today. U.Today: Dogecoin created a lot of hype recently, with all of Elon Musk's tweets, for example. What are your thoughts on the matter? Romain Pellerin:  I think this coin is a coin of a particular generation—a generation of irony, I would say. People enjoy memes. I really think that this coin is trendy because it is a sort of meme. I would not consider this technology to be the future of digital finance. It is a project that has been abandoned by the people who were developing it. It is not at all of the same quality or ambition of other solid cryptocurrencies. As for the domain, maybe it will bring some attention to cryptocurrencies and our industry, so maybe it is beneficial in some way. I am just a bit concerned because everyone talks about Dogecoin, and no one talks about other, more relevant projects. We have several hundreds of blockchain ecosystems that are working hard every day to innovate and develop the future decentralized financial system. It takes the spotlight away from other projects, as we can read a lot about Dogecoin and less about innovative and solid products. U.Today: One last question: What advice can you give to our readers and viewers who are looking for a cryptocurrency to invest in? What aspects should they consider? Romain Pellerin:  I am a technical person. I am the CTO of IOHK, and I don't look at cryptocurrencies as a speculative instrument. I look at cryptocurrencies because they have the potential to change the world of tomorrow, to decentralize services. For example, to me, blockchain is a “trust platform.” What is a trust platform? People can transact securely, knowing the history of the user they are interacting with and that the data they are going to use on-chain is secure. I look at blockchain as a disruptive technology, or the technology of tomorrow, to remove intermediaries, lower the cost of transacting worldwide and giving a chance to anyone on the planet. I don't look at cryptocurrencies as speculative instruments. U.Today: Thank you for your time, Romain. I wish Cardano success, and I do believe that the community and the market need such a solid and time-tested company. Romain Pellerin:  Thank you so much for your support. It means the world to us.",https://u.today/exclusive-interview-with-cardanos-cto-on-decentralization-process-next-steps-and-dogecoin,utoday,2021-05-21,16:45:00,en

Cardano investment funds attracted more capital than any other digital asset.  By comparison, Bitcoin funds saw an outflow of $110.9 million during the same week; Ether outflows totaled $12.6 million.  Investors poured $5.5 million into Polkadot funds and $7.1 million into multi-asset investment products, CoinShares said.  In the year-to-date, Cardano investment products have drawn $24 million in institutional assets compared with $4.13 billion for Bitcoin and $924 million for Ether.  CoinShares credited environmental blowback against Bitcoin for the sudden pivot toward proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies like Cardano. The fund manager explained: “Cardano saw the largest inflows of $10 million, which may represent investors actively choosing proof-of-stake coins based on environmental considerations.”  Bitcoin’s flash crash to below $30,000 last week triggered a tidal wave of selling in the market as Ether, Cardano and every other major altcoin  made new local bottoms . As CoinShares noted, Bitcoin volumes on exchanges surged to $155 billion last week, a new all-time high. Markets appeared to be in recovery mode on Monday, though it’s still too premature to declare a bottom.  ADA was among the top-performing cryptos before the market tanked last week.

cardano, Markets News , Cardano leads tepid crypto market recovery ahead of Memorial Day  ,"Cardano ( ADA ) was back in the spotlight Sunday, leading a tepid market recovery following news that the developer network was inching closer to launching smart contracts.  Market update The combined value of all cryptocurrencies rose 4.4% on Sunday to $1.6 trillion,  according  to data from CoinGecko. Among the majors, it was Cardano’s ADA leading the rally with a 17% gain. ADA peaked at $1.70,  according  to TradingView, and was last seen hovering just north of $1.63.  At current values, Cardano was the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a total market capitalization of $52.9 billion.  ADA posted a strong rebound on Sunday after languishing for much of last week. Source: TradingView. Every cryptocurrency in the top 20 reported gains on Sunday. Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) price rose 3.5% to $35,833, Ether ( ETH ) added 4.3% to $2,431, and Binance Coin ( BNB ) climbed 6% to $327. Despite the modest rally, market sentiment remains tilted to the downside this weekend, with investors continuing to speculate about  whether Bitcoin has actually bottomed out . The Crypto Fear & Greed Index has  fallen  to 10 — on a scale of 1–100, where lower scores are associated with “extreme fear.” What’s driving ADA?  The presence of oversold conditions following the latest market correction appears to have worked in ADA’s favor on Sunday. The cryptocurrency briefly penetrated the oversold indicator on the hourly Relative Strength Index on Saturday before rebounding sharply over the next 24 hours.  Prior to the  May 19 crypto market flash crash , ADA was among the top-performing digital assets. It peaked at $2.46 on May 16 before unwinding 55% over the next week. Looking beyond the immediate shift in market sentiment, ADA fundamentals remain intact.  On a fundamental note, ADA supporters are celebrating the launch of the Alonzo smart contract testnet by Cardano’s development team Input Output Hong Kong, or IOHK. As Cointelegraph recently reported,  IOHK was eyeing a gradual deployment  of Alonzo’s testnet in May and June. Early adopters will have the opportunity to test Alonzo Blue, the first alpha testnet, over the next month.  As IOHK  explained : “The ‘Alonzo’ hard fork will bring exciting and highly-anticipated new capabilities to Cardano through the integration of Plutus scripts onto the blockchain. These will allow for the implementation of smart contracts in Cardano, enabling the deployment of a wide range of new DeFi applications for the first time.” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  recently  indicated  in a YouTube video that attention will shift to solving the scalability issue once the Alonzo rollout is complete.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-leads-tepid-crypto-market-recovery-ahead-of-memorial-day,cointelegraph,2021-05-30,00:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Token Distribution Bashed by Block.one CEO Brendan Blumer,"Brendan Blumer, CEO and co-founder of the Block.one team behind EOS.IO software, has raised several important questions about Cardano's (ADA) token distribution. First, Mr. Blumer asked about the benefits of the ADA tokensale over the proof of work (PoW) mechanism in terms of equitability. How was the ADA token sale more equitable than PoW? How long was the distribution period? How much awareness was there for participation throughout the full distribution period? How was it priced? Why do you think liquidity is so low relative to the market cap? He asked about how long the period was initially scheduled for the distribution of ADA tokens between holders. Also, the EOS.IO co-founder questioned the community's awareness in terms of participation in the ADA tokensale through the entire distribution period. Finally, Mr. Blumer announced that he is interested in the process of initial price evaluation for ADA token distribution. His last question challenged not only the first days of ADA token distribution but also its present-day tokenomics. Mr. Blumer is wondering why liquidity on ADA markets is so low in comparison to its market cap. According to  CoinGecko , Cardano's daily trading volume is roughly $5 billion while its market capitalization exceeds $55 billion.

cardano,Markets,Cardano to Launch Its First Cross-Chain Bridge With Link to  Nervos,"Public chain projects Nervos and Cardano said they plan to enable interoperability across their platforms within the next six weeks. The bridge furthers their goals of discovering the industry's ""Bluetooth moment,"" Nervos and IOHK, according to the development team behind Cardano. The launch is significant because it links two ecosystems worth billions of dollars in terms of market capitalization, the companies said in a press release on Wednesday. It is the first bridge for  cardano  (ADA), currently valued at $56.3 billion and the market's fourth most valued crypto. Blockchain accelerator Mousebelt has been tapped to develop the tech, with funding to come from a Nervos grant. The Cardano team will commit expertise and resources to connect its network. See also:  Swiss Asset Manager Valour Launches Cardano and Polkadot ETPs The Force Bridge, as it's known, will allow users to interchangeably transact with Nervos or Cardano's native currencies (CKB and ADA).  It will also enable participants to create their own wrapped tokens – cryptos that are pegged to the value of another – and do so across both chains, according to the release. The bridge is expected to reduce transaction costs across both platforms' cryptocurrencies while reducing the burden for users to possess different wallets to access features from both networks. It will let developers from both chains access services and features to expand their decentralized applications and user bases, the companies said.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Names Top Reasons Why Elon Musk Should Choose Cardano Over Bitcoin ,"During his five-hour appearance on the  Lex Fridman podcast , IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson made a case for Tesla adopting Cardano instead of Bitcoin.   Hoskinson believes that the e-car maker should drop the largest cryptocurrency if it truly cares about sustainability and carbon neutrality: Well, if they truly care about alternative energy, sustainability, carbon reduction, and carbon neutrality, you can’t be in a system where there’s no built-in mechanism to constrain the energy consumption. You know, with proof of stake, energy consumption is a negative. You wanna minimize it. Hoskinson begrudgingly agrees that “there’s some truth” to the argument that Bitcoin could use otherwise-wasted energy. 
 
However, he says that Tesla has to make a “legitimate case” that the proliferation of Bitcoin will also proliferate solar and wind energy. Otherwise, it will have to focus on the greenest crypto. As  reported by U.Today , Hoskinson estimated that Cardano was 1.6 million times more efficient compared to Bitcoin. 
 
Apart from the climate change concerns, Hoskinson also notes Bitcoin is “the least programmable cryptocurrency,” which prevents it from doing “interesting, unique, sexy things.”     For instance, if Tesla wants vehicles to communicate with each other, Bitcoin won’t be suitable for having an Internet-of-Things (IoT) layer, according to the Cardano creator: You need a fundamentally different infrastructure to create such a token and regulate such a system…You need DEXes and stablecoins, and all kinds of mechanics to make something like that possible. Well, that’s really beneficial to Tesla if they can figure this out.   Hoskinson spent a significant portion of the interview trashing Bitcoin, comparing it to a washed-up high school football star with a “beer belly”: You have extremely long sentiment time, you have extremely low programmability, it is not aware of any other system, there is no native way of issuing an asset…You cannot do anything that is interesting or unique.       He believes that the only reason the flagship cryptocurrency is still around is because of all the money that has been invested in it.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-names-top-reasons-why-elon-musk-should-choose-cardano-over-bitcoin,utoday,2021-06-16,17:34:00,en

Roughly 71.7% of ADA’s circulating supply, worth roughly $31 billion at today’s prices, have been staked across 2,665 active pools,  according  to data provider PoolTool. On Thursday, the price of ADA was $1.34, having gained 4%. At current values, ADA is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Cardano remains far and away the most capitalized cryptocurrency in terms of staked value. Industry data  shows  that Ethereum’s staked value is a distant second at $12.2 billion. Solana, Polkadot and Algorand round out the top-five.  Cardano’s staking allows users to earn passive income in the form of ADA without having to lock up their assets for a certain period of time.

cardano, Sponsored , How this trading platform is helping users hold on to their crypto ,"The crypto markets are as volatile as ever — and now, a major trading platform is making it easier to have “diamond hands.” eToro  supports staking, which means that those who purchase and hold supported cryptocurrencies on its platform have a way of growing their capital. According to the platform, the mechanism that’s used to achieve this is not dissimilar to the way that interest accrues in a savings account. With many people beginning to gain exposure to crypto for the first time, eToro says it aims to ensure that the staking process is “simple, secure and hassle-free.” Any rewards that are generated are paid on a monthly basis in the cryptocurrency that was staked in the first place, and coins remain the property of users at all times. According to eToro, it can be complicated for crypto investors to start staking on their own. Using this platform makes the process much more straightforward. A small fee is charged to cover operational, technical and legal costs. How it works Staking is available to all eligible eToro users. Members of the eToro Club receive a higher proportion of rewards according to their tier, and can also enjoy other perks including in-depth market webcasts, dedicated customer success agents, using your debit card to invest on the eToro platform, lower fees and exclusive events. The cryptocurrencies that are currently supported by eToro include Cardano and Tron, with more set to be added in the future. The reward percentage of the monthly staking yield varies depending on which tier of membership a user has. Crucially, absolutely no action is required on the part of those who are eligible, as rewards are distributed directly and automatically. As part of eToro’s push for transparency, all users receive a tailored monthly email that sets out the rewards they received, and how it was calculated. More insights from eToro  here What’s at stake Staking is an emerging crypto trend, and is available for cryptocurrencies that are based on blockchains with a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This means that the likes of Bitcoin and Ethereum aren’t involved in one of these programs — because they use a proof-of-work algorithm. Through PoS, validators are responsible for verifying transactions — receiving rewards in exchange. One of the biggest benefits lies in how these blockchains can be more environmentally friendly than those based on PoW. Ethereum is planning to make the transition to PoS in the not-too-distant future. More than 5.2 million ETH has already been deposited into the contract. One of the dangers associated with staking is that, given how participants are now responsible for keeping the network secure, they can face penalties if they are seen to be acting against the best interests of the network. Using external providers such as eToro helps to remove some of the technical hurdles that may stand in someone’s way, all while giving them greater levels of flexibility. eToro USA LLC; Investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal.

cardano, News ," ADA, DOGE overtake BTC as the most popular cryptocurrencies for US eToro users  ","American users of the popular eToro trading platform are taking up altcoins with growing conviction, with the likes of Cardano's  ADA  and Dogecoin ( DOGE ) becoming more popular buy-and-hold assets than Bitcoin ( BTC ). New research shared with Cointelegraph showed that ADA is the most popular cryptocurrency held by United States-based eToro users, up from third place in the second quarter of 2020. After not making the rankings at all a year ago, DOGE is now the second most-held cryptocurrency among U.S.-based investors.  Rounding out the top five are Tron, Ether ( ETH ) and Bitcoin, which saw its Hold Rank fall from first place a year ago. Despite experiencing one of their biggest-ever market corrections, and certainly the largest in dollar terms, cryptocurrencies remain in favor among retail investors. The research provided by eToro showed that retail investors are confident in the potential of the new asset class moving forward.  Other popular cryptocurrencies for U.S. investors include Stellar's Lumen ( XLM ), Iota's  MIOTA  token and Ethereum Classic ( ETC ). Cardano’s high ranking is hardly surprising, given the massive community that founder Charles Hoskinson has cultivated over the years. As Cointelegraph recently reported,  ADA is the most capitalized cryptocurrency  in terms of staked value at just over $32.6 billion. DOGE, meanwhile, burst into the mainstream this year thanks to an  eye-watering rally through May . At one point during the rally, DOGE surpassed even Bitcoin in terms of tweet volume, which is a good proxy for retail interest.

cardano,No Section,Fortune 500 Companies and 1 Billion Users: Cardano Foundation Shares Its Goals for Next 5 Years,"In his  recent presentation , Frederik Gregaard, CEO of the Cardano Foundation, has shared some lofty goals that the Zug-based organization has for the next five years.     According to the CF strategy, three Fortune 500 companies could hold and use ADA, the native token of the Cardano blockchain, by 2024. Other objectives include increasing the diversity of on-chain activity, publishing three more white papers, and promoting wallet address growth.         
  
By 2026, when the Voltaire era finally arrives, Cardano will turn into a self-sustaining system that will be managed entirely by its users.       
 
The proof-of-stake blockchain plans to develop a suite of services for a nation and on-board 1 billion users.         Furthermore, it expects 10 Fortune 500 companies to hold ADA by 2026.    
 
When it comes to more short-term goals, the Cardano Foundation plans to increase interoperability and on-board 50 banks by 2022.         
 
While Cardano is known for its ambitious goals, critics often mock the project for not fully delivering on them. Last week, plenty of Twitter users started trolling IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson by retweeting his rather poorly aged prediction about the blockchain’s progress from July 2020.      Did any of this happen?  https://t.co/dlQZ4B4cIW Presently, Tesla and Square are the only Fortune 500 companies that have Bitcoin on their balance sheets. None of them hold any altcoins, according to their latest regulatory filings. 
 
As  reported by U.Today , the Cardano Foundation claimed that the blockchain was a perfect match for Tesla because of its environmentally-friendly proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.

He has shared details of rolling out next stages of Alonzo and summarized the highly positive state that the Cardano ecosystem is experiencing at the current stage of work and existence. In particular, Hoskinson noted that there’s an enormous amount of commercial interest, traction and community effort with Cardano at the moment. Brief Update on Alonzo  https://t.co/agkOdCymwp Hoskinson found it amusing that the crypto media made an issue of his  last year's tweet  that in a year, by the end of July, there are going to be a lot of native assets and DApps on Cardano. However, these expectations are realistic, he believes. The ecosystem is quite healthy and viable, as per him. Cardano has a humongous population on every social media channel from Reddit to Telegram. It has seen a tripling in the population size of the Cardano ecosystem since last year and a lot of value accumulation as well. Also, Cardano’s ADA has been added to the Grayscale fund as the third largest holding with a lot of institutional interest, Charles reminded. Hoskinson also reminded the audience that since Mary upgrade was launched earlier this year, thousands of NFTs have been issued and sold on Cardano. Now there are already a lot of plans to launch native tokens, such as SingularityNET, and a lot of DeFi applications. By every measurable KPI, Hoskinson added, the growth of the last year has been remarkable. Smart contracts are nearly here – it’s a long process, because Cardano is so large and is listed on a large number of platforms, so it will take time, he emphasized. Hoskinson also said that Alonzo White was initially planned for Monday this week but it has to be postponed until Monday next week due to certain bugs that were revealed during trials. They will be fixed over the weekend. He mentioned that he expects several hundred people to join the Alonzo White network. The next upgrade, Alonzo Purple, will be broken into two stages. All things considered, the progress is exactly where it needs to be. Alonzo is coming. Overall, in the next ninety days, the amount of activity on Cardano is expected to grow tremendously. The IOHK CEO believes that those who levy criticism at this point at Cardano are either misinformed or malicious. He stated that Cardano remains one of the fastest-growing, most stable, most mature and systematic of cryptocurrency projects, as well, it remains one of the top-mentioned in every social metric in the crypto industry. You can see every week progress being made, every week development being done, and people talking about it on Reddit, Twitter and Telegram, often with their own projects.",https://u.today/theres-enormous-amount-of-commercial-interest-traction-community-effort-with-cardano-now-charles,utoday,2021-07-08,10:48:00,en

Been Busy.  pic.twitter.com/mmYGoBAsPO The new protocol, dubbed Djed, acts like an ""autonomous bank."" This means that pegging to basic fiat currency by buying and selling underlying assets (stablecoins) is ensured. At the same time, the share of cryptocurrency is stored in reserve to hedge against market volatility. The bank also trades reserve currency in order to capitalize itself. As a result of this programmed activity, a reserve ration is greater than one in every moment of the protocol's lifespan. The authors of the paper stressed that this concept is novel as the stability claims of their protocol are precisely and mathematically stated and proven. Besides that, the claims and their proofs are verified by two different techniques, namely bounded model checking and interactive theorem proving.

In his reply to a naysayer, the billionaire mathematician promised two “fun” months as the leading proof-of-stake project is inching closer to launching smart contacts.

This is honestly the level cardano critics are at now. Next two months are going to be fun. Expect a lot of meltdowns and temper tantrums from the paint chip brigade  https://t.co/5d8b1wJEk3 Earlier this month, Hoskinson also hit back at critics who pounced on his poorly aged tweet from July 2020 about “hundreds” of assets and “thousands” of decentralized applications running on top of Cardano. While there are actually thousands of native assets on the blockchain following the launch of the “Mary” hard fork in early March, practically all of them have zero value and activity. The tweet that triggered such an emotional reaction from the IOHK boss was referring to a new prediction market on popular cryptocurrency betting platform Polymarket. 
 
Those who are certain that Hoskinson won’t deliver on his ambitious promise and Cardano will have to delay the launch of functioning smart contracts can now put their money where their mouth is. 
 
The market will resolve in Cardano’s favor if it will be possible to create a smart contract on the blockchain’s mainnet by Oct 1., 2020. 
 
At press time, the market's trading volume is $328,294. Most are betting against Hoskinson, with shares for “No” trading at $0.53.       Even though development timelines tend to be unpredictable, the roadmap of the Alonzo hard fork—which is expected to unleash smart contracts—is pretty straightforward.

cardano, Follow up , Waiting for Alonzo: Cardano smart contracts creep toward full launch ,"The Cardano network is in the watershed phase of its network development and upgrades. The ongoing phase of the protocol’s roadmap is the Goguen phase, bringing smart contracts to the network. This is the third phase of the roadmap after Byron and Shelley. The Goguen phase was split into three stages, Allegra, Mary and Alonzo. The Allegra update went  live  on December 16 last year, and the Mary update was deployed on the mainnet on March 1 earlier this year. This leaves the Alonzo upgrade, which was further split into three different phases, named Blue, White and Purple. While the final deployment of the Alonzo upgrade on the mainnet was planned to be in August 2021, there seems to be a delay in the phase’s release, as Alonzo is still in the testnet part of its progress.  Since Alonzo brings the much-awaited smart contract functionality to the network, the community has been eager to see them in action, as it entails the enabling of decentralized applications (DApps) on the blockchain. On July 15, Input Output HK (IOHK) announced on Twitter that their  Alonzo testnet has hard forked  from the Alonzo Blue to the Alonzo White node, allowing for the expansion of their smart contract functionality on the platform. Although Alonzo Blue offered smart contracts, its availability was only limited to a set of insiders. Alonzo White now allows operators of stake pools, and network developers and 500 validators will be able to test this functionality going forward. The Alonzo White testnet is scheduled to run for a period of two to four weeks before transitioning to the final stage of the Alonzo update, Alonzo Purple. Cardano’s network is in the third phase of its development, known as the Goguen Update, named after American scientist Joseph Amadee Goguen. This update integrates smart contracts into the network, allowing for the creation of DApps. In phases one and two, the network has gone through the Byron and Shelley upgrades which focused on the establishment of the network and its decentralization, respectively. After completing the Goguen phase, which was initially supposed to be finalized in August 2021, the blockchain will go through phases four and five of the project’s roadmap, named Basho and Voltaire. Basho will  improve  the scalability and interoperability of the network, while Voltaire  promises  to make the network “truly decentralized” with the transfer of the entire governance mechanism to network participants, and will no longer be under IOHK’s management. Optimistic prediction fails Despite a well-structured roadmap and phase updates that the network promised, some questions are being raised on its current utility. Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, had  predicted  on July 27, 2020, that in a year’s time there would be hundreds of assets running on Cardano, along with thousands of DApps and “tons of interesting projects.” In the following year, the crowd has called out this optimistic prediction, pointing out the network is nowhere close to the levels of utility that Hoskinson predicted a year ago. Meanwhile, many members of the Cardano community defended the network, saying that the statement made by Hoskinson was just a prediction and not a promise. Hoskinson himself responded to the critics, saying that “There are thousands of assets on Cardano.”  He also  released  a YouTube video on July 8, claiming that the project is progressing in line with the framework of the defined roadmap and that more than $10 million of nonfungible tokens (NFTs) have been sold throughout the network. He added that once Alonzo White is deployed on the mainnet, developers will have the ability to launch DApps and NFTs on the network. Ben Armstrong, youtuber and creator of BitBoyCrypto.com, told Cointelegraph: “The Cardano team hasn't backed away from their smart contract launch period starting in September. Considering how well the Alonzo White hard fork has gone, I don't expect any further delays. That said, Cardano's methodical approach means they'll push a deadline before the possibility of taking a step back on a bad launch.” Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer of Gate.io, a cryptocurrency exchange, told Cointelegraph that the roadmap is still intact. About the questions raised on the utility aspect of the Cardano network, Tatibouet opined that since the Alonzo upgrades’ main proposition in the Goguen phase consists of the implementation of smart contracts on the network, it can’t be judged on its lack of utility until smart contracts have been completely integrated. Armstrong spoke further on the dilemma of smart contracts holding up the network’s growth, saying, “It's a chicken and egg situation. You need smart contracts to really get DApp development going, but you also need killer DApps to draw more development to the space. There are a lot of DApps that are on Ethereum and waiting in the wings for Cardano.” He even mentioned that since blockchain developers are in very high demand at the moment, poaching has become a huge problem. “When ICP hit Coinbase this year, Charles was open about how DFinity poached several of his top engineers. I imagine that has caused some delays in Cardano-specific development across the industry.” Nearly 72% of all ADA is staked At its current state, the low utility of the Cardano network might be impacting one important aspect: The staking of its native token,  ADA . According to data, nearly 72% of all ADA tokens are  staked  on the network,  amounting to around $30 billion  out of a roughly $42 billion market capitalization. This includes 2,745 active pools and a total of nearly 716,000 staked addresses. Tatibouet spoke about the current utility of ADA tokens themselves, saying: “As of now, the two main functions of the ADA tokens are staking and governance. In that regard, it is a very good sign that so many holders have faith in the network and have staked their tokens in the ecosystem.” She also added that it’s important to remember that staking ADA is way more flexible than the usual staking mechanisms of other protocols. It allows stakers to access their tokens at any time that they choose since the tokens aren’t completely locked away from the staker, thus adding to the convenience of staking on the network. Armstrong opined further on the integration of smart contracts that will impact the high proportion of staking in the network, explaining why the tokens are being staked: “They are hodling onto their stack of ADA, not just to use it for gains down the road but also to have a say in the eventual governance coming in Voltaire. Even with the current state of smart contracts, there are already NFTs you can buy and games to play. But once ADA asserts itself in smart contracts, you're going to see that staking figure drop significantly.” Regarding the potential launch of DApps on Cardano after the implementation of smart contracts, Cardano also attempts to propose real-life utility through its network. Earlier in April,  IOHK partnered with the Ethiopian government  in a bid to revamp the country’s education system by leveraging Cardano’s blockchain technology.  Related:  If the peer review system is broken, what the hell is the point of Cardano's reliance on it? In July, Grayscale added ADA to its Digital Large Cap (GDLC), making it the third-largest component of the fund’s basket after Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). Grayscale is seen as a benchmark of institutional interest in the cryptocurrency markets. Duc Luu, executive chairman at Spores Network, an NFT and decentralized finance marketplace based on Cardano, told Cointelegraph: “Cardano promises the possibility of greener blockchain footprint, lower gas fees and higher throughput which we believe makes it a prominent venue for NFTs, as well as DeFi mainstream adoption, which are the two areas that institutional investors are very much interested in.” While discussing the timing of real-time utility coming into the network, Luu further mentioned that he believes it will happen soon, adding: “Cool functions like ERC-20 converter would allow projects to deploy quickly from ETH to ADA. There are many projects like us eagerly waiting in the background for the Cardano smart contract launch.” He also anticipates that in six months from the launch of smart contracts on the network, the Cardano ecosystem will see a drastic change. However, it is important for the Alonzo network upgrade to be on schedule on the mainnet, as it’s highly anticipated in the community. Other upcoming blockchains like Binance Smart Chain (BSC) are growing at a rapid pace, which could lead to some of the protocols to build on it instead.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/waiting-for-alonzo-cardano-smart-contracts-creep-toward-full-launch,cointelegraph,2021-07-28,00:00:00,en

cardano, Altcoin Watch ," Cardano risks 60%-90% drop, warns trader with ADA painting a classic bearish pattern ","Cardano is close to attaining the title of a fully-fledged smart contracts platform following a  critical upgrade in mid-July . The project's founder Charles Hoskinson confirmed that they recently processed the sales of more than $10 million worth of non-fungible tokens atop their public ledger.  Moreover, SundaeSwap, the first DeFi DEX to utilize Cardano smart contracts is expected to launch soon, and many ADA investors interpret this as a potential bullish catalyst for the altcoin. But the Ethereum rival's growth as a project might not lead to higher adoption for its native cryptocurrency,  ADA , at least according to an analysis shared by Peter Brandt, the chief executive of global trading firm Factor LLC. A 60%-90% crash ahead? The veteran analyst shared a bearish setup for ADA in a tweet published Friday. He  cited  a classic technical pattern, known as Head and Shoulders, to predict a downside scenario for the Cardano token that is already up more than 600% on a year-to-date timeframe. In detail, Head and Shoulders forms when the price forms three consecutive peaks atop a single support level, with a condition that the middle peak is higher than other two, which are typically of the same height. The price eventually breaks below the support levels—also called neckline—and falls by as much as the maximum height between the middle peak's top and the support level. ADA visibly fits the description, as shown in the chart shared by Brandt. Cardano's head and shoulder setup. Source: TradingView.com, Peter Brandt The analyst envisioned the ADA/USD exchange rate to drop as far as $0.12, down 90% from the pair's current bid near $1.26. A percentage-based calculation of the Head and Shoulders pattern marked its profit target near $0.35, down 60% from its neckline. Brandt recalled his record of predicting market tops to add strength to his depressive Cardano prediction. For instance, one of his analyses from 2018, involving Litecoin, corrected spotted a descending triangle setup following the altcoin's run-up from $4 to $420 during the 2017's bull run. ""I remember being scoffed at unmercifully when I identified this top in LTC/USD back in mid 2018,"" Brandt tweeted. ""Hey Cardano trolls, take aim."" But can 2018 repeat? The crash that followed the 2017 bull run originated primarily because of the so-called initial coin offering bust. A  study conducted by Statis Group  noted that more than 80% of blockchain startups that raised funds in Bitcoin, Ether, and other top coins of that time, failed to turn up a working product. Meanwhile, a majority of them turned out to be outright scams that sold the raised crypto capital, thus creating a downward pressure on the entire market. Litecoin, Bitcoin, and Ether crashed by more than 80% in 2018 as the ICO FUD pushed investments out. In contrast, the 2020 bull run came in the wake of macroeconomic blunders. The Federal Reserve's  efforts to contain the economic aftermath  of the Covid-19 crisis saw it launching an unprecedented quantitative easing program. As a result, near-zero interest rates and $120 billion worth of asset purchases sent investors looking for better alternatives in riskier markets every month. As a result, Bitcoin boomed from below $4,000 in March 2020 to above $65,000 in April 2021. Meanwhile, altcoins, which tend to tail Bitcoin trends, surged likewise. Cardano's ADA was one among them; it is now trading more than 7,000% higher from its mid-March bottom. The 30-day correlation between Bitcoin and ADA stands near 0.85 above zero, per data  provided by Crypto Watch . Related:  Waiting for Alonzo: Cardano smart contracts creep toward full launch Simon Kim, CEO of crypto venture fund Hashed, told Cointelegraph in March that the 2020-2021 crypto market is entirely different from the one from 2017-2018, noting that the market now is running on a completely different fundamental. He said: ""Firstly, various DeFi projects are creating value based on a clear business model. Secondly, we’re seeing record active investment by institutional investors, and finally, various on-ramps and off-ramps, including not only PayPal and Visa but also large banks, are now emerging.” Rekt Capital, a pseudonymous market analyst,  noted  that ADA needs to close above its weekly close of $1.30 to confirm its long-term bull trend. Cointelegraph's Rakesh Upadhyay also  pointed out  that a break above $1.33 would increase the Cardano token's potential to extend its upside target towards $1.90. ""Conversely, if the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance and slides below $1.20, it will indicate that bears continue to sell at every higher level. That may result in a retest of the critical support at $1,"" Upadhyay warned, nonetheless.

cardano,No Section,John Lennon’s Son Supports Cardano Creator in His Criticism of Crypto Taxation Amendment ,"The younger son of legendary Beatles musician John Lennon,  Sean Ono Lennon , is known for his pro-crypto stance, and his pro-Bitcoin stance in particular. He has taken to Twitter to comment on the recent live stream video published by Cardano and IOHK founder Charles Hoskinson to support his thesis. Lennon tweeted that the crypto industry is about returning power to the people, taking it back from banks and governments. For this reason, he says, crypto is a major threat to economic and governmental hegemony. Thus, he is not surprised that the White House has  supported the amendment  to the crypto taxing initiative suggested by Senator Portman. Lennon supports the recent message to the crypto industry delivered by Charles Hoskinson in a live stream, where he calls for an  industry-wide response  to the tough crypto taxing initiative and anti-crypto U.S. senators and congressmen. Crypto threatens the very pillars of state and economic hegemony, returning power to the people.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Suggests Solutions Against Legal Amendment That May Harm Crypto Industry Badly,"In a recent video, the founder of Cardano and IOHK, Charles Hoskinson addressed the U.S. crypto community regarding the  amendment offered by Senator Portman  and a few others that makes crypto taxation a lot tougher than it is now. Hoskinson has suggested several simple steps that can prevent  this amendment from being adopted  in a vote on Saturday. Some solutions he suggested are the same offered by pro-crypto U.S. Senator Cynthia Lummis in her Twitter blog. Being Productive in the Face of Chaos  https://t.co/Vl3ACtCLy1 Mr. Hoskinson believes that step number one for all members of the U.S. crypto community is calling their senators' and congressmen's offices, emailing them and sending them letters. In all three steps, crypto supporters should tell their congresspeople what their concerns are if the amendment does get passed. Crypto community members should make it clear how important crypto innovation is for the future of average people in the U.S., as well as for businesses. If senators see a tsunami of messages coming in by phone, email and snail mail, at least something might be done, Hoskinson believes. We NEED you. Pls call your Senators. Pls tweet. Pls email. We are facing major headwinds on the Wyden-Lummis-Toomey amendment. Burying financial innovation in red tape & sending devs + miners on info collection wild goose chases for info they don’t know is horrible policy.  https://t.co/7GRNIUkpKs The second suggestion that Hoskinson reckons is vitally important is to create a website where politicians and lawmakers would be divided into two groups: pro-crypto and anti-crypto. That should be an industry-wide effort, he added. The whole industry must come together and set maximalism aside in the face of greater concerns for everyone. At the end of the day, the IOHK founder suggests supporting pro-crypto politicians financially in their campaigns and boycotting those who vote for the Portman amendment and tougher tax measures on the crypto industry. Hoskinson  wants the legislators who vote for the amendment to face the negative consequences from their electorate and realize that they made the wrong choice, facing the political aftermath of their actions. Every time they run for election, Hoskinson hopes, pro-crypto politicians will be met with massive support, while anti-crypto ones will see their support fading. The third important point is that everyone, from large and small companies to average crypto enthusiasts, should educate as many people on crypto and the amendment as possible—by blogging, tweeting about it and more. As for himself, IOHK and  Cardano, Hoskinson  stated that he would do his best to get as much media attention on it as possible and asks other companies—even Cardano haters, like Blockstream and ConsenSys—to do the same. We will eventually get rid of anti-crypto candidates and replace them with those who realize the importance of crypto for the future of humanity, including the way markets will function and how people will be allowed to earn money and pay taxes on it. Besides, political and regulatory decisions made in the crypto industry in the U.S. are likely to set an example to governments around the world.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-suggests-solutions-against-legal-amendment-that-may-harm-crypto-industry-badly,utoday,2021-08-06,11:18:00,en

The amendment works in favour of Proof-of-Work miners and against Proof-of-Stake ones (and crypto projects that run on these consensus algorithms), among other its provisions. The head of the largest and publicly trading US crypto exchange, Coinbase, has tweeted that now we are witnessing one of the moments that may define the future of the crypto industry. By proposing the crypto tax provision and a late amendment to it, supported by the administration of the president Joe Biden, the government is trying to decide which crypto project will survive in the future and which will not. The new amendment favours PoW-based crypto projects and “proof of stake validators to comply with the impossible”.

cardano, Altcoin Watch ," Cardano price is hot, but data shows pro investors haven’t warmed up yet ","Cardano ( ADA ) has been in the spotlight lately partially because of its early 2021 price performance and the fact that its huge fan base has been anxiously awaiting the launch of the network’s smart contract capability in the upcoming Alonzo upgrade.  While the rise of decentralized finance (DeFi) took place and the total value locked in DeFi applications soared above $76 billion, Cardano investors have been waiting for nearly four years for the project to deliver on all its promises. Traders are now trying to determine whether the 50% rally since July 21 was backed by positive expectations or fundamentals. The movement could have been a “return to the mean,” signaling that previous bearish trades were closed after two months of negative performance. ADA/USDT. Source:  TradingView Cardano has been performing negatively partially because of the failed estimates from Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, who  estimated  that the network would have “hundreds of assets,” along with “thousands of DApps” by July. Hoskinson did  defend himself on YouTube  by saying that more than $10 million in nonfungible tokens (NFT) have been sold through the network, but this pales in comparison to his previous estimates. On July 14, IOHK, the blockchain development team behind Cardano, migrated the  Alonzo testnet to an intermediary stage  that allows developers, validators and stake pool operators. And on July 16, the Cardano-based Spores Network, an NFT and DeFi marketplace project, raised $2.3 million.  Despite these bullish developments, veteran technical analyst Peter Brandt said that Cardano’s price chart formed a classical “Head and Shoulders” pattern that could lead to a  60%-or-higher crash . Futures open interest is growing, but what about investor optimism? Let’s take a look at ADA’s derivatives data to cross-check how professional traders are dealing with this duality. ADA futures aggregate open interest. Source: Bybt After peaking at $1.13 billion on May 16, the aggregate open interest in ADA futures contracts plunged to a $285-million low on July 19. Still, traders’ interest in the altcoin appears to be rapidly increasing because the indicator currently stands at $530 million. Longs (buyers) and shorts (sellers) are matched at all times, even though their leverage may vary, so viewing the funding rate is a better way of determining how bullish or bearish those investors are. Derivatives exchanges will typically charge the side demanding excessive leverage every eight hours, and this fee is paid to the opposing side. Neutral markets tend to display a 0%–0.03% positive funding rate, which is equivalent to 0.6% per week and indicates longs are the ones paying it. ADA USD/USDT margined futures 8-hour funding rate. Source: Bybt Ever since the May 19 crash, Cardano’s funding rate has been ranging from zero to slightly negative, indicating that shorts are the ones demanding more leverage. Nevertheless, on Saturday, there were early signs of a trend inversion, but it is not yet confirmed. Professional traders are slightly bearish It is also useful to confirm that the quarterly futures contracts premium reflects a trend similar to the one seen in perpetual contracts because these fixed-date instruments do not have a funding rate adjustment. Therefore, eventual demand imbalances are reflected by a price difference to the regular spot markets. A negative premium is a bearish situation, known as backwardation, and healthy markets should display a 0.2%–1% premium. Retail traders usually stay away from these instruments to avoid the hassle of calculating the futures premium or having to manually roll over positions nearing expiry. OKEx September ADA/USDT futures premium to the regular spot market. Source:  TradingView As shown above, the discount on futures contracts that have been ongoing since May 20 has started to vanish. Although far from a neutral-to-bullish scenario, it reveals a demand increase from longs. Consequently, derivatives indicators show that investors are not yet sold on Cardano’s promises to deliver decentralized applications and tokens.

cardano,No Section,"Peter Brandt Suggests That Cardano, Ethereum and Bitcoin Could Follow Microsoft's Path","In his  recent tweet , long-time trader  Peter Brandt  has suggested that the volatile move that Cardano, Ethereum and Bitcoin are experiencing right now could end up being a mere blip on the radar. 
 
Brandt published two charts about Microsoft, the second-largest company by market cap, to get his point across. 
 
One of them illustrates the stock's turbulent price action in the $12-$27 range that spanned a period from 2007 to 2013. The other, meanwhile, clearly shows that one needs a magnifying glass in order to spot this volatility after MSFT soared to $286. Wildly volatile price behavior at one phase in a market's history can appear as insignificant ripples when viewed through the lens of a longer history.  $MSFT 
 
Will the same phenomenon be true for many cryptos?  $ADA   $ETH   $BTC   pic.twitter.com/3PlpOzfU85 The stock of the tech giant hit its current all-time high of $289.67 on July 23. 
 
The growth of crypto has been compared to that of tech companies since forever, and some such comparisons may seem trite and unsubstituted. Still, the Microsoft example may serve as a valuable lesson for market observers who are hyper-focused on day-to-day price fluctuations. 
 
Bitcoin's seemingly insurmountable high of $20,000 that was reached at the pinnacle of the 2017 bull run now pales in comparison to the current peak of nearly $65,000 that was recorded in March. Of course, one also has to take into account the fundamentals behind the growth. Microsoft was able to successfully morph itself into a  cloud-computing behemoth  in the 2010s, which explains its stellar growth. Crypto, on the other hand, remains largely novel and untested despite seeing much broader mainstream adoption. While the Bitcoin rally has seemingly hit the pause button, Cardano has been on a tear over the past few days. 
 
Earlier today, it hit $1.89, its highest level since May 20 on the Binance exchange.

At $2.07, this marked ADA’s highest price since May 18 and the start of the cross-crypto price rout engendered by China’s mining shakeout. The move was accompanied by impending technological upgrades, notably smart contracts on Cardano, something popular trader Lark Davis described as a “very bullish catalyst.” “A mere 6X would give it the same market cap as Ethereum,” he  noted , forecasting potential gains of “several hundred percent” once the smart contract feature goes live. “Maybe one day Cardano will 50X, but it is not super likely across short time frames considering the market cap.” ADA was thus the second best performer on the day, just behind The Graph (GRT).

The highly-anticipated upgrade will allow users to run smart contracts on the largest proof of stake (PoS) blockchain. 
 
Nigel Hemsley, Cardano's head of delivery, claims that the project's engineering teams and test teams are working ""extremely hard"" as they are rapidly moving toward the hard fork combinator event. 
 
In the meantime, numerous partners are working on their decentralized applications written in the Plutus programming language. 
 
Hemsley says that Cardano will end up with about 500 community members working on the network by the end of the  Purple phase .  
 
The Cardano Foundation team is responsible for cooperating with exchanges. The lion's share of the exchanges have to be on board before the hard fork happens. 
 
By Aug. 16, IOHK will have its final mainnet candidate release for the node Plutus Core. 
 
The Cardano testnet is scheduled to be hard forked on Sept. 1, which will enable the team to see how ""the whole package"" runs in a production environment. 
 
This is going to be the last piece of the puzzle before the Alonzo hard fork gets deployed on mainnet, according to Hemsley: As we come up toward this hard fork, we will deliver the Plutus capability, a full toolbox of smart contract capability, and then we’ll start it right from there. It gives us the foundation to build on Cardano…We'll have more and more dApps and other innovations coming out shortly afterwards. ADA, the native token of the proof of work (PoW) blockchain, has been on a major bullish streak on the verge of the smart contracts launch.

He further dwelled upon the concept of “certified software,” which “exponentially” reduces the chance of such black swan events occurring: If you have a specification and a certain development methodology and tooling, what you can do or an outside auditor can do is prove that implementation follows that specification, and that specification can be well-tested and well-understood…If you do that, your chance of a hack goes down exponentially. Hoskinson further explains that Cardano and Plutus, the blockchain’s smart contract platform, are designed to achieve high assurance. 
 
The billionaire also cautions users that the decision ultimately lies with them, meaning that it’s up to them to choose whether or not they should trust a certain piece of software. Hence, he claims that the single best thing that users can do to prevent a hack is to smarten up. 
 
The Cardano creator claims that there are plenty of impersonation websites for the Daedalus wallet. 
 
Despite routinely warning his followers about  ADA giveaway scams , Hoskinson keeps receiving e-mails from indignant users who were duped by scammers.    As  reported by U.Today , the IOHK team announced that the rollout of Cardano’s smart contracts is going to take place on Sept. 12 with the mainnet launch of the Alonzo hard fork.

The top derivatives regulator has been rudderless since the departure of Heath Tarbert in January. 
 
Behnam was appointed as the CFTC’s acting chairman in January, but he’s yet to be nominated, let alone confirmed by the Senate.

As  reported by U.Today , BitMEX, one of the leading cryptocurrency derivatives exchanges, recently agreed to pay a $100 million fine in order to settle charges brought by the CFTC and FinCEN.
 This case reinforces the expectation that the digital assets industry, as it continues to touch a broader pool of market participants, takes seriously its responsibilities in the regulated financial industry and its duties to develop and adhere to a culture of compliance.       In March, the CFTC also slapped Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, with a $6.5 million fine for inaccurate reporting, but the investigation of the case predated Behnam’s time in office. 
 
In March, Behnam opined that the federal government should have a role in regulating the cryptocurrency market as it continues to see strong retail-investor interest.

cardano,Markets,World Mobile Wraps $39M Token Sale to Launch Mesh Network in Zanzibar,"World Mobile Token Ltd , which facilitates a mobile network built on the sharing economy, has raised $39 million in under five weeks of a public token offering.  The world mobile token (WMT), a utility token launched on the Cardano blockchain in July, sought to raise $40 million in the first five weeks, adding to $5 million that was raised in a private sale.  World Mobile , the U.K.-headquartered telecommunications group that is building the mobile network, is working to bring internet connectivity to  nearly half  of the population of the world still not connected to the Internet, starting in Africa. jwplayer(""jw-video-aG6vplpJ"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/aG6vplpJ""}) The company’s blockchain-powered wireless mesh network – a set of devices or nodes that work together to share data and information without a centralized point of failure – aims to provide affordable internet access to communities typically ignored by traditional telecommunication service providers.  Meanwhile, the public sale of WMT is expected to kick-start the network’s  sharing economy , and incentivize node operators and other WMT owners to improve services and grow the network.   “The primary role of WMT is to incentivize both token holders that want to support the operation of the network by way of delegating their WMT stake to a node operator (stakers) as well as node operators that operate their own nodes,” the company’s  white paper  said.  Read more:  A16z Leads $111M Token Sale for Helium’s HNT World Mobile is currently deploying equipment to 25 sites in the Tanzanian archipelago Zanzibar to give an estimated 100,000 people or more affordable access to the internet, according to Micky Watkins, chief executive officer of World Mobile Group,  Communities will be able to access the World Mobile network via “air nodes'' that can be as simple as a solar panel, a pole and a wireless access point, Watkins said. By avoiding high-traffic frequencies, and using other avenues like TV white space (unused TV channels) or free-space optics, where data is transmitted through space via light, rural communities will have access to cheaper data packages, according to the World Mobile team on the ground in Zanzibar. Any interested local business owner will eventually be able to purchase an air node for around $5,000 from the World Mobile Group to connect their local communities to the internet, Watkins said. They will also be able to earn WMT denominated rewards from transaction fees and as inflation rewards, according to the company  white paper . But not in every country.  “In countries where cryptocurrency is legal, node operators will be able to receive and spend WMT; however, in countries where the regulations have not yet been established then node operators will receive their rewards in the local, stable currency,” George Cox, chief marketing officer at World Mobile Token Ltd., said in an email. Watkins declined to comment on the token sale itself, as the World Mobile Group does not want to take part in the promotion of the token for regulatory reasons. Watkins did say the funds raised via the initial token sale will go into rolling out the infrastructure in Africa, software development and establishing partnerships.  Commercial rollout In 2019, the organization established a solar-powered wireless air node in an isolated  fishing village  in the East African nation of Tanzania. According to Watkins, after the connection was established the team could not go back to the village for about nine months due to the coronavirus pandemic.  With undisturbed access to the internet, the village fishermen were able to expand their customer network, said Andrew Soper, chief commercial officer at World Mobile Group. The fishermen were previously forced to dry the fish, unable to access customers to sell fresh, reducing the value of their catch by 90%, Soper explained.  “So with access to the internet, what we found was these villages, these fishermen, they were selling fresh fish and fresh prawns to Zanzibar to hotels and to neighboring towns. And what really blew us away was that they were actually exporting live crab to Europe,” Soper said.   With the success story of the fishing village and other trials involving schools in Zanzibar, combined with the newly obtained commercial license to operate in the country, World Mobile is getting ready for a commercial rollout.    “For the last three years, we've self-funded the rollout of several proof of concepts and feasibility studies. As of yet we haven't gone commercial. We've just in the last two months acquired our full commercial licenses. And we're now doing the first rollout,” Watkins said.  According to Soper, Tanzanian users connecting to the internet via World Mobile will also be able to enjoy more affordable data packages, with the new connections offering at least double the current amount of data per unit price locally. Users can pay for internet services with their local currency, Watkins said.  “And we expect to have at least 100,000 users before the end of this year is out [or] at the beginning of next year, in Tanzania itself,” Watkins said.  Read more:  Former Apple CEO Gil Amelio Joins Cirus Blockchain Project as Adviser Only people located in participating countries could purchase WMT during the public sale, Cox said. Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Brazil, Chile, countries within the EU, India, Norway, Russia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, UAE, U.K. and Vietnam were the participating countries. Tanzania, where the initial rollout is taking place, was not on the list of countries because regulations do not allow residents to participate in token-generation events, Cox explained. “Those who can’t purchase WMT can still earn WMT by creating a vault and sharing their referral link. (They’ll earn 2.5% on each purchase made using their link by someone in a participating country.),” Cox said.  During the public sale, WMT could only be purchased via the cryptocurrencies  ADA , BNB (BEP2),  BTC ,  DAI  (ERC20), or  ETH  and not fiat currencies.  “This is due to the regulatory requirements of token sales. Once the token sale is complete, then local business owners and users will be able to top up their wallet using local currency in the same way that they currently top up their mobile services,” Cox said. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/16/world-mobile-wraps-39m-token-sale-to-launch-mesh-network-in-zanzibar/,coindesk,2021-08-16,14:39:00,en

cardano,Opinion,How Blockchain Empowers Women in the Middle East,"Across the globe, women have been sidelined when it comes to finance and technology, and the Middle East is no exception. Luckily, things are changing, and the internet is providing new opportunities for learning and inclusion.  Blockchain offers a blank slate in the Middle East: a new industry where the rules have not yet been fully defined and where women can get involved and make it their own when given the right tools.  Amber Ghaddar, Ph.D., is co-founder of AllianceBlock. It is no secret that in areas of the Middle East, women have far less financial autonomy in society than men. A 2020 McKinsey  report  on “women at work” in the Middle East found high inequalities persist, most notably in legal protection and financial inclusion with a significant number of women in the region remaining unbanked.  jwplayer(""jw-video-hrXybFBN"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/hrXybFBN""}) The distribution of knowledge is more egalitarian nowadays, as anyone with access to the internet can learn to code or trade.  Decentralized finance  (DeFi) can help to level the playing field when it comes to women’s finances, removing the need for intermediaries and reliance on centralized institutions that often fail to safeguard their money.  Brilliant initiatives such as  All Girls Code  are shaking up the status quo in the region by encouraging women to code and study science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) subjects at an university. Elsewhere, associations such as  Arab Women In Code  are leading the charge in giving women more skills. In my father’s home country of Lebanon, this institution was involved in hosting the first  all-female hackathon  in 2015, and similar events have continued to gain momentum since then.  Read more:  Crypto Adoption in Middle East Will Come From Unstable Nations | Opinion Where permitted, women in the Middle East stand to benefit disproportionately from access to cryptocurrency. The decentralized and anonymous nature of crypto transactions means that women will not be discriminated against based on their gender and can take control of their money without the involvement of intermediaries. Digital currencies have been making inroads in the Middle East, with Dubai’s first  crypto listing  occurring this year, as well as the Bank of Israel’s trial of a digital  shekel . In developing markets, crypto offers citizens a way to control their money without having to rely on the relative hardship or prosperity of their national economy.  In many areas, women are unequal in both the eyes of society and the law, which is compounded by overt prejudices in everyday life. Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)  findings  show women make up the majority of workers in healthcare and social services sectors in the Middle East and often play the role of homemakers and caregivers.  COVID-19, particularly in emerging markets, has compounded an already existing gender imbalance, with women far more likely to experience economic fallout from the crisis due to their economic status and professions. It is imbalances like this that reflect the necessity of alternative revenue streams and educational pathways for women. In war-torn areas such as Lebanon, there is a huge diaspora among women and men alike, as citizens have had to flee economic crisis and potential starvation. For those citizens who still remain, crypto has become a way to work around a defunct financial system, whose local currency value plummeted more than 80% during an economic crisis that reached its apex in March 2020.  Digital currencies offer a means for women across the Middle East to take control of their finances Citizens have  increasingly  turned to crypto to transfer their money, while using encrypted chat rooms on Telegram to leverage transactions. Here, we see an example of the freedom that cryptocurrencies can bring in times of hardship, providing a safe and anonymous way for people to take control of their finances when state institutions fail to do so. Women who are marginalized in the Middle East should note these freedoms and leverage digital currencies when possible and useful. It's also important to note that blockchain is more than DeFi; it has the ability to reshape supply chains and redefine how countries do business, as well as being a force for social good. The work that  Cardano  is doing in Ethiopia to help the government track student academic performance in local schools is just one of many examples of the amazing ways blockchain’s tracking and data storage capacities can be used for social good.  Looking at these examples, women in the Middle East should take note of all the industries that can stand to benefit from blockchain and how they can make difference.  Read more:  How Bitcoin Helps Afghan Girls Achieve Financial Freedom Weaker governments and population exodus driven by warfare or instability often encourage more widespread adoption of emerging technologies such as blockchain and crypto, as citizens look outside of the state to manage their money and other affairs.  In the same vein, digital currencies offer a means for women across the Middle East to take control of their finances in times of hardship. With a more long-term view, women in the region should take note of the opportunities that the emerging blockchain sphere holds. Female blockchain developers are in high demand worldwide.  Non-commodity based economies with strong higher education rates, such as Jordan, Lebanon and Tunisia, offer ripe opportunities for educated women to enter this exciting sector. When armed with the right education and resources, women in the Middle East can benefit from and contribute to blockchain, which in turn will help to increase their individual economic and social freedom. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/08/17/how-blockchain-empowers-women-in-the-middle-east/,coindesk,2021-08-17,19:52:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Developer Releases Djed Stablecoin Concept. What's New?,"According to the most recent academic paper published by Cardano developer  IOG , the earliest experimental iterations of the Djed stablecoin have already been deployed to six mainstream testnet environments. According to the blog  post  published on Input Output's official website, IOG, Emurgo, and Ergo have joined forces to create an algorithmic stablecoin protocol called Djed. NEW BLOG: Driven by a governing  #algorithm , Djed is the first  #stablecoin  to use formal verification to eliminate price volatility. Want to ensure  #price  stability? Drive  #cryptocurrency  use via more reliable exchange rates? 1/2 Its price stabilization is ensured by smart contracts architecture, which is why it can be seamlessly integrated into decentralized finances (DeFi) protocols of all sorts. 
 
Unlike other mainstream stablecoins, Djed acts as an autonomous bank. Its smart contract design ensures the stability of ""base coin"" reserves and the process of minting/burning stablecoins and reserve coins. 
 
During inaugural releases, Djed gets pegged to the U.S. dollar, but it can work with all types of fiat currencies. Holders of reserve coins, who are responsible for ensuring the stablecoin's liquidity with their inflows, benefit from Djed's tokenomics. IOG promotes Djed as a first-ever ""formally verified"" stablecoin. All its properties are proven by mathematical theorems: price fluctuations limits, peg robustness, reserves protection, and so on. The developers proposed two versions of Djed (Minimal Djed - acting like protocol's MVP - and Extended Djed). The first-ever mainnet implementation of Djed was introduced as SigmaUSD on Ergo blockchain. Then, similar instruments were deployed to Binance Smart Chain’s testnet, Avalanche’s Fuji, Polygon’s Mumbai, Ethereum’s Kovan, Ethereum’s Rinkeby, and RSK’s testnet. As  Cardano (ADA)  approaches its smart contract release, the implementation of Minimal Djed in  Cardano's  Plutus has been completed.",https://u.today/cardano-developer-releases-djed-stablecoin-concept-whats-new,utoday,2021-08-18,11:47:00,en

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Urges Cardano Devs to Create Proof-of-Burn App for ADA,"Founder and CEO of IOHK, the company behind Cardano blockchain,  Charles Hoskinson , has taken to Twitter to respond to the numerous critics of the huge, as they often claim, supply of ADA. He has addressed Cardano developers, suggesting they create an app that would allow anyone to burn ADA should they want to. Proof of Burn Challenge  https://t.co/VD7E1wVb6P In a live stream video, Charles mentioned that every now and then somebody on crypto Twitter would state that  Cardano  should burn some tokens, since the ADA supply is “too high”. Hoskinson has stated that it is time that the Cardano community demonstrates the capability of Cardano to deal with that sort of unfriendly suggestions. He has told the audience about a paper that describes the  “Proof of Burn” mechanism  that allows anyone to destroy cryptocurrencies by sending them to an address from which they cannot be withdrawn or spent in any other manner. Shared the screen of his computer in the video and showed this paper authored by several cryptography experts from IOHK and the Cardano community. According to Charles, this paper is a formalization of the Proof-of-Burn protocol and it describes the process of this mechanism as: 1) generating an unspendable cryptocurrency address to which crypto coins are sent and thus destroyed; 2) a mechanism that check that this address is actually unspendable. The IOHK founder said  that it would be good if the developers who are learning to make apps on Cardano at the moment created a Proof-of-Burn application for ADA. In that case, Hoskinson stated, whenever somebody would again start talking that it is time to burn ADA, he would send them the unspendable ADA address for coin destruction and offer to make a contribution by burning some ADA first. Hoskinson said that he and his team could do that themselves but they do not have the time with the Alonzo fork approaching (the announced data of this hard fork is September 12), so he offered other dev teams in the Cardano community to create such an app. Hoskinson would choose the best one of them. The winner would be given a prize – an NFT of Hoskinson’s favorite lobster toy that is often seen on the microphone in live-streams.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-urges-cardano-devs-to-create-proof-of-burn-app-for-ada,utoday,2021-08-21,10:40:00,en
cardano, Sponsored , One decentralized exchange is positioning itself as the UniSwap of Cardano with a suite of Cardano-tailored DeFi solutions ,"As concerns around the use of the Ethereum blockchain rise, many have turned to the  Cardano  Ecosystem as a solution to the increasing fees and slower transactions that have resulted from the influx of users. ADAX founders have recognized Cardano for its scientific approach to smart contracts, which are believed to redefine the future of DeFi, with a new approach to doing business. As a result,  ADAX  is stepping up to provide a suite of Cardano-tailored DeFi solutions and a trading venue that facilitates token swaps, NFT trading and more. The team behind ADAX shares that the end goal of this project ""is simply to create a benchmark of a liquidity/swapping solution that the Cardano community could easily adopt and re-used for future projects. Providing a full suite of features The platform aims to achieve this vision by using a trustless protocol to conduct censorship-resistant token swaps while leveraging  social-sentiment -based trading tools. Since the platform is fully decentralized, users also maintain full control of their tokens. This feature can be compared to a centralized exchange, where users must give up their private keys to be managed by the platform. Other features the ADAX founders highlight are: User experience The  ADAX  platform strives to follow industry best practices to ensure the user experience is frictionless and easy to use. Token swaps ADAX enables users to execute smart contract-based trades both instantly and cheaper than the Ethereum network. Without using an order book, the platform removes all intermediaries and complex procedures from the process. Social Sentiment Trading Tools A partnership with Stockgeist.AI, a market sentiment monitoring platform, allows ADAX traders to adjust investments based on early signs of social sentiment. Data is collected from social media sites like Twitter and Discord to determine which tokens are gaining traction and which are losing. Wallet integrations Widespread wallet integrations include the full support of Yoroi, GeroWallet and CardsWallet, and several additional API-based integrations on the horizon. Liquidity pools Compared to most liquidity pools, the ones on ADAX do not rely on constantly shifting ratios, with impermanent loss common in low-volume assets. These factors result in undercutting early liquidity providers' risk and reward-based justification. More information on ADAX  here The Future of ADAX The ADAX initial exchange offering (IEO) occurred in June 2021 on ExMarkets.com, one of the first platforms to implement Cardano native token support. The team shares that this IEO was ""tremendously successful,"" as was their oversubscribed private sale. More is in store for the platform, as ADAX continues to leverage strategic partnerships, working with Mate Tokey, one of the co-founders of Bitcoin.com, and Roger Ver, who many know as 'Bitcoin Jesus.' Other efforts to increase the platform's reach have included partnerships with Black Dragon and Charli3, the decentralized open-source oracle for Cardano. These partners have acted as marketing, innovation and technological partners. Other notable relationships include GeroWallet, a Cardano WAllet, and MELD, a non-custodial banking protocol.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Addresses Major Problem Facing Cardano ,"During his recent  ask-me-anything session , IOHK boss  Charles Hoskinson  has touched upon one of the biggest problems facing Cardano: the network effects. 
 
Hoskinson has defended the team’s focus on deep academic rigor, which involves the “not-so-sexy” peer review process, instead of trying to develop “first-to-market” products: This should be not controversial at all. This should be something that we all agree is probably a good idea given the complexity of the underlying protocol.     Hoskinson pointed to the recent  Poly Network hack  to illustrate why rushing things is not the best decision:   
 
When you screw up, other people lose $600 million. The project’s critics often point to the fact that the largest proof-of-stake blockchain will fail to gain traction because competing blockchains of the likes of Ethereum have already reached a high level of adoption. 
 
Prior to that, Hoskinson  opined  that the smart contract industry was still “a very small pond” to make premature conclusions about the dominance of a certain project: They say ‘we’re the dominant platform’. Yes, you’re the dominant platform. It’s like saying you’re the biggest fish in a very tiny pond next to the ocean. No one has won. We’re all fighting right now in a small pond.    Hoskinson is apparently not happy about  non-fungible tokens  and Dogecoin taking over the cryptocurrency discourse. 
 
During the AMA, he complained about parodies and memes dominating the industry, expressing his desire to “transcend” all of this: When we transcend all of that and we return to the entire point of where it began…",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-addresses-major-problem-facing-cardano,utoday,2021-08-22,12:45:00,en
cardano, Altcoin Watch ," Cardano price eyes $3, but ADA chart fractal hints at a potential 40% correction ","Cardano blockchain’s native asset,  ADA , reached a new record high on Monday as investors pinned hopes on an upcoming smart contracts feature that expects to boost the cryptocurrency’s adoption. The ADA/USD exchange rate topped out at $2.899 around 9:00 am UTC, raising anticipations that it would easily close above $3 in the coming sessions. Many analysts, including pseudonymous chartist PostyXBT,  noted  that the Cardano token had entered a “price discovery mode.” Meanwhile, David Gokhshtein  hinted  that ADA/USD might continue its bull run until Sep. 12, the day Cardano is going to integrate a smart contracts feature to its blockchain via the “Alonzo” upgrade. $ADA  is just a monster right now.  I’m trying to figure out it’s price before 9/12/2021. — David Gokhshtein (@davidgokhshtein)  August 23, 2021 
 
 In detail, the  Alonzo upgrade  introduces a native smart contracts development language called Plutus to the Cardano ecosystem. Plutus is already available for testing and brings functional programming to smart contract creation to everyday users. As a result, ADA bulls anticipate the token’s adoption to boom in the sessions ahead as Cardano attracts decentralized application developers — operating in the  emerging decentralized finance  and  nonfungible token  sectors — to its smart contracts ecosystem. Overbought risks But Cardano’s technical indicators predict a short-term shock, something that might have the ADA/USD corrected lower by as much as 40% despite maintaining its long-term bullish outlook. The Cardano token’s daily  relative strength index  (RSI) has ventured deeper into overbought territory, at around 83. Traders consider an RSI reading above 70 as overvalued. As a result, it prompts them to sell the asset to secure maximum profits. ADA/USD daily chart featuring RSI correction fractal. Source: TradingView For instance, a run-up in ADA/USD rates in the first quarter of 2021 pushed its RSI reading above 90. Later, the pair started consolidating sideways while maintaining support near its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the scarlet wave). Related:  Cardano defies Peter Brandt’s 90% crash warning, ADA price doubles to new high ADA’s price now sits atop 114% month-to-date and 1,511% year-to-date profits. At the same time, an oversold RSI pictures an interim profit-taking scenario. So if the Q1/2021 fractal repeats, ADA’s next line of support comes to be near its 50-day EMA at $1.73, almost 40% below the current prices of $2.83.  $ADA  Alonzo fork is in less than 3 weeks. Allegedly 100+ launches coming  And a major Summit  My first targets are going to be above $3 for TP1  I don’t know how high this goes in price discovery so will just play it as we go.

 But a correction won’t necessarily exhaust Cardano’s long-term bullish outlook. Given the potential success of its Alonzo upgrade, the project could  end up attracting more speculative upside bids  for its ADA token.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Number of Cardano millionaires rises by 173% after ADA price hits new highs  ,"Cardano ( ADA ) addresses with a balance greater than $1 million have surged 173% during  the latest ADA price rally . Specifically, the ADA/USD exchange rate gained almost 200% after bottoming out at $1.007 on July 20. The pair reached its record high of $3.02 in the previous session, a move that was followed by a 6.42% price correction to $2.73 at the time of writing. Meanwhile, the same period saw the total number of Cardano wallets that hold at least $1 million worth of ADA tokens surge from 3,625 to 9,830, per information  provided  by data analytics platforms CoinMetrics and Messari. ADA addresses with balance greater than $1 million. Source: Messari, CryptoQuant Additionally, against ADA's 1,455% year-to-date (YTD) gains, the total number of Cardano millionaires surged from 504 to 9,830 — a 1,850% jump. That coincided with erratic  spikes  in Google Trends searches for the keyword ""Cardano,"" signaling retail interest. Furthermore, the number of Cardano wallets holding more than $10 million worth of ADA tokens climbed from 504 on July 20 to almost 1,000. On Jan. 1, there were only 86 wallets with balances above $10 million. Hodling makes Cardano investors rich  ADA's rise in 2021 also led to a spike in the sum of its  unspent transaction outputs , or UTXOs. UTXOs represent cryptocurrencies that have remained unspent in their crypto wallets after deposit. Therefore, if a blockchain network sees a rise in UTXOs, it indicates that most wallets are holding the cryptocurrency instead of transferring it to other addresses — i.e., a weaker selling sentiment. CoinMetrics data fetched by Messari shows that Cardano's UTXO count surged from 816,600 on Jan. 1 to 2.85 million at the time of writing. That illustrates an incredible rise in Cardano investors' ""hodling"" sentiment, something that might have worked as a backstop to ADA's 1,455% YTD rally. ADA UTXO count. Source: CoinMetrics, Messari The decision to hold instead of selling ADA tokens found its cues in Cardano's potential to unseat its top blockchain rival, Ethereum, as the latter experienced  problems with network congestion and higher transaction fees  at the beginning of this year. For instance, ADA/USD surged 579% in the first quarter on  optimism around its ""Mary"" upgrade , a protocol update that made Cardano a multi-asset blockchain. In doing so, the blockchain became compatible with host projects involved in the emerging decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) space. The update, which went live on March 1, was followed up with another  hard fork in July, called ""Shelley.""  The new mainnet introduced Cardano’s proposed proof-of-stake layer, allowing users to contribute to the transaction validation process either directly (by operating a stake pool) or indirectly (via delegation) in exchange for staking rewards.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano chalks a bearish wedge as ADA price soars by over 100% in Q3 ,"The latest rally in the Cardano ( ADA ) market has activated a classic bearish pattern that threatens to lower its prices by as much as 15%. Dubbed as a  rising wedge , the textbook pattern forms when the price consolidates between upward sloping resistance and support trendlines. Its occurrence typically prompts a bearish reversal, confirmed by a voluminous break below the lower trendline.  The profit target during such a negative move comes to be as below as the maximum wedge height. ADA/USD currently ticks all the boxes for forming a falling wedge pattern, as shown in the chart below. The pair now awaits a negative breakdown below its wedge support trendline, which may prompt a correction toward the 50-4H exponential moving average (50-4H EMA; the purple wave) around $2.45. Cardano 4H price chart featuring a potential rising wedge formation. Source: TradingView The said wedge target is a little over 15% below the current ADA/USD rates (~$2.90). “Once the target zone has been reached, it will show if Cardano manages to bounce from there or just sets up for further continuations to the downside,” corroborated Vince Prince, an independent market analyst, in a separate  report  based on the same rising wedge pattern. Prince’s wedge target for the Cardano token was near $2.24. Bulls eyeing massive ADA adoption The downside outlook appeared after  Cardano surged by more than 100% quarter-to-date , hitting a record high of $2.97 on the Binance exchange on Monday. Traders raised their bids for ADA/USD after Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson  finalized integrating a long-awaited smart contracts feature  on the Cardano blockchain via the “Alonzo” upgrade slated for Sept. 12. The news raised hopes that Cardano would directly rival Ethereum, the biggest smart contracts platform, which has been  grappling with network congestion and higher fees . As a result, demand for Cardano’s native asset, ADA, has been steadily growing. Now imagine how much  $ADA  would pump if there were actual projects using their smart contracts. — Blackbeard (@crypto_blkbeard)  August 22, 2021 
 
 Cryptocurrency market analyst Lark Davis  noted  that if Cardano manages to reach the same market cap as Ether’s, ADA’s price will surge to $10 per token. But he reminded that there were more players in the smart contracts ecosystem waiting to dethrone Ethereum. “If it was just Ethereum vs Cardano it would be a much clearer battle of platforms,” Davis tweeted.  “But we also have BSC, Polygon, Solana, Terra, Avalanche, Zilliqa, Elrond, Polkadot, and many others looking for market share. Many of whom are much further ahead in terms of ecosystem building.” The analyst added that ADA/USD might see a pullback after Cardano’s smart contracts launch, citing the popular “buy the rumor sell the news” effect. He advised potential ADA buyers to wait for a correction. At least one technical indicator also pointed toward an imminent correction in the Cardano market. Dubbed as the  relative strength index , the momentum indicator returned a reading above 70, noting that ADA’s current valuation exceeds its demand. ADA/USD daily relative strength indicator reading is 82.91. Source: TradingView Bitcoin correlation Another catalyst that appeared to have played a key role in sending ADA/USD rates higher is Bitcoin. The benchmark cryptocurrency  typically acts as a trendsetter  for rivaling digital assets. When it moves higher, most top altcoins follow suit; similarly, its decline prompts sell-offs across the rest of the crypto market. Data provided by Crypto Watch  shows  that the one-year correlation efficiency between Bitcoin and Cardano is 0.40. This means there is a 40% likelihood that BTC/USD and ADA/USD will move in the same direction. Interestingly, Cardano’s correlation with Bitcoin is also one of the lowest among altcoins. Bitcoin correlation with altcoins, including Cardano. Source: Crypto Watch However, the Bitcoin–Cardano correlation on a 30-day period comes to be 0.53. Meanwhile, the past 24 hours have revised the correlation to 0.60, showing that ADA/USD prices remain influenced by BTC/USD’s interim price trends. In detail, Bitcoin’s price has also rallied in the third quarter, up more than 47% at the time of writing. It recently reached a three-month high of $50,505 on the Coinbase exchange and — like Cardano — started consolidating sideways near its local top.

cardano, Market Analysis , Ethereum traders expect volatility ahead of Friday’s $820M options expiry  ,"Ether ( ETH ) will face a critical $820 million monthly options expiry on Friday, Aug. 27. That will be the first time that $3,000 and higher options will have a real fighting chance, even though bulls seem to have missed a good opportunity to dominate the expiry because they were too optimistic about Ether’s price potential. It is unclear why $140 million of the neutral-to-bullish call options were placed between $3,800 and $8,000, but these instruments will likely become worthless as the monthly expiry approaches. Competition and the success of interoperability-focused protocols impact Ether price The Ethereum network has struggled due to its own success, which consistently leads to network congestion and  transaction fees of up to $20  and higher. Furthermore, the rise of nonfungible tokens and decentralized finance imposed further stress on the network. Maybe some of the inflow that was supposed to move Ether price up went to its competitors, which presented stellar performances recently. For example, Cardano ( ADA )  surged over 100%  quarter-to-date as investors expect its long-awaited smart contracts to launch on Sept. 12.  Solana (SOL), another smart contract contender,  captured one-third of the inflows  to crypto investment products over the last week, according to CoinShares “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly.” Lastly, layer-two scaling solutions like Polygon (MATIC) have also seen 150% gains after successfully  bringing DeFi projects  into its interoperability pool and launching a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) to scale projects on the software development kits. Ether options aggregate open interest for Aug. 27. Source: Bybt.com Notice how the $3,000 level vastly dominates Friday’s expiry with 30,900 ETH option contracts, representing a $100 million open interest. The initial call-to-put analysis shows a slight prevalence of the neutral-to-bullish call instruments, with 13% larger open interest. However, bears seem to have been taken by surprise because 83% of their bets have been placed at $2,900 or lower. To succeed, bears need to push and hold Ether price below $2,900 Nearly half of the neutral-to-bullish call options have expiry prices set at $3,500 or higher. These instruments will become worthless if Ether trades below that price on Friday. The options expiry happens at 8:00 am UTC, so traders might expect some price volatility nearing the event. Below are the three most likely scenarios that will likely happen and their estimated gross result. Keep in mind that some investors could be trading more complex strategies, including market-neutral ones that use calls and protective puts. Consequently, this estimation is somewhat rudimentary. The simplistic analysis weighs the call (buy) options against the put (sell) options available at each strike level. So, for example, if Ether’s expiry happens at $3,050, every neutral-to-bullish call option above $3,000 becomes worthless. Below $2,900:  36,360 calls vs. 32,700 puts. The net result is virtually balanced. Between $2,900 and $3,000:  36,770 calls vs. 20,320 puts. The net result favors the neutral-to-bullish instruments by $48 million. Between $3,000 and $3,200:  55,660 calls vs. 8,320 puts. The net result favors the neutral-to-bullish instruments by $147 million. Above $3,200:  62,260 calls vs. 1,490 puts. The net result favors the neutral-to-bullish instruments by $197 million. Bears will try to minimize the damage, and luckily for them, the honeypot for a favorable price move doesn’t look worthwhile of a significant effort from bulls. As for the excessively optimistic options traders, they should better rethink their strategy for the September expiry. The Ethereum network seems to be its own biggest enemy because the increasing adoption has fueled the rise in competitors’ decentralized finance applications.

cardano,No Section,First Cardano Sidechain Protocol Running on Wrapped ADA to Be Deployed by dcSpark,"According to a press release shared with U.Today, product-based DLT company dcSpark plans to develop the first sidechain project on  Cardano  that will make it compatible with EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) and which will run on wADA (wrapped ADA). The Milkomeda protocol will first be launched on Cardano and then on other non-EVM chains as well. For Cardano, Milkomeda will enable the launch of sidechains connected directly to the mainchain and using wrapped ADA as payment for transaction fees. Milkomedia intends to solve the issue of the latest generation of blockchains (such as Polkadot, Solana, Cardano) of a lack of a strong community of developers and general adoption—something that the Ethereum chain has enjoyed for a long time already. The developer teams attracted to the new ecosystems by dcSpark will be creating wrapped smart contracts for Milkomeda and the sidechains it is going to build in the future. Milkomeda will enable  Cardano users  to stay on the mainnet and execute smart contracts on the sidechain without having to switch wallets or even having to understand the technical details of the process. For Cardano, dcSpark's Milkomeda will also bring what has already been mentioned in Cardano's roadmap—compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine.  wADA  will be utilized as its base asset, and validators for Milkomeda will be picked from the present stale pool operators. After similar sidechains are developed for Solana and other L1 blockchains, those platforms will be able to interact seamlessly.",https://u.today/first-cardano-sidechain-protocol-running-on-wrapped-ada-to-be-deployed-by-dcspark,utoday,2021-08-25,09:14:00,en

cardano, News , Cardano Foundation partners with Coinfirm for FATF and 6AMLD compliance  ,"The nonprofit organization behind Cardano has partnered with blockchain analytics provider Coinfirm to ensure ADA is in compliance with the Financial Action Task Force’s guidelines. In a Tuesday announcement, the Cardano Foundation  said  it would be using Coinfirm’s services to provide Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT) analytics for Cardano’s native cryptocurrency,  ADA . According to the foundation, the integration will allow the project to be “in full compliance” with the guidelines set forth by the Financial Action Task Force, the  European Union’s Sixth Anti-Money Laundering Directive , or 6AMLD, and other regulations applicable to Cardano.  “AML/CFT analytics is essential for a cryptocurrency to receive mass adoption within regulated markets,” said Cardano Foundation head of technical integrations Mel McCann. “The tools and services provided by Coinfirm enables every exchange, custodian, and all other third-parties to clearly track the history of ada held in their wallets.” Coinfirm said it would be able to provide the same AML/CFT analytics for assets minted on Cardano, a number that may grow as the  project prepares to expand  to smart contracts. News of the integration comes as blockchain firm dcSpark  announced  it would be building its Milkomeda sidechain, connecting the Cardano blockchain to Ethereum.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Responds to Weiss Crypto Ratings’ Criticism About Coinfirm’s AML Integration ,"In a recent Twitter thread, Weiss Crypto Ratings analytics agency poured criticism on the Cardano Foundation after it was announced that IOHK's Cardano  partnered with Coinfirm , a provider of anti-money laundering data. Founder of Cardano and IOHK, Charles Hoskinson, recorded a short video to respond to Weiss Crypto Ratings on this. 1/ So.  #Cardano  curators decided to advance regulatory compliance of  $ADA  token, partnering with  #Coinfirm , provider of ( #AML )anti-money-laundering analytics. 
 
Bad move all around, disappointing. Here's why: (THREAD) On Aug. 24, the Cardano Foundation inked a partnership deal with Coinfirm, a provider of AML (anti-money laundering) and CFT (combating the financing of terrorism) data to ensure Cardano will be fully compliant with the guidelines of the international FATF (Financial Action Task Force) regulator. Chief of Technical Integrations at Cardano Mel McCann believes that, in order to achieve mass adoption on regulated markets, a cryptocurrency must have AML/CFT analytics. What Coinfirm does is provide crypto exchanges, custodians and other sorts of third-party companies to track the history of coins held in the wallets of users. Now, this will be available for  ADA  as well. Weiss Crypto has called this a ""bad move all around"" and added that it was disappointing, offering an explanation for its position. The analytics agency believes that this step will push Cardano and ADA to ""choking to death"" after bringing excessive regulation on itself, as happened to the banking system. Another negative effect this will certainly have in the future, according to Weiss Crypto, is that this step makes the Cardano blockchain a ""censorship-prone, politicized, and manipulated network."" Facebook's Diem and CBDCs can work much better here, the tweet says, if  Cardano  wants to go down this route. This move is the exact opposite of that, as it is well known that so-called ""AML"" laws are put in place by the high priests of finance to ensure nothing escapes their view. As we said in the intro, bad move all around, disappointing. Financial elites, Weiss Crypto added, will never accept the crypto industry; therefore, a crypto platform playing by their rules will only ensure its death in the future. The Cardano founder responded that partnerships like these are important since they provide clarity, a lot of business and technical requirements and allow blockchain companies (Cardano in this particular case) to make software better for everyone everywhere and allow Cardano to see more adoption in all regulated and non-regulated industries around the world. pic.twitter.com/DojjMOEBCJ",https://u.today/cardano-founder-responds-to-weiss-crypto-ratings-criticism-about-coinfirms-aml-integration,utoday,2021-08-26,08:25:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Cardano and Smart Contracts, Everything You Should Know: Comprehensive Guide by U.Today","Cardano  (ADA), the largest proof of stake (PoS) blockchain, will be empowered with smart contracts functionality on Sept. 12, 2021. As we are three weeks away from this crucial milestone, the moment has come to take a deep dive into what is going to change for Cardano (ADA) and the entire worldwide blockchain community. In short, like the ETH1-ETH2 merge or EIP-1559 implementation for Ethereum, the smart contract launch is a once-in-a-lifetime event for Cardano (ADA) that can change its status in the blockchain world for good. What do we know so far? Cardano (ADA) smart contracts release is going to be the most significant milestone since the introduction of  public staking  (July 31, 2020) and migration to complete  decentralization  (March 31, 2021). Cardano is a public open-source blockchain platform powered by an Ouroboros BFT proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Cardano was named after Renaissance polymath Gerolamo Cardano, while its native cryptocurrency was dubbed ADA to memorialize computer programming pioneer Ada Lovelace. Cardano (ADA) was first introduced by Charles Hoskinson, computer scientist and blockchain veteran, in 2015. The inaugural release was unveiled in 2017. Cardano (ADA) has no whitepaper: it adheres to proof-of-stake (PoS) principles as a resource-efficient and environment-friendly alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) systems like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and Monero (XMR). Cardano’s development progress is curated by a Zug-incorporated Cardano Community non-profit, while Canada-based Input Output Global (previously, Input Output HK) and Japanese EMURGO were responsible for its software engineering solutions. Besides node software, Cardano’s end user solutions stack includes Daedalus’ “full-fledged” wallet and light wallet Yoroi. In July 2020, with Shelley hadrfork activated through Cardano’s patented Hardfork Combinator, Cardano (ADA) introduced public staking: now its operations are secured by thousands of ADA holders delegating their tokens to different staking pools. In order to ensure fair distribution of staking processes and prevent the network from being whale-dominated, Cardano (ADA) developers introduced a number of eccentric techniques. Since March 2021, IOHK-controlled staking mechanisms have depreciated: all of Cardano’s transactions are verified by community-driven pools. In mid-2021, Cardano (ADA) teams launched  a number of testnets for its Alonzo hardfork that is set to open a new era in Cardano (ADA) progress, i.e., smart contracts functionality. Smart contracts are small software programs intended to perform operations (execute, document or control some on-chain events) predetermined by this or that contract (agreement). Normally, smart contracts are intended to remove the third parties and middleware from the process of contracts execution in a manner that allows all participants in an agreement to be certain of its outcome. Smart contracts are attractive for legal and financial operations due to their trustless nature and the opportunity to avoid enforcement costs and fraud losses. Smart contracts were proposed in the early 1990s by Nick Szabo. In 2014, the idea of smart contracts implementation on blockchain was described in Ethereum’s whitepaper. By 2021, smart contracts are implemented by nearly all major blockchains: Ethereum (ETH), Tron (TRX), Eos (EOS) and so on; Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon Network (MATIC) are two fastest-growing ones. Therefore, Cardano (ADA) is the latest cryptocurrency behemoth to implement smart contracts functionality. Its developers from IOG (IOHK) promote it as the most powerful, secure and resource-efficient smart contracts environment to date. Just like Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano uses the unspent transaction output accounting model (UTXO). In general, it means that the outputs of one transaction immediately become the inputs of another one. At the same time, Cardano’s implementation of this design, Extended UTXO or EUTXO, allows far more complex data processes to go live on the blockchain. EUTXO allows output addresses to contain complex logic to decide which transactions can unlock them and to add complex data to all outputs. In terms of practical usage, it allows Cardano (ADA) scripts to carry a state, i.e., to store and transfer more sophisticated data structures. Also, with ETXO, the validity of the transactions can be checked off-chain before adding it to the next blocks. It prevents transactions from failing due to execution problems and allows the blockchain to empower systems addressing very complicated use cases. The EUTXO model is implemented via Plutus Core, which is a scripting language used by Cardano (ADA). Actually, Plutus Core is similar to Huskell: the significant subset of Haskell can be utilized to write Plutus Core scripts. But the authors of Cardano (ADA) smart contracts will not be required to write something in Plutus Core. There is a Haskell compiler plugin that creates Plutus Core programs. In turn, these scripts are executed by nodes while transaction validation is live on the blockchain. Then, the scripts lock UTXOs as either validator scripts or minting policies, controlling the process of minting and burning tokens. In a nutshell, Cardano (ADA) dApp developers just need to write the code in Haskell to allow a special compiler to turn it into Plutus Core scripts. Marlowe is a Cardano-specific language designed to attract developers with no previous expertise in blockchain and cryptocurrencies coding. It allows dApps teams to write financial designs in a financial language instead of a general-purpose programming language. It also analyzes the behavior of contracts before deploying them on-chain, so it eliminates the possibility of errors and “rug pulls.” Cardano (ADA) newbies can experiment with designs written in Marlowe on a specific Marlowe Playground. Marlowe Playground can be launched in mainstream browsers; once the contract is ready, its devs can emulate the activity of its various participants. Glow programming language is another eccentric novelty by the Cardano Community. First, it allows for the writing of entire dApps instead of isolated smart contracts. Glow generates a matching client code and a logical model of a new decentralized application. Thus, just like Marlowe, it lowers the entry barrier for developers interested in building on Cardano. Proposed by Mutual Knowledge Systems (MuKn), a partner of the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, this language allows the creation of dApps for many blockchains, so it is not a Cardano-specific programming instrument. As the DeFi and NFT manias are nowhere near losing steam, Cardano (ADA) engineers and marketers are focused on creating the most developer-friendly environment for decentralized applications. In Q1-Q2, 2021, the first-ever experimental products from the red-hot segments of non-fungible tokens (NFTs or digital collectibles) and decentralized finances shared their plans to launch on Cardano (ADA). Namely, a first-ever DeFi ecosystem Occam.Fi (OCC) is going to bring all mainstream DeFi functions to the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem. Its inaugural releases will include a launchpad for initial exchange offerings, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange module (DEX), a decentralized autonomous governance toolkit (DAO) and other DeFi-specific functions. Cardano (ADA) already has a pioneering marketplace for non-fungible tokens (NFTs), THEOS. THEOS is incubated by the team behind Occam.Fi, the Occelerator. The THEOS project is focused on the goals of financial inclusion, sustainable development and fair economics. THEOS marketplace had its initial exchange offering organized by OccamRazer, an Occam.Fi native tokensale platform. Revuto (REVU), a first-ever Cardano-based payment protocol, has successfully completed a $1.7 million private sale led by Black Dragon and public tokensale of its core native utility asset, REVU. Revuto (REVU) mechanisms will introduce micropayments, retail payments and blockchain-based subscription payments to all Cardano (ADA) enthusiasts. REVU tokens will also be available for staking. To boost community activities, in August 2020, Input Output Global introduces a unique initiative,  Project Catalyst . It is a combination of a DAO-governed blockchain development workshop and an incubator for early-stage teams. Launched in Q3, 2020, out of stealth, this initiative onboards various Cardano-focused blockchain development teams. The best teams are chosen by a referendum of ADA holders; in the latest rounds, Cardanians can vote from their light wallets and browsers. The most successful applicants are curated by Cardano’s developers: they receive consulting, expertise and marketing support together with lucrative ADA-denominated bonuses. The largest Project Catalyst round, Fund6, is set to take place in September-November, 2021. The organizers expect more than 150 teams to show up while $4 million in ADA tokens are allocated for the winners of Fund6. The list of core focuses for Project Catalyst includes dApps and integrations, decision-making instruments, ""Grow Africa, Grow Cardano"" programs, Cardano's DeFi ecosystem scaling, staking security and non-English versions of Cardano's tools and other opportunities to increase the visibility of Cardano (ADA) worldwide. Along with smart contracts functionality, Cardano (ADA) blockchain will receive its native assets. Unlike Ethereum with its ERC-20 tokens, all Cardano-based tokens will be issued “directly” on the blockchain, just like ADA coin. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson sees “thousands” of assets on the blockchain. XRP-centric exchange  Bitrue  (BTR) will be the first major centralized trading platform to list Cardano’s (ADA) native coins upon release. With the release of smart contracts, the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem will also be empowered with its own native stablecoin, Djed. Proposed by IOG, Emurgo and Ergo, this stablecoin will be algorithmically-backed: the minting and burning of new coins will be controlled by a purpose-made algorithm. As such, all Djed’s crucial metrics are proven by mathematical theorems: price fluctuation limits, peg robustness, reserves protection and so on. Inaugural releases of Djed will be pegged to the U.S. Dollar price while the next iterations are associated with other world currencies. As of Q3, 2021, experimental versions of Djed are deployed to the testnets of all major smart contracts platforms: Binance Smart Chain’s testnet, Avalanche’s Fuji, Polygon’s Mumbai, Ethereum’s Kovan, Ethereum’s Rinkeby and RSK’s testnet. As a result, the release of Djed on Cardano is in the cards. Just like every mainstream blockchain product, Cardano (ADA) has its own seasoned advocates and adamant critics. Typically, Cardano (ADA) is criticised by those who doubt the development activity on its platform. For instance, prominent Bitcoin (BTC) bull, Digital Galaxy CEO Mike Novogratz - who is also the college roommate of ConsenSys co-founder Joseph Lubin - called Cardano (ADA) a “weird cult.” He made headlines with a statement about “twenty of the smartest people...in the space” he spoke to. According to Mr. Novogratz, zero of them identified “traction” on Cardano. Also, some critics of Cardano (ADA) bash not the project but its inventor, Charles Hoskinson. Legendary Bitcoin (BTC) maximalist and Russia Today host Max Keiser slammed Mr. Hoskinson for accepting “bailout money” in 2020. At the same time, the IOHK CEO dismisses all of the accusations from his opponents. He frequently invited Cardano (ADA) critics to have a discussion, but they never answered. Time to get a new group of people.  pic.twitter.com/EU28XcuN1d Asked about the status of the real-world adoption of Cardano (ADA) solutions, supporters of the project share the scheme with dozens of products that integrated Cardano (ADA) or plan to do so. In September 2021, Cardano (ADA) will be empowered with smart contracts functionality. Over the past few months, its engineers (IOG, EMURGO, Cardano Foundation) created an attractive ecosystem for dApp development that includes Plutus Core, Marlowe, Glow and other interesting tools. Cardano (ADA) nurtures a large and passionate community as its Project Catalyst incubated a number of powerful products.

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson responds to criticism over Cardano’s Coinfirm partnership ,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has responded to criticism over the Cardano Foundation’s partnership with Coinfirm, saying it was necessary for the adoption of  ADA .  The Cardano Foundation announced its partnership with the  blockchain analytics provider  on Tuesday, which will see Coinfirm’s analytics being utilized to ensure compliance with frameworks such as the 6th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and Financial Action Task Force’s guidelines. “The tools and services provided by Coinfirm enables every exchange, custodian, and all other third-parties to clearly track the history of ADA held in their wallet,” the announcement read.  Not everyone welcomed the move, however. On Thursday, Weiss Crypto, the subsidiary of financial ratings firm Weiss Ratings, criticized it vociferously via a thread on Twitter, describing it as a “bad move all-around”:  “The excessive regulation is how the banking system was choked to death. With this announcement, it would seem ADA is proudly announcing they want to follow in their footsteps.” Weiss Crypto appeared to be quite irritated with Cardano’s move toward regulatory compliance as it asserted that it is now “closer to becoming a censorship-prone, politicized, and manipulated network.”  “If you’re going down this route, there are far better tools for the job — Facebook’s Diem, CBDCs and the networks they’ll spring up,” the post read.  4/ The whole point is to build a new financial and economic layer, free from the control and repression of those who have brought our world economy to the brink of total failure, able to be sustained only by excessive and aggressive centrally planned intervention. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto)  August 25, 2021 
 
 Weiss Crypto went on to suggest that if some crypto projects or decentralized networks worked toward regulatory compliance, it would “only guarantee your demise.” The Ethereum co-founder and Cardano creator responded with a video message in the thread and emphasized that “the point and the purpose has always been building in layers, building modules, building ecosystems” that enable compliance with local regulations. “So while the base layer of the system doesn’t care if you’re from the United States or China, Japan, wherever, what you can do is add identity and metadata and all kinds of other things, and those other things give you the ability to be in compliance with your business domain, regulated or otherwise,” he said.  Related:  Number of Cardano millionaires rises by 173% after ADA price hits new highs “And that’s the reason these partnerships are important. They provide clarity. They provide a lot of business and technical requirements, and they allow us to make the software better for everyone everywhere, and Cardano to get more adoption in all industries, regulated and unregulated,” Hoskinson concluded.  So  @WeissCrypto  thinks that  #Cardano  devs and ALL of it's users should just go underground and become fugitives from law enforcement.  Yes, AML laws are outdated to solve the problems of tomorrow, but funny how some in crypto think that they are untouchable and above the law. — Dave Dionisio (@Dave_USA01)  August 26, 2021

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano chart painting a bull flag for $3 ADA price ahead of ERC-20 converter launch ,"Cardano ( ADA ) appears to be heading toward a new record high as its downside move takes the shape of a bull flag. In detail, the ADA/USD exchange rate  plunged 16.91% to $2.47 , but the pair’s decline came after a strong move higher, wherein it surged over 120% month-to-date to reach an all-time high of $2.97 on Monday. Therefore, the latest declines have given the impression that Cardano is undergoing a brief pause before it resumes its uptrend. Part of the upside analogy stems from the downward sloping channel itself — two parallel trendlines enveloping the price moves. In addition, the consolidation accompanies falling volumes, indicating a weaker response from traders to pursue the downtrend.  As a result, the shape appears like a  bull flag , as shown in the chart below. Cardano 4H price chart featuring bull flag setup. Source: TradingView Typically, bull flags prompt traders to enter the market at the pattern’s bottom or breakout above the upper trendline’s high. In doing so, traders target levels located at a distance equal to the size of the flag pole — i.e., the height of the uptrend that preceded the bull flag formation. Cardano’s flagpole is $0.58-long. As a result,  ADA/USD’s bull flag target is $3.05  if measured from the pattern’s bottom at $2.47, about 23.65% higher. More bullish cues come from the 50-4H exponential moving average (50-4H EMA; the velvet wave). Traders have shown their intention to hold 50-4H EMA as interim support, somewhat validating a breakout move for ADA/USD if it manages to float above the wave.  The 50-4H EMA has been acting as a market entry level since July 21, 2021. Additional support confluence for ADA/USD comes from the ascending channel’s lower trendline shown in the chart below. The pattern points  toward a major price rebound , with a profit target at its upper trendline. Cardano price chart featuring ascending channel pattern. Source: TradingView In doing so, it could have ADA achieve its bull flag target midway.  Supportive fundamentals  The bullish technical setups emerged majorly due to euphoria surrounding Cardano’s  long-awaited smart contracts feature , set to go live on Sept. 12 via the Alonzo upgrade. The news boosted hopes that Cardano would be able to rival Ethereum, the biggest smart contracts platform, which has lately  struggled with network congestion and higher transaction fees .

 In the latest Cardano 360 event, its top executives announced further plans to attract Ethereum blockchain users. Francisco Landino, project manager at IOHK — the research and development arm behind Cardano — said Cardano would launch the testnet of an ERC-20 migration tool next week.  Related:  Cardano Foundation partners with Coinfirm for FATF and 6AMLD compliance As a result, users will be able to transfer their Ethereum standard tokens (ERC-20) to Cardano’s native blockchain. SingularityNET, a decentralized artificial intelligence network, will migrate its native token, AGIX, from Ethereum to Cardano.  During the event, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson also said that over 100 companies have been planning to move to Cardano in the coming months. The upside outlook also came amid concerns over Cardano’s efforts to gain legitimacy from financial regulators despite championing itself as a “decentralized public blockchain.” Namely, the Cardano Foundation has  partnered with Confirm , a blockchain analytics firm, to boost its compliance efforts to fall in line with the Financial Action Task Force’s guidelines. Nevertheless, Weiss Crypto Ratings, a rating agency for cryptocurrencies, warned that Cardano’s decision would make its network “censorship-prone, politicized, and manipulated.” 4/ The whole point is to build a new financial and economic layer, free from the control and repression of those who have brought our world economy to the brink of total failure, able to be sustained only by excessive and aggressive centrally planned intervention. — Weiss Crypto (@WeissCrypto)  August 25, 2021

cardano, Market Analysis , Altcoin Roundup: Layer-one protocols chip away at Ethereum’s dominance. ,"The rise of  decentralized finance and nonfungible tokens  has transformed the blockchain ecosystem and generated near unimaginable riches for investors, but none of this would be possible without the strong foundation offered by layer-one blockchain networks like Bitcoin and Ethereum.  Smart contracts and layer-two protocols promise to revolutionize the finance and logistics industry, but they require a robust, secure and distributed network to operate on and to ensure their immutability.  Currently, most of the top layer-two projects operate on the Ethereum network, and this has resulted in increased transaction costs and delayed confirmation times due to network congestion.  The network’s recent London hard fork attracted a lot of attention due to the  implementation of a fee-burning mechanism  that could eventually make Ether ( ETH ) a deflationary asset, but it did little to solve the issue of high transaction costs, and the average transaction cost has actually risen since its implementation.  Due to high fees and limited scaling capability, competing layer-one protocols such as Avalanche, Terra and Cardano have been rising in value and attracting new users in recent months as popular projects bridge their ecosystems to these next-generation blockchain protocols. The rush to Avalanche One of the  biggest price gainers  in August has been AVAX, the native token of the Avalanche protocol.  Excitement for the project began to rise following the  release of the Avalanche Bridge  on July 29. The bridge supports new cross-chain bridging between the Avalanche and Ethereum networks, and the user-friendly nature of the product opened the gates for new users to enter Avalanche’s burgeoning ecosystem.  As of Aug. 24, the bridge has processed more than $1 billion worth of transfers between the two networks, and there are plans to list new assets and stablecoins like USD Coin ( USDC ) in the near future.  The  #Avalanche  Bridge (AB) has transferred nearly 1B in Ethereum assets since its launch on July 29.  Now,  $USDC  is available for transfer on AB!  https://t.co/UAY69mBjpo   pic.twitter.com/z5FgpZvQ2U — Avalanche  (@avalancheavax)  August 24, 2021 
 
 The protocol has also teamed up with blue-chip decentralized finance (DeFi) projects such as Aave, Curve and SushiSwap for the “ Avalanche Rush DeFi Incentive Program ,” a $180-million liquidity mining program designed to bring more applications and assets to its growing DeFi ecosystem.  Funds for the program will be used to provide AVAX rewards as liquidity mining incentives for Aave, Curve and SushiSwap users over a three-month period. DeFi protocols native to Avalanche have also seen a dramatic increase in the total value locked on their platforms. Pangolin leads with a $379.4 million total value locked (TVL), and Benqui has already surpassed the $1-billion TVL mark, according to  data  from Defi Llama.  Avalanche also has a transaction burning fee mechanism in place, which has  burned  more than 182,000 AVAX as of the time of writing.  A layer-one with a stablecoin focus Terra is a unique blockchain protocol in that it has a broad focus on using fiat-pegged stablecoins such as the network’s TerraUSD (UST) to power price-stable global payments systems.  The protocol’s native LUNA token saw its price surge 530% between July 20 and Aug. 24 as a  unique token burning mechanism  and ongoing community vote to upgrade the network put pressure on the token’s value.  On Aug. 25, the Terra community successfully voted to migrate the Terra network to the Columbus-5 mainnet, and it is expected to be fully launched on Sept. 9. 1/ The on-chain proposal to migrate the Terra network to the Columbus-5 mainnet has officially passed, with 99.99% of votes signaling ""Yes.""  https://t.co/22CS19RbLV — Terra (UST)  Powered by LUNA  (@terra_money)  August 25, 2021 
 
 The Terra ecosystem has been steadily growing throughout the year as established projects such as Curve and Yearn.finance integrate UST into their stablecoin pools, and new projects launching on Terra blockchain also benefit from its stablecoin payment capabilities.  Terra ecosystem. Source:  Terrians One of the network’s most popular applications is Anchor Protocol, a savings protocol that offers UST holders low-volatility yields on deposits, while LUNA holders can lock up their tokens as collateral to borrow stablecoins.  The platform helped to boost network activity and ecosystem-connected tokens after it  added  Ether as a collateral option to mint UST on Aug. 13. Since the introduction of Ether as a form of collateral for the Terra ecosystem, the total value locked on the protocol has pushed above $6 billion, according to  data  from Defi Llama.  This makes Terra the third-largest blockchain network by TVL behind Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain.  Related:  Stablecoin adoption and the future of financial inclusion Cardano investors anticipate the network’s smart contract rollout Another project that has been gaining traction thanks to the  promise of smart contract functionality  is Cardano, a proof-of-stake blockchain protocol.  The smart contract rollout led Cardano’s  ADA  token to rally more than 190% in the past three weeks, and investors are excited that DeFi applications will launch once the smart contracts are enabled.  The network and token have also benefited from a high rate of engagement in staking pools, and the most recent  data  from PoolTool indicates that 70.98% of the circulating supply of ADA is staked on the network.  The protocol has also developed a nonfungible token (NFT)-maker that allows users to mint NFTs without the need for smart contracts through the creation of “native tokens.”  Discover Native Tokens  Check out the developer portal to learn about: what native tokens are how to mint them ways to create NFTs  why you don't need smart contracts for all this ➡  https://t.co/9AkCXrjxX9 #CardanoCommunity   #Cardano   #blockchain   pic.twitter.com/Oglcg1jTAJ — Cardano Foundation (@CardanoStiftung)  July 22, 2021 
 
 DeFi and NFTs have been the biggest attention grabbers in the crypto ecosystem this year, so the possibility of being able to operate both on the Cardano network may have contributed to ADA’s current rally. As blockchain technology and the cryptocurrency ecosystem continue on the slow march to mass adoption, the field of competing networks is expected to intensify. Ethereum is currently the top layer-one blockchain network in terms of smart contract capabilities and active protocols, but it must continue to evolve because a handful of competitors is quickly gaining ground.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Devs to Fix Bugs Before Testnet Launch and Alonzo Rollout: Charles Hoskinson,"In a recent video posted by the chief of Input Output Global and Cardano, Charles Hoskinson,  has made an update  for the ADA community regarding Cardano entering the final stage of the  smart contract launch . Brief Update on Alonzo  https://t.co/7Ngqdsqp3R He stated that the preparation for the rollout of the final testnet on September 1 is on schedule and everything is green and go for that. Hoskinson has referred to it as the primary testnet, which they will be using for crypto exchanges and other participants, unlike Alonzo Purple launched earlier this month. After the meeting on Friday, the choice between a go and a no-go decision was made and now it’s a go. This testnet is going to roll over on September 1,  as announced by the head of delivery at Cardano , Nigel Hemsley previously, and now Hoskinson has confirmed it. Now, there’s a lot of work to be done over the weekend, according to Charles. The team will have to make sure everything is in line with the latest version of DB sink, etc. So far, the CEO, said that all infrastructure looks green and go or will be green and go by the end of the weekend. When it all rolls over on the Alonzo testnet, it is going to remain there until the update proposal is done on September 9. The latter will roll over on September 12 – this date of the smart contracts launch on Cardano has been announced earlier and made the third largest crypto, ADA, demonstrate a massive rise recently. Hoskinson has summarized that the preparations are going on schedule and things are looking good. So far, there are a few bugs here and there that the team will have to fix. Some of them will be cleaned before the testnet launch, some will be fixed after that. It’s likely to be a “pretty uneventfull rollover and we are pretty happy about it”, the Cardano founder stated. However, Hoskinson has demonstrated an octopus toy. In the present view (colored like a rainbow), it is a “haptopus” (a happy octopus), as Charles explained and will remain so if  the Alonzo launch  on September 12 goes well. If they hit a major issue and have a bad day on September 12, it will be turned into a “sadopus” (a sad octopus) by simply flipping this toy inside out.",https://u.today/cardano-devs-to-fix-bugs-before-testnet-launch-and-alonzo-rollout-charles-hoskinson,utoday,2021-08-28,10:00:00,en

NFTs launched on the Cardano mainnet for the first time as “CardanoKidz” in March.      
 
During a recent appearance on  the Hashoshi podcast , Patrick Tobler, founder of NFT-maker, said that minting NFTs on Ethereum is “unfeasible” at the moment due to high costs associated with the process: It is the complete opposite of what you want from a decentralized open ecosystem. In the meantime, Cardano allows people to mint large NFT collections that cover a wide selection of genres. The list of Cardano’s applications, of course, pales in comparison to that of rival Ethereum, which already has such killer apps as Uniswap.

cardano, Sponsored , This DeFi platform positions itself as a new Compound built on Solana ,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) empower users by getting cryptocurrency assets into the hands of more people. One platform is attempting to make the trading of crypto more accessible and straightforward with the use of  artificial intelligence . Currently, new users must learn about markets and the assets they want to trade, adding to the barriers of getting started. The decentralized exchange,  Soldex , is eliminating these barriers by giving traders the capabilities to use AI-powered trading algorithms developed by users. Beyond its innovative AI trading capabilities, Soldex offers many additional features over other DEXs. Since it is natively built on the Solana blockchain, it resolves many of the infrastructure issues apparent in older systems. It is relatively quick and cheap to use compared to anything built on Ethereum.  To remain decentralized, the internal infrastructure consists of smart contracts and the use of oracles. Throughout the last decade, exchanges continue to evolve to keep pace with the development of the crypto market. The team at Soldex shares, on their platform, “you can experience real-time transactions, conveniently deposit using your exchange wallets and make light-speed swaps. It also allows investors to participate in community governance and incentivized liquidity. The latter means that users can lock their funds for a certain period of time and earn interest on the investment.” Leveraging artificial intelligence  In general, trading financial assets is a complicated task filled with mixed emotions from people. Unfortunately, emotional trading is one of the biggest mistakes people make. To remove the possibility for emotions to influence trading, artificial intelligence can eliminate the feelings and sentiments of real people and make tough decisions as they arise.  The objective of Soldex is to use a neural network algorithm to work on all market conditions. The algorithm will be able to analyze data about the market, make predictions about risks and buy and sell assets on the user’s behalf. As an automated trading suite, it will gather expert data and continue to develop its learning capabilities.  The CEO of Soldex, John Robertson, shares that the “AI will be so far advanced that users will be able to “create their own trading strategies and sell them on the marketplace.” Providing AI trading in a decentralized format can greatly impact the way people view cryptocurrencies. The platform is also completely permissionless, so anyone, regardless of location, can provide liquidity, trade or begin staking without a Know Your Client (KYC) requirement.  More insights on  soldex The future of trading Looking forward, Soldex and HydraSwap, a cross-chain DEX, are looking at new cooperation opportunities between them, including the SOLX token being listed on HydraSwap. HydraSwap will also use the Soldex trading bots on their own platform. Similar to Soldex, HydraSwap is also implementing the newest technologies to their network. The platform is also funded by lead investors, including Define Capital, Kyros Ventures and Momentum 6. Taking a look at their roadmap, users can expect to see SOLX listed on major exchanges, future collaborations with the Solana foundation and a global academy AI course. This course will help explain Solana and  DeFi  to anyone new to the technology, exposing them to the technology and helping to build an impactful community. The platform is in the process of conducting a private sale for 20% of its tokens, which is open to retail and VC investors. SOLX will later become publicly available to users, giving them access to governance rights, feed AI bots and staked. So far, the Soldex community has grown to include over 14k+ members.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Sees $10.1 Million Inflows in Past Week, Surpassing XRP and SOL but Not Ethereum","According to the  latest weekly report  published by  Cardano , institutional investors have been pouring funds into altcoins with Cardano’s ADA and Ethereum being the leaders. These two top coins have been surpassing such digital currencies as XRP, BNB, DOT and SOL. Current massive  inflows from financial institutions  into altcoins are happening after a very long bearish period that started back in 2018. This rise that the  market is witnessing  is down to bullish sentiment toward altcoins rather than toward Bitcoin. Over the past week, the largest amount of funds has flown into the second and third biggest cryptocurrencies. Ethereum has seen $17.1 million coming from investors, and ADA received almost half as less but still a substantial $10.1 million from institutions. Overall, a whopping $24 million has been invested in altcoins via the CoinShares’ hedge fund in the past week. ADA’s rival Polkadot received $1.5 million, XRP has seen an outflow of $0.3 million and BNB lost $3.3 million. The currently trendy altcoin Solana (SOL)  based on Ethereum , which printed an all-time high of $100 on Monday, is trading at $123 at press time and saw a $2.7 million inflow from investors. At the moment, altcoins provide for 32% of the total amount of crypto managed by the company. Back in May, this number constituted 35% and, back in January 2018, it only managed to reach a 30% high.

cardano,No Section,Will Cardano Have Lower Fees? Charles Hoskinson Explains,"During a recent  ask-me-anything session , IOG CEO  Charles Hoskinson  spoke about lowering Cardano’s fees, stating that such a change is up to the community to implement: The community will be in charge of that.   In response to a user who claimed that transactions might get too expensive in the future due to rapid price appreciation, Hoskinson said that ADA holders will have to make a reasonable decision regarding improving the fee structure. 
 
During the Voltaire era, the final piece of Cardano’s roadmap, the proof-of-stake blockchain is expected to become a self-sustaining system. The governance process will be conducted solely by ADA users through improvement proposals. 
 
Hoskinson adds that fees are not the best mechanism for controlling congestion, adding that scaling solutions of the likes of Hydra will be able to mitigate it. 
 
While notoriously  high fees  continue to plague Ethereum, Cardano has an ample opportunity to chip away at the rival’s market share.       
 
In the past, Hoskinson claimed that the exorbitant cost of transactions on the Ethereum chain wasn’t feasible for developers: You can take your DeFi and you can run it on my system for 1/100 to 1/1000 of the cost. Hoskinson also spoke about the “most unique” thing about Cardano that makes it stand out among other popular blockchains. 
 
The crypto tycoon believes that this is the ability to have hard fork combinator events that allow the blockchain to seamlessly implement new features.

cardano, News ," Institutions remain bullish on Cardano and Ether, while BTC outflows persist ","Institutional inflows to altcoin investment products have continued to increase this past week, but the same cannot be said for Bitcoin ( BTC ). In its “Digital Asset Fund Flows Weekly”   report  on Monday, institutional asset manager CoinShares identified overall inflows of $24 million to altcoin-based investment products. The capital flows mark the second consecutive week of inflows to altcoin funds, with investments into altcoin products increasing by 14.3% compared to last week’s $21 million. Ether ( ETH ) was the favored asset among institutional investors, with ETH-based products posting a weekly inflow of $17.2 million. The report noted that products tracking Ether and other altcoins now represent 32% of the sector’s total assets under management (AUM) — just 3% shy of mid-May’s record of 35%. Cardano-based institutional funds posted record weekly inflows with $10.1 million, representing 32% of the week’s total altcoin inflows. Cardano-based instruments now hold 0.15% of the capital locked in crypto investment products combined.  The surge in Cardano ( ADA ) inflows is attributed to anticipation for the network’s Sept. 12 Alonzo upgrade, which will see the project  launch smart contract functionality for the first time . Polkadot and Solana-based funds also saw inflows with $1.5 million and $2.7 million, respectively. Solana (SOL) has now surpassed Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) for assets under management in related funds with $16 million, ranking ninth in terms of AUM with BCH funds in 10th. Despite the bullish momentum surrounding altcoins, the report noted that Bitcoin products continue to see outflows, with a loss of $3.8 million for the period. As such, Bitcoin products have  posted outflows  for 14 of the past 16 weeks. CoinShares estimates that institutional asset managers currently represent an AUM of $56.8 billion combined — attributing the slight week-over-week drop in sector-wide AUM to persistent outflows from Bitcoin-based products.

Blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant  reported  that the amount of Ether held in exchange wallets has declined from 19.45 million on Aug. 18 to 18.75 million on Wednesday.  However, analysts perceive falling reserves as bullish, arguing that traders primarily withdraw their coins from exchanges because they choose to hold them instead of selling them for other assets. Ether balance across exchanges drop as ETH/USD rise. Source: CryptoQuant Additionally, more upside cues for Ether prices have emerged due to  supply squeeze  prospects.  CryptoQuant data shows that more than 6% of Ether’s supply now stands locked inside the Ethereum 2.0 smart contract — i.e., about 7.28 million ETH, worth $25.77 billion at current exchange rates. Total value staked in Ethereum 2.0 smart contract exceeds $25 billion.

Demand prospects against supply squeeze Ether has already climbed over 380% in 2021, with its gains boosted by the  emerging decentralized finance  (DeFi) and  nonfungible token  sector. In comparison, Bitcoin has gained 62% year-to-date against the dollar.  Payal Shah, director of equity and cryptocurrency product development at CME Group, noted that Ether is equivalent to DeFi, a sector that enables users to trade, as well as borrow and lend directly assets to one another without involving central authorities like banks. “Ethereum hosts more than 200,000 ERC tokens, some of which are part of the top 100 largest cryptocurrencies,” Shah  wrote  in a note published mid-August. “Together, with the accessibility of DeFi and the draw of better interest rates, more and more retail consumers will likely turn to the DeFi space.” Data tracker DappRadar  reports  that the total value locked inside Ethereum-backed DeFi protocols has crossed $100 billion. Cardano rivalry But Ethereum is racing against a long list of rivals as it grapples with network congestion and higher fees issues. For instance, Cardano employs a  dual-layer design  to perform computations and settlements separately, thus solving network congestion issues. Additionally, Cardano consumes almost no energy due to its proof-of-stake (PoS) system. Ethereum expects to have  switched fully to PoS by 2022–2023 , which gives Cardano and other Ethereum rivals a lot of room to grow. But Ethereum has a first-mover advantage in the blockchain space, compared to Cardano, which has very few decentralized applications to show. Related:  Institutions remain bullish on Cardano and Ether, while BTC outflows persist “Ethereum is the place to be, already boasting thousands of DApps,” said investment analysts at the Value Trend, adding:  “It simply makes more commercial sense, at the moment, to build an app on Ethereum.” The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

cardano, Sponsored , This decentralized exchange has plans to become the Uniswap of the Cardano ecosystem ,"Cardano offers many opportunities to build custom tokens. The only thing missing is a native exchange list. With no decentralized exchange in existence yet, one platform might have a solution for the native assets created after the Mary hard fork that occurred on March 1st, 2021. Along with native tokens comes multi-asset support to Cardano, which allows users not only to create their own tokens but also to conduct transactions with them directly on Cardano's network. As each new project launches, they will require an exchange to trade their tokens. Cardax  is positioning itself as the native exchange Cardano needs to provide liquidity to projects that create native assets. Ryan Morrison, the founder & CEO of Cardax, has been an active member of the Cardano community since the beginning of the Cardano project in 2017, even speaking on several Cardano podcasts. With this background, he shares his mission with Cardax is “to be the Uniswap of the Cardano ecosystem.” In practice, Cardax will include the ability to trade ADA for any Cardano Native Token, trade a  Cardano  Native Token for another within the same transaction and provide liquidity-sensitive automated pricing using the EAMM protocol. Solving todays’ problems with AMM There is one major difference between Cardax and other decentralized exchanges. That is, DEXs are typically dependent on order books or AMMs to provide market pricing. The team behind Cardax has conducted extensive research on how they can best leverage the two models to provide a positive customer experience when users trade. One of the major problems every AMM faces today is high barriers to entry. An example can be illustrated for those building a Cardano native token. Creating a market to trade against ADA will require pairings of your token and ADA. However, without many ADA tokens, users will end up with a small illiquid pool. Unfortunately, this is a major problem on UniSwap today. Cardax aims to create a system that addresses these issues by minimizing slippage, providing more price transparency and allowing anyone to become a market maker by starting a liquidity pool or being a part of an existing one. More insights on  Cardax A team ready for the future The team behind Cardax has made headway assembling a team with technical experience on  decentralized technology  and was recently selected by the Cardano community as the first DEX to win Cardano’s Project Catalyst, a grant given by the Cardano community projects built on its network. Additionally, within seven days of their presale on the Cardax community, the team raised 1.5 million dollars. Cardax developers continue to be a part of the testing phases of Cardano, including Alonzo white and Alonzo Purple, before the launch of smart contracts on the network. Looking ahead, Cardax is planning to make a public sale of their protocol's token CDX in September. The CDX token allows holders to participate in the protocol's governance. In the next 12 months, Cardax plans to launch so that “people can start trading Cardano native tokens.” The launch date will occur after the Alonzo hard fork and when Cardano decides to release the Alonzo hard fork to the mainnet. This event is expected to occur on September 12th 2021. The team behind Cardax also shares, their goal is to “maintain the platform and make sure it works well for our users” and afterwards, “to start planning for Cardax V2 with more DeFi features and even more users.” Learn more about  Cardax Disclaimer.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's (ADA) Scaling Protocol Compared to Ethereum's Arbitrum,"As explained by Haskell dev Matthias Benkort, software engineering lead at Input Output Global (IOG), the development team behind  Cardano  solutions, off-chain scalability protocols Hydra and Arbitrum adhere to completely different scenarios. According to a recent Twitter thread by Mr. Benkort, there are a number of fundamental differences between his Hydra protocol and Ethereum's solution, Arbitrum. Ethereum Arbitrum vs  #Cardano   #Hydra , a thread about Layer 2 solutions. 
 
??? Ethereum's Arbitrum does not increase traffic pressure on Ethereum's mainnet: instead, it allows users to perform computations off-chain. As a result, it significantly reduces the costs of these computations for users and dApps. As such, only ""basic"" transactions are validated by the mainnet. This approach allows users to make the operations of dApps more cost- and resource-efficient without critical security and decentralization trade-offs. Unlike Arbitrum, Hydra utilizes the mainstream scaling concept of state channels but with many parties and a highly-secure isomorphic structure.  Hydra does not have its own virtual machine (like Arbitrum's A-VM): Hydra transactions are actually  Cardano  (ADA) transactions. As a result, Hydra leverages its ""battle-tested"" design of Cardano (ADA) L1. Hydra processes transactions much faster that Ethereum's Arbitrum. Mr. Benkort  compared  it to the records of in-game processes in poker: In a Hydra head, transaction are settled MUCH faster than on the underlying L1. Think of it as a poker table that you join with a bunch of chips. Many things happen at the table during the game, but only the final state gets recorded at the end of the game, not all the actions. Also, due to the specifics of  Cardano's  (ADA) consensus design - Extended UTXO model (EUTXO), proof of stake (PoS) - disputes over transactions can be resolved more easily than on proof of work (PoW) systems like Ethereum. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) is on the eve of the mainnet activation of Alonzo hardfork. It is designed to bring smart contracts to the largest proof of stake (PoS) blockchain.",https://u.today/cardanos-ada-scaling-protocol-compared-to-ethereums-arbitrum,utoday,2021-09-03,12:31:00,en

Cardano is facing  this storm of commentary just before rolling out its Alonzo upgrade. This is not the first time the Cardano blockchain has faced such criticism and FUD, Hoskinson added—last year it also happened before the launch of the Shelley upgrade, the upgrade that introduced proof of stake (PoS) to the network. Hoskinson has tweeted that he does not find the current ""massive FUD underway"" surprising and has been expecting it. His explanation was that the Alonzo upgrade, along with other major upgrades on Cardano as this most popular proof of stake (PoS) blockchain continues to develop, belongs to the category of things that people ""don't understand or feel threatened by."" As a reminder, one of those who has been massively attacking Cardano and the recently launched testnet with its smart contracts feature has been the co-founder of Ethhub.io and a prominent member of the Ethereum community, Anthony Sassano. On Sunday, he stated that the Cardano blockchain is broken. He posted screenshots shared on Reddit. They show that the recently released Minswap exchange app has stumbled over several big issues. It has been basically useless for users so far since Cardano's EUTXO can now conduct only one single transaction on each block. However, the IOHK team has published a lengthy thread on Twitter explaining what has happened and why the complaints of Anthony Sassano and other users are ""noise and FUD."" As expected, there is a massive FUD storm underway. We saw the same with Shelley last year. It's nothing new. Just people wanting to burn down what they don't understand or feel threatened by.

Why a $500 SOL price target could be ‘conservative’ ,"A high-flying Solana (SOL) refused to land even in the face of a  brutal sell-off in the cryptocurrency market  on Tuesday. Two days later, the price of SOL rebounded to another new all-time high. The SOL/USD exchange rate averted a big pullback over the previous 48 hours and reached $217 for the first time in history.  The pair’s ability to sustain bearish pressure underscored investors’ growing interest in Solana’s blockchain as an emerging rival to Ethereum, a public ledger currently leading the decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token (NFT) sector boom. SOL/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView  “The SOL outperformance in the market recently is more or less the continuation of its growth run in recent times,” said Petr Kozyakov, co-founder and CEO at payment service firm Mercuryo.  “With more than two different NFT project launches and minting going on in the ecosystem per day, there is an unending demand for SOL from retail buyers. As a result, it has kept the price up more than 50% this week despite a market-wide crash.” In detail, Solana hosted the launch of the  NFT Degenerate Ape Academy  on Aug. 15, which featured a collection of 10,000 cartoon apes. They were sold out in just eight minutes and involved 96,000 SOL or about $5.9 million. Solana continued its foray into the NFT space by  enabling an FTX-backed digital collectibles marketplace  earlier this week. FTX, a crypto derivatives platform, revealed that its new NFT venture would enable NFT creators and owners to trade their digital arts cross-chain using Solana and Ethereum.  Solana beats top rivals The cryptocurrency market wiped more than $200 billion off its valuation following a sudden sell-off Tuesday. The leading digital asset by market capitalization, Bitcoin ( BTC ), saw its prices plunge from over $52,000 to almost $42,000 within minutes, which analysts largely blame on cascading  long liquidations . Alternative cryptocurrencies, or altcoins, which more or less tail the Bitcoin trend, dropped in tandem, with the second-largest, Ether ( ETH ),  plunging by up to 23.41% , and its runner-up — another smart contract rival — Cardano ( ADA ),  dropping by 30.89% .

At the same time, the total value locked inside Solana-based DeFi projects has crossed $7.81 billion, per  data  provided by SolanaProject.com. Greg Waisman, co-founder and chief operating officer of Mercuryo, told Cointelegraph that he anticipates SOL to have reached $500 by the end of 2021.

In a  lawsuit  filed Aug. 13, attorneys representing a handful of investors in HYB – the native token of HybridBlock, a now-defunct cryptocurrency exchange started in 2017 by Ohno and his business partner, Rod Jao – say their clients were the victims of a fraudulent scheme. Brian Kang, a Los Angeles-based investor, poured nearly $1.5 million worth of ether into HYB. Other named plaintiffs, including Prasad Hurra, David Kim, David Kwon and Young Jae Kwon, each invested between $70,000 and $250,000 into the scheme. The civil suit against HybridBlock comes as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) continues to hunt down  fraudsters  that took advantage of the largely unregulated initial coin offering (ICO) boom of 2017 and 2018. From January to June of 2018, Ohno and Jao promoted HybridBlock and its ICO on social media, at  conferences , and  in   interviews , raising an estimated $50 million. But instead of their funds being used to build out the HybridBlock exchange and ecosystem as investors were led to believe, the complaint alleges the ICO was a “mere vessel for Defendants’ personal enrichment.” Ohno, Jao and their associates are accused of funneling the money into personal accounts and business accounts belonging to Allysian, an unrelated supplement company also controlled by Jao and Ohno. Farhad Novian and Alexander Gura, the Los Angeles-based attorneys for the plaintiffs, say that Ohno and Jao covered their tracks by claiming to be victims of a hack in August 2019. According to the complaint, the purported hack was disputed by an electronic asset security company hired by HybridBlock after investors, including the plaintiffs, demanded to know where their money was. A report cited in the complaint detailed HybridBlock’s uncooperativeness during the investigation, including providing a “misleading incident report” and “failing to provide complete screenshots, chat logs and login histories of suspect accounts,” as well as its failure to notify investors or law enforcement of the breach. After the alleged hack, Jao and Ohno are also accused of creating the Asia Digital Asset Exchange (ADAX) – described as an “automated liquidity protocol that facilitates trades within the Cardano ecosystem” – in May 2019 to acquire the failing HybridBlock and serve as an “exit vehicle” to funnel funds through to themselves. Novian and Gura told CoinDesk in an interview they are still in the process of serving papers to the defendants, and have not yet made contact with their attorneys. CoinDesk was unable to reach the defendants for comment at the time of publication.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/09/10/olympic-speed-skater-apolo-ohno-sued-over-role-in-alleged-50m-ico-fraud/,coindesk,2021-09-10,16:12:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Soars 17 Percent Ahead of Smart Contract Launch as Charles Hoskinson Takes Aim at Critics,"The price of  Cardano (ADA)  spiked more than 17 percent on the Binance exchange, reaching an intraday high of $2.78. The price action of the native currency of the top proof-of-stake chain is being driven by mounting anticipation surrounding the upcoming Alonzo upgrade, which will bring smart contracts to the network. 
 
The event will occur on Sept. 12 after months of anticipation within the cryptocurrency community.      During a live stream, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson opined that the recent ADA price drop was not related to the concurrency controversy, rebuffing media reports that claim otherwise. The billionaire attributes the decline to the broader cryptocurrency market correction: The market collapsed, and proportionally everything collapsed together. There was no case when everything was green and one thing went down, and that thing went down because we somehow failed to deliver something.        On Sept. 7, the price of ADA briefly tanked by nearly 30 percent to its lowest level since Aug. 19 during a major market sell-off.     
 
As  reported by U.Today , Cardano was subjected to an onslaught of attacks on social media following the bumpy launch of multi-pool decentralized exchange Minswap.       
 
Users started complaining about not being able to perform basic operations on the platform due to errors linked to the blockchain’s eUTxO accounting model. Many made a premature conclusion that the network was only capable of handling one transaction per block, which is  materially false . 
 
Currently, Cardano developers are working on various scaling solutions for dApps on the network. 
 
The crypto mogul also stressed that the mainnet is going to gain more capabilities through a series of periodic upgrades. Hoskinson also slammed the cryptocurrency industry for being “viciously polarizing” and “inhumane” for instantly branding those who make mistakes as a “criminal” or a “psychological liar.”      
 
He expressed his frustration with  some members  of the Bitcoin community who are still convinced that Cardano is a scam. 
 
Hoskinson says that smart contracts could be “tremendously beneficial” for the Bitcoin ecosystem as well as other projects. ",https://u.today/cardano-ada-soars-17-percent-ahead-of-smart-contract-launch-as-charles-hoskinson-takes-aim-at,utoday,2021-09-11,12:36:00,en

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Sell the news? ADA price drops 10% following Cardano’s long-awaited smart contracts rollout ,"The price of Cardano ( ADA ) fell on Monday in line with the  other top cryptocurrencies  despite  the completion of its hard fork upgrade  dubbed “Alonzo,” which introduced smart contract functionality. The ADA/USD exchange rate dropped 10.67% to reach its intraday low of $2.30, partly due to profit-taking sentiment among traders following the pair’s 1,200%-plus price rally this year. Additionally, the intraday sell-off also surfaced in the period of an overall crypto market decline, with top tokens Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) falling 4% and 6.97%, respectively. Top 10 cryptocurrency tokens and their performance in the last 24 hours. Source: Messari Cardano’s drop appeared when its core foundation rolled out a long-awaited smart contracts feature on its public blockchain for the first time. The launch expects to tap the  booming decentralized finance  (DeFi) and  nonfungible token  (NFT) sector as they grapple with slower and costlier transaction fees on the leading smart contracts platform Ethereum. As a result, anticipation for an extended upside boom in the ADA markets was high, with The Value Trend, a financial analyst at Seeking Alpha,  expecting  the Cardano native token to hit $10 should it flip Ethereum to become the leading smart contracts platform. Overall, the belief helped ADA/USD deliver strong profits in the days approaching the Alonzo upgrade. On July 20, the pair was trading for as low as $1. Later, on Sept. 2, its value rose to a record high of $3.16, a 200% rebound. Bullish continuation signals persist Bullish assets tend to consolidate sideways or lower following a strong move upside as some traders decide to secure their profits. At the same time, investors with a long-term bullish outlook buy the asset from weak hands to build long-term investment strategies. The Cardano chart below hints at a similar consolidation phase after ADA delivering a strong 200%-plus bull run. As a result, the probability of the ADA/USD exchange rate continuing its uptrend remains high. ADA/USD daily price chart featuring Bull Flag formation.

Additionally, the Cardano token would need to maintain its foothold above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the velvet wave) near $2.27 to keep its interim bullish bias intact. A drop below the bull flag support and 50-day EMA floor would risk sending ADA to $1.92, its support line from mid-August.

cardano, News , Cardano launches smart contracts after successful hard fork ,"Cardano has announced the completion of its Alonzo hard fork, ushering in its long-awaited smart contract functionality. On Monday, IOHK  tweeted  that the upgrade had been completed successfully at epoch 290, facilitating the creation and execution of smart contracts on the public blockchain for the first time.  Despite celebrating the milestone, Cardano notes that it is still in the “early days for the project,” asserting that now is when “the mission truly begins” in a  blog post  published on the same day: “This is where the mission truly begins as we – the whole community – start delivering on the vision we have all been working towards for so long. Building a decentralized system that extends economic identity and opportunity to everyone, everywhere.” The Alonzo fork enables smart contracts to be written for Cardano using Plutus scripts, which the team describes as “a purpose-built smart contract development language and execution platform using the functional programming language Haskell.” However, the team has encouraged its community to maintain sensible expectations for Alonzo, stating:  “There are high expectations resting on this upgrade. Some unreasonably so. Cardano watchers may be expecting a sophisticated ecosystem of consumer-ready DApps available immediately after the upgrade. Expectations need to be managed here.” Cardano is a public blockchain that was founded by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed by his research firm, IOHK.  While Cardano pledged to rival Ethereum’s dominance in hosting decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 applications, the project has garnered criticism for failing to deliver smart contract functionality until now despite launching in September 2017. Dominic Williams , founder of rival platform Internet Computer, slammed Cardano for the amount of time taken for the protocol to launch smart contracts, stating, “It amazes me that this chain had been in the market for 2 years, and is only just adding support for smart contracts, and people are happy with this progress.” Cardano also copped flak in early September after the first decentralized application (DApp) to launch on its testnet encountered issues relating to failed concurrent transaction processing.  Outspoken Ethereum maximalist Anthony Sassano  tweeted , “Seriously 6 years of ‘peer-reviewed’ research and a $90bil+ market cap later and the first dapp on Cardano can’t even do concurrent transaction processing (aka the very thing you need for DeFi).” The first dapp went live on Cardano today and ADA fanboys are finally discovering that you can't peer review your way out of fundamental issues.  pic.twitter.com/tYQXNcVKGN — Anthony Wassano  (@sassal0x)  September 4, 2021 
 
 Cardano has since sought to address the criticism,  asserting  that DApps built on the protocol “are not limited to one transaction per block.” Related:  Altcoin Roundup: High Ethereum fees kick-start a liquidity migration to layer-1 platforms Despite its detractors, the hype for Candano’s upgrades recently drove its native token,  ADA , into  record highs , with ADA rallying 192% from a local low of $1.06 in late July to tag $3.10 on Sept. 3, according to CoinGecko. ADA is also up more than 1,600% since the start of 2021.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Alonzo Update: Over 100 Smart Contracts Already Running on Network,"The world's third-biggest blockchain has completed the  Alonzo  upgrade that brings smart contracts technology to the network. Implementation of the technology will help Cardano (ADA) to build a wide range of financial applications. Cardano is preventively solving the main issues of competing for blockchain by using predictable transaction costs. After the update, developers will be able to create apps that will utilize the capabilities of the blockchain to the utmost. The monumental update will bring  Cardano's  financial system to another level, bringing it closer to becoming a global financial system with reduced financial and environmental costs. In the first 24 hours, Cardano's network welcomed over 100 smart contracts, in addition to the first decentralized application ready to launch. Most developers that work on the blockchain state that the newly introduced technology is a game-changer. Starting from this moment, developers can build decentralized apps on the blockchain without going through security compromises while working with a centralized application that functions on dedicated servers. While other blockchains have already offered their network capabilities for building decentralized apps, the main problem was the unpredictable cost of transactions and network congestion. In addition to that, some platforms utilized the energy equivalent of entire countries. As a result, small developers had no other choice but to sacrifice their product's sustainability and safety. Thanks to current and previous updates,  Cardano  has already solved most of the issues that blockchain developers face today. The blockchain utilizes a unique mechanism of verifying transactions that is four million times more efficient than Bitcoin. In addition to that, it uses significantly less energy compared to traditional blockchain networks. The mentioned algorithm also allows Cardano to predict transaction costs and ensure the stability of future applications. Everything that Cardano achieved and implemented would not be possible without IOHK, the company behind Cardano. IOHK brings such solutions as smart-contract-free NFTs on networks that lead to the creation of 780,436 NFTs. In addition to Alonzo's update, the company has developed Catalyst, a blockchain innovation fund. Catalyst incentivizes the development of innovative projects in order to support Cardano's blockchain and ecosystem. Catalyst has already funded 90 projects worth over $1.5 billion. The CEO of IOHK, Charles Hoskinson, said that the Alonzo upgrade will be the culmination of six years of complicated development processes that include the best blockchain developers in the industry. The main goal, for now, is to improve the platform and incentivize the adoption of the Cardano network.",https://u.today/cardano-alonzo-update-over-100-smart-contracts-already-running-on-network,utoday,2021-09-14,13:18:00,en

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Ethereum eyes $6.5K bullish target as ETH price chart paints ‘cup and handle’ ,"Ethereum blockchain’s native asset, Ether ( ETH ), faces the prospect of exploding toward $6,500 in the coming sessions. ETH looks like a cup and handle too. Thoughts? — Raoul Pal (@RaoulGMI)  September 15, 2021 The bullish analogy takes cues from a textbook technical pattern dubbed “ cup and handle .” In detail, a cup and handle structure develops after the price first rallies significantly to the upside and then corrects to carve out a rounding bottom, called the “cup.” The move follows a rebound toward the prior high and a failed breakout attempt above the said level. As a result, the price pulls back once again and grinds out a smaller rounding bottom, called the “handle.” Ultimately, the price returns to a prior high for the second time and breaks out successfully, resulting in a move equal to the cup’s depth. So, it seems the ETH/USD exchange rate has painted a cup and is now forming a handle, as is shown in the chart below. ETH/USD daily chart featuring cup and handle formation. Source: TradingView The depth of the ETH/USD’s cup is nearly $2,437. As a result, should the pair retest $4,112 resistance for a bullish breakout move, its prospect of rising by as much as $2,437 will increase. In doing so, Ether would eye a run-up toward $6,549. A Harvard study  shows  that cup-and-handle patterns have a 65% and 68% success rate in forex and stock markets, respectively, on daily timeframe charts. Institutional FOMO on Ether’s upside analogy appears against the backdrop of growing institutional interest. In a  report  published on Sept. 7, Standard Chartered, a multinational banking giant headquartered in London, discussed Ether’s economic use case, adding that the cost to purchase 1 ETH could grow to $26,000–$35,000 in the future. “The current transition to ETH 2.0 could transform ETH by increasing its functionality and scalability and reducing environmental concerns, although it could raise more complex security issues,” the report stated. “Timelines for ETH 2.0 rollout could slip, but in the near term, decreasing net supply — as ETH is staked for ETH 2.0 — should provide price cushion.” In an interview with CNBC, Cathie Wood, CEO of Ark Invest, said that her firm would  split its crypto investments into 60% Bitcoin and 40% Ether . The former AllianceBernstein executive envisioned a higher demand for ETH tokens in the wake of ongoing growth in Ethereum-backed decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token (NFT) craze. “I’m fascinated with what’s going on in DeFi, which is collapsing the cost of the infrastructure for financial services in a way that I know that the traditional financial industry does not appreciate right now,” Wood told CNBC anchor Andrew Ross Sorkin at the SALT 2021 conference in New York. “Our confidence in Ethereum has gone up dramatically as we’ve seen the beginning of this transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake.” Rivalry risks Meanwhile, Ethereum also faced criticism for its inability to resolve higher transaction fees and network congestion issues. That prompted emerging layer-one blockchain rivals, such as  Solana ,  Avalanche  and Cardano, to eat up a portion of Ethereum’s market hegemony. It will take Ethereum another two years to become a fully functional proof-of-stake protocol, per its official roadmap. The transition consists of a  three-step process . In the first, Ethereum has implemented the Beacon Chain to introduce staking on a separate layer. Related:  Cointelegraph Research: Is Solana an ‘Ethereum killer?’ The next step, scheduled sometime later in 2021, will see Ethereum’s original chain  merger with the Beacon Chain .

The  Vercel App  currently puts the number of smart contracts readying to be launched at more than 2,200. Smart contracts have been a long-anticipated feature on Cardano since its launch in 2017, and the functionality was finally enabled with the recent  Alonzo hard fork . Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano and IOHK,  said  on Friday that the decentralized finance (DeFi) space is “up for grabs” now that Cardano supports smart contracts. Hoskinson said that the winners of what he called the “second wave” of DeFi were going to have liquidity and interoperability, the ability to move multi-chain and cost predictability. “We need governance, we need certification, we need insurance, we need regulation on these things, metadata identity… at the same time, you need to decentralize,” he said, adding: “The way we constructed Cardano was for that second wave.” There are several notable projects that have smart contracts in timelock or are planning on launching soon, such as  GREED , a rewards token redistributing Cardano’s  ADA  back to holders;  Liqwid , an open-source and non-custodial liquidity protocol for interest rate curves;  SingularityNET , a platform that lets anyone create, share and monetize artificial intelligence services at scale; and  Cardax , the first decentralized exchange on Cardano.

Despite Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson's claim that the DeFi space is now “up for grabs,“ it was rival Vitalik Buterin who stole the headlines this week with a feature in Time Magazine. What you’re about to read is the smaller version of this newsletter designed for brevity. For the full version of DeFi’s developments over the last week — released a whole lot quicker than Cardano’s smart contracts — drop your email below. Buterin’s Time to Shine Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin was listed in Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people of 2021 this week for his distinguished contributions to the growth of the Ethereum network to over $420 billion in market capitalization, as well as fostering the emergence of decentralized apps and nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. Nominated by Reddit co-founder, Alexis Ohanian, Buterin featured in the esteemed innovators' category alongside vaccine pioneer Barney Graham, AI entrepreneur Sara Menker, and Tesla and SpaceX titan Elon Musk — who is also a notorious meme-coin shiller. Ohanian applauded the ingenuity of Buterin in his profile piece, stating: “No one person could’ve possibly come up with all of the uses for Ethereum, but it did take one person’s idea to get it started. From there, a new world has opened up, and given rise to new ways of leveraging blockchain technology.” Back in April, the 2.3 million subscriber magazine  began accepting crypto payments  for its 18-month digital subscriptions in partnership with Crypto.com following a surge in demand for the asset feature. Fork in the Road  After years of painstaking deliberation over the prospect of implementing smart contract functionality on its platform, Cardano announced the success of its Alonzo hard fork  this week, stating: “This is where the mission truly begins as we — the whole community — start delivering on the vision we have all been working towards for so long. Building a decentralized system that extends economic identity and opportunity to everyone, everywhere.” What began four years ago as a touted Ethereum rival has garnered criticism for its repotedly endless “peer-reviewed research, bumpy DApp launch, and perceived lack of innovation in the smart contract sector. It remains to be seen whether Alonzo can revive ambitions to conquer the biggest players of this market, or will fall short of expectation. Carbon-conscious NFT's Layer-two NFT protocol Immutable raised $60 million this week from firms, including Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research and Gary Vaynerchuk’s VaynerFund, to scale its native NFT gaming projects, among other plans. The protocol boasts 9,000 transactions per second for ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens, zero gas fees, near-instant transactions, and greater scaling capabilities through the utilization of StarkWare’s zk-Rollup. Alongside this, Immutable has also expressed a passion to sustain the carbon neutrality of all NFT assets, marketplaces and games launched on its platform through the implementation of zero-knowledge proofs, and the purchase of carbon credits. Token Performances Analytical data reveals that DeFi’s total value locked has increased 6% across the week to a figure of $125.3 billion — partially rebounding from the sharp pullback of 10.2% recorded the previous week. Technical analysis conducted on  Cointelegraph Markets  and  TradingView  reveals that DeFi’s top-20 tokens by market cap performed sporadically across   the last seven days, with some surmounting a challenge to re-establish key levels lost over the previous week. Synthetix   took the top spot on the podium for bullish gains, recording an impressive 25.5%. Curve came a close second with 22.9%, while Sushi took third with 16.7%. The fourth and fifth places were claimed by Aave and Thorchain with 11.6% and 7.8%, respectively.  Insatiable for stories?

cardano,No Section,"Cardano to Have ""Ultimate"" Scalability with This Solution: Details","One week after Alonzo hardfork activation in mainnet, Input Output Global, the development studio behind Cardano (ADA), releases a detailed explanation of how the new platform can scale with  Hydra . According to a blog post by IOG's Software Engineering Lead Sebastian Nagel, Cardano's (ADA) throughput will be increased with Hydra, a novel off-chain scaling solution based on state channels. NEW BLOG: Hydra, is a key Layer 2 solution which will continue to improve Cardano's scalability by layering a new protocol on top of the existing Layer 1 blockchain  #Cardano   $ADA . 
 
Read more here and join us at  #CardanoSummit2021  for the latest updates https://t.co/IoDR6Mngez   pic.twitter.com/fdq7LBi75N The concept of state channels was pioneered in 2017 by first-gen Ethereum (ETH) scalability network Raiden. Cardano's Hydra moves computations off-chain to reduce transactional pressure on the mainnet. Therefore, Cardano (ADA) serves as a settlement layer only. Hydra does not require global consensus, so it can boost the speed and performance of decentralized applications. Hydra's isomorphic state channels infrastructure includes parallel Hydra Heads. When activated, Cardano's native assets, NFTs and Plutus scripts can run in parallel within multiple ""heads"" simultaneously. Such design allows ""ultimate"" scaling progress for Cardano (ADA), developers included. By Q4, 2021, Input Output Global developers have already deployed ""proof-of-concept"" for Hydra nodes. A developer preview will be demonstrated during the upcoming Cardano Summit on Sept. 25-26, 2021. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano's Haskell dev Matthias Benkort indicated numerous advantages that Hydra has over Ethereum's Arbitrum. Cardano's inventor, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson,  named  L2 solutions among the potential instruments to prevent Cardano from congestion among the criticism that followed issues with testnet smart contracts release on Sept. 3, 2021.",https://u.today/cardano-to-have-ultimate-scalability-with-this-solution-details,utoday,2021-09-18,16:14:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Creator Proposes New Term for Smart Contracts,"IOG CEO  Charles Hoskinson   recently tweeted  that the term “smart contract” is actually a misnomer when it comes to Cardano. 
 
Instead, he suggests that the community has to refer to the new functionality as “programmable validators.” 
 
The semantical inaccuracy was initially noted by IOG developer Matthias Benkort. In his thread, he claims that Cardano’s programmability is drastically different from competing blockchains of the likes of Ethereum and Solana because of its eUTXO transaction model. Hence, smart contracts cannot be actually deployed on Cardano: Unlike Ethereum, Solana, Algorand and al, there's no such thing as ""deploying"" a smart-contract on Cardano. Instead, validators are implicitly referred to by hashes prior to their use, and they are disclosed upon activation. Benkort further explains that the community tends to mix up validators and smart contracts. 
  
Yet, he acknowledges that adopting other terms, such as “on-chain validators,” will be challenging from a marketing perspective:         In the end, ""smart contracts"" feels like an imprecise term. Rather, I'd prefer more specific terms such as ""on-chain validators"" and ""off-chain code"". I reckon this is a hard one for marketing though. Cardano rolled out the much-awaited Alonzo hard fork on Sept. 12 after stirring up controversy with its  concurrency issue . 100 smart contracts were deployed on the network within just 24 hours. 
 
Even though Cardano is late to the decentralized finance party, with Ethereum reigning supreme in the sector so far, Hoskinson  has long been dismissive  of the first-mover advantage in DeFi.",https://u.today/cardano-creator-proposes-new-term-for-smart-contracts,utoday,2021-09-19,09:10:00,en
cardano, Analysis , Ethereum killers or just pretenders? But Ether remains king for now ,"The term “Ethereum killer” is beginning to pick up the pace once again in the cryptocurrency markets as the native tokens of several competing blockchain networks are posting significant gains during September. For any alternative network to be considered as a part of this category, it needs to have one essential feature that serves as the backbone of the Ethereum network: smart contracts. Keeping this in mind, the most prominent blockchain networks by market capitalization that usually come under this purview are Cardano ( ADA ), Solana (SOL), Binance Smart Chain (BSC), Polkadot (DOT), and Terra(LUNA). The native tokens of these networks have been on an absolute tear this year. Most recently, Solana (SOL) has been in the spotlight after the bulls carrying its rally continued even in the  face of a marketwide selloff  on Sept. 8 that brought Bitcoin back below the $50,000 mark. SOL has more than doubled in price over the last 30 days but has since declined to trade around the $155 mark. The token has posted over 300% gains over the last 90 days with an extraordinary 7,871.16% gains year-to-date (YTD). In comparison, these gains dwarf ETH’s 63.77% 90-day gains and 385.36% YTD gains. Ethereum's market capitalization is currently at around $400 billion which is nearly 9 times SOL’s $47 billion market cap. Ethereum killer tokens post gains Several networks have shown promising prospects and gains. Cardano  recently completed its Alonzo hard fork  that launched Plutus-powered smart contracts on the network that would allow it to host decentralized finance (DeFi) and Web 3.0 applications. Even though its native token, ADA, showed a lackluster response to this milestone in the project’s roadmap, it has still experienced a substantial rise this year. ADA trades at around $2.40, posting 74.16% gains in the last 90 days and 1,273.86% gains YTD. Marie Tatibouet, chief marketing officer at Gate.io — a cryptocurrency exchange — outlined to Cointelegraph the twofold reasons that started the Ethereum killer movement. Speaking about the network’s lack of scalability, she said, “As things stand, Ethereum is particularly slow and can only do 15-25 transactions per second with very low throughput.” She further mentioned how high demand and low throughput lead to the next reason, bloated transaction fees that “are a bit of control.” This could go on to have an  impact on the ongoing boom  seen in the nonfungible token (NFT) market. She said, “Do you really want to pay half an ETH in gas fees just to mint a JPEG?” On this, Solana Labs spokesperson told Cointelegraph, “Minting an NFT at peak levels can be very costly. Recently, a minting fee hit 3 ETH, which is more expensive than many actual NFTs. Solana offers faster speeds and lower prices than Ethereum, which is really what it comes down to with market shares.” Another Ethereum killer prospect whose token has witnessed an outstanding performance this year is Terra. Its native token LUNA posted over 500% gains in the last 90 days and 5,477% gains YTD, and is currently trading at around $36. Such significant gains often put a token into the spotlight due to its underlying platform and technology getting more users and increasing adoption rates. Cointelegraph spoke with Lex Sokolin, global fintech co-head and head economist at ConSensys — a blockchain technology company backing Ethereum's infrastructure — who stated: “DeFi protocols are applications that grow with the number of users and capital. It is likely that DeFi will be multichain and multipurpose, though the largest amount of liquidity will remain secured by Ethereum. However, expanding and incorporating other capital sources through bridges and exchanges is a net good for the ecosystem.” Ethereum is currently in an important stage of its transformation to Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) — an entirely proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain after undergoing the London hard fork that brought in crucial updates like the EIP-1559 — the aftermath of which is still highly discussed in the cryptocurrency community. This Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) that was agreed upon by the developers, and miners entailed a change in the transaction pricing mechanism for the network. The change mainly impacted the inflation rate of the tokens and the miner’s revenues since a portion of gas fees are now being burned following the upgrade. According to  data , over 311,300 ETH tokens have been burned, with a notional value of nearly $1.1 billion. The current burn rate is 2.7 million ETH tokens per year, which would put the inflation rate at 2.3% with the issuance of 5.3 million tokens per year. Ethereum is not the only blockchain network to implement this kind of pricing mechanism, as Solana burns 50% of its transaction fees to regulate the supply of the SOL token. The Solana Labs spokesperson further said: “The Ethereum London upgrade changed miner incentives. Some believed that this would increase the MEV and there have been solutions launched to address this, but the cost of transactions on Ethereum continues to provide a barrier to entry.” On-chain data says Ethereum is still king Even though the native tokens of these “Ethereum killer” networks have posted impressive gains, a closer look at the on-chain data reveals that Ethereum’s utilization and volumes still dwarf the entirety of the remaining smart contract platform market.  Ethereum currently has a market capitalization of over $400 billion, which is significantly higher than the rest of the market. The closest network in terms of market cap is Cardano, with a $76 billion market capitalization, not even 20% as that of Ethereum.  According  to data by DappRadar, the total volume locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols built on the Ethereum blockchain is just over $100 billion. In terms of utilization, the blockchain network that ranks second is the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with a TVL of $18 billion, less than 20% of Ethereum’s TVL in DeFi.  BSC ecosystem coordinator at Binance cryptocurrency exchange Samy Karim spoke to Cointelegraph about the possibilities of Ethereum retaining its market share once the transition to Eth2 is complete: “It has to be quick, efficient and decentralized at the same time for DeFi to attain mass adoption. Ethereum is one of the first smart contract compatible chains that can leverage its pre-existing communities to grow once Eth2 is out, but it’s next to impossible to forecast its potential market share on the basis of its probable upgrade.” Currently, Ethereum leads the market in the NFT space as well with all the biggest NFT platforms, OpenSea, CryptoPunks, Axie Infinity, Rarible and Decentraland all being built on Ethereum. However, the whole NFT market has often been classified as a bubble by naysayers with the  Chinese Communist Party becoming the latest addition  when it warned the Chinese citizens about digital collectibles, and, yet, the market continues to expand. Sokolin has voiced his disagreement on this perspective, saying: “We disagree with the categorization of the NFT ecosystem as a bubble — it is a reconfiguration of digital media structure. [...] NFTs offer a different path and having a meaningful economic system is unlocking a new business model.” However, the impact of this “bubble” even going “bust” is limited for Ethereum. In Tatibouet’s opinion, “NFTs or not, Ethereum is still the market leader when it comes to smart contract platforms. The NFT market, however, has helped the competitors in gaining an advantage over their peers.” As Ethereum continues to build momentum toward its final transition to a PoS blockchain, the confidence that the financial markets are showing in its potential is slowly rising. A  report  by the British multinational bank, Standard Chartered Bank, discussed the real-world use cases of the blockchain network and accordingly  valued  ETH “structurally” between $26,000 and $35,000. As of now, ETH continues to show bullish trading patterns such as cup and handle and even has the  prospect of hitting $6,500  in the coming few months.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-killers-or-just-pretenders-ethereum-remains-king-for-now,cointelegraph,2021-09-19,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Creator Compares Burning ADA to Stealing Food,"An angry and annoyed  Charles Hoskinson  recently lashed out at one of the viewers of his ask-me-anything session who mentioned the idea of destroying part of Cardano’s supply for the sake of scarcity. 
 
Not mincing words, Hoskinson said that the proposal stemmed from the user’s “greed and stupidity”: We are so glad that you can tell us that we gotta destroy other people’s money so that you can make a little extra money and then sell the ADA and move on to something else. Hoskinson went on to compare coin burning to stealing groceries from a supermarket, taking gasoline out of other people’s cars, or grabbing someone’s wife.   
 
Cardano has a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA, which some critics believe is too high. For comparison, Bitcoin's supply is fixed at 21 million coins.  
 
As  reported by U.Today , Hoskinson recently introduced the “Proof of Burn” mechanism, which would let anyone destroy their own ADA tokens by sending them to an unspendable address. 
 
In November, the Stellar Development Foundation burned 55 billion Stellar Lumens tokens that were worth a whopping $4.7 billion at that time.

Fracada will allow turning non-fungible tokens into “fractions” with the help of the Plutus programming language. 
 
Fractionalization has become a new trend in the NFT sector since it makes it possible for those who can’t afford the whole thing to get a piece of the action. In layman’s terms, the process of breaking expensive NFTs into pieces can be compared to splitting up the equity of public companies into a huge number of shares. 
 
However, the owners of F-NFTs shouldn’t expect a return on their investment. Otherwise, token issuers could get in trouble with regulators for not complying with security laws, according to  David Carlisle of Ellipti : Fractionalization starts to raise a number of questions around things like are people participating in the purchase through fractionalization ultimately functioning like an ‘investment syndicate’ where they’re expecting a return on their investment.

Hoskinson praised Dish for being a trailblazer within their industry, describing the partnership as “super exciting” and “very challenging” at the same time. 
 
Dish’s journey doesn’t start with Cardano. The Fortune 250 company, which reported an annual revenue of $15.49 billion last year, started accepting Bitcoin all the way back in 2014. In August 2018, it also added support for Bitcoin Cash.     
 
Charlie Ergen, the co-founder of the leading satellite TV provider, said that he had been looking into leveraging blockchain for improving the company’s business.   
 
Hoskinson added that the partnership required an “enormous” amount of work: On average, when compared to where the industry’s at, I think, ultimately, that collaboration is going to be both innovative and also safe and suitable for the customers and regulators in his industry.        As  reported by U.Today , Input Output also announced that it had partnered with Chainlink to use its oracle services at the Cardano Summit 2021. 
 
On top of that, Strait Brands, an Australia-based luxury spirits company, will be using Input Output’s authentication solution Atala SCAN for managing its supply chain. 
 
In early July, the Cardano Foundation revealed that it was intending to onboard  three Fortune 500 companies  by 2024.",https://u.today/cardano-scores-partnership-with-fortune-250-company,utoday,2021-09-26,09:44:00,en

Grace, who is fluent in English and Korean, was designed by Awakening Health and SingularityNET. It can be commercially applied both in eldercare and general healthcare. Given that the eldercare robotics industry has seen a huge boost due to the pandemic, demand is not an issue. 
 
Equipped with powerful AI, Grace is capable of simulating 48 facial muscles, which allows it to have meaningful social interactions with patients. 
 
The Cardano integration will drastically enhance the robot’s performance, meaning that it will take less time to process biodata. 
 
On top of that, Cardano will make it more secure and private in order to protect medical records, according to SingularityNET CEO Ben Goertzel: In applications like that, the robot needs to deal with medical records on the back end, and it needs to deal with potentially confidential information that elderly folks and medical patients can give her on the back end…This really makes use of the security of the Cardano platform.",https://u.today/cardano-to-power-humanoid-robot-nurse-named-grace,utoday,2021-09-27,05:22:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano to enable new DeFi stablecoin with Coti ,"A new stablecoin is arriving on the Cardano blockchain to provide a tool for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations and avoid transaction fees. Cardano’s payment gateway provider, Coti, will be the official issuer of Djed, a new DeFi-focused stablecoin for the Cardano network, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson and Coti CEO Shahaf Bar-Geffen  announced  Sunday at the Cardano Summit. The new stablecoin will be based on an algorithmic design using smart contracts to ensure price stability and providing an instrument for DeFi transactions. The stablecoin is designed for paying transaction fees on the Cardano network in order to avoid “volatile and exorbitant gas fees” and make transaction costs “more predictable.” According to Djed’s research paper  released  in August, its stablecoin protocol will behave like an “autonomous bank that buys and sells stablecoins for a price in a range that is pegged to a target price.” The stablecoin will operate by maintaining a reserve of base coins while minting and burning various other stable assets and reserve coins. Related:  Cardano launches smart contracts after successful hard fork According to Hoskinson, the Djed stablecoin could be a game-changer in the crypto industry as it appeals to an “entirely new audience at a time when the industry is already experiencing astronomical growth.”  The news comes shortly after Coti  partnered  with Cardano’s stablecoin hub, Ardana, to bring decentralized stablecoin payments to AdaPay, a Cardano ( ADA ) payment gateway supporting over 30 fiat currencies.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-to-enable-new-defi-stablecoin-with-coti,cointelegraph,2021-09-27,00:00:00,en
cardano,Business,Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Donates $20M to Build Math Center at Carnegie Mellon University,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) to establish the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics. The center will be based in CMU’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences. Jeremy Avigad, a professor of philosophy and mathematical sciences at the university, will lead the center. Mathematical theorems focusing on discovering proofs, verifying steps and certifying correctness via the assistance of computers will be the center’s main area of research. The university said in a  statement  last week that the center will drive a “new way” of doing math by creating “collaborative digital libraries” for mathematical tools. CMU said it will make the technology widely accessible and advance discoveries across a broad range of disciplines, including computer science, physics and economics, among others. Hoskinson’s donation is considerably large by comparison to the seven-year median donations the university generally receives per student.  Forbes highlights  CMU’s 81st ranking as the result of “lower alumni participation numbers,” which typically receives around $9,483 per student. “I think in a very short amount of time the output of this center is going to be remarkable,” Hoskinson said during a  speech at CMU  on Thursday. “It’s going to start small, but big things do have little beginnings... later on it will grow to cover maybe another  Bourbaki-style  moment where we can cover the entire pedagogy of math and have open-source textbooks with this paradigm.” Read more:  IOHK Opens Cardano Research Lab at University of Wyoming Following $500K Donation",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/27/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-donates-20m-to-build-math-center-at-carnegie-mellon-university/,coindesk,2021-09-27,00:56:00,en

They added 3.4% of the total LINK supply to their crypto storage vaults. Santiment has spread the word that, after short-term investors began selling off their LINK holdings after the market plunged—thus, turning into ""weak hands""—cryptocurrency whales, who store from 1-10 million LINK in their wallets, took the coins off their hands last week. Overall, whales have purchased a staggering 62.02 million LINK on this market-wide dip. This is 3.4% of the total Chainlink supply and is the equivalent of $1.45 billion in fiat. ??  #Chainlink  is at a quiet $23.30, but whales have accumulated a TON of  $LINK 's supply after weak hands jumped ship following the market-wide dip. Addresses with 1M to 10M  $LINK  accumulated 62.02M coins worth $1.45B (3.4% of the total supply) last week.  https://t.co/egIlgYF77F   pic.twitter.com/7eB9eGIFXG Back in August, Santiment also noticed a trend of  whales being unwilling to hold  their LINK for a long time as they kept redistributing their supply among smaller investors. A possible reason for that was a natural market response to the coin's volatile price action. LINK reached an all-time high of $52.88 on May 10 and, since then, it managed to drop to a low of $13.97 on July 20 and has been rising again since then. On Sept. 6, LINK managed to rise to the $35.58 level but has been moving downward since. Chainlink keeps scoring new partnerships with other blockchain platforms, providing its oracles to them. Among the recent ones are official collaborations with Avalanche and  Cardano . On the latter, Chainlink oracles will be used for the creation of advanced smart contracts. Cardano announced the news on Saturday, Sept. 25, during Cardano Summit 2021. This announcement, however, does not seem to have been bullish for the LINK price; after rising to the $25.39 level on Sept. 27, LINK has been dropping.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Stablecoin launch and NFT integration back Coti’s rise to a new all-time high ,"The blockchain ecosystem has evolved significantly over the past decade as smart contract capabilities have moved the industry from being a simple medium of exchange to a bustling ecosystem full of decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFT). One project that has benefited from the increased capabilities of blockchain technology and the recent launch of smart contracts on Cardano is Coti, an enterprise-grade fintech platform focused on helping organizations create their own payment solutions and digitize any form of currency as a way to facilitate decentralized payments.  Data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  and  TradingView  shows that since bottoming out at a low of $0.0884 on July 20, the price of Coti has rallied 652% to reach a new all-time high at $0.6665 on Sept. 25 as its 24-hour trading volume surged to a record $917 million.  COTI/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingView Three reasons for the steady rally in Coti include its launch of the Djed stablecoin on the Cardano network, a series of exchange listings and the launch of Coti’s NFT game, which appears to be bringing new users to its ecosystem.  Coti launches a stablecoin on Cardano Coti recently announced that its platform would be the  official issuer of the Djed stablecoin  on the Cardano network, and the price continued its upward move on that news. Stablecoins have emerged as one of the key components of the cryptocurrency ecosystem as a whole and for DeFi, in particular, because they provide sufficient liquidity for the market and create a safe haven during times of volatility.  Aside from its DeFi applications, Djed can also be used to pay transaction fees on the Cardano network as a way to help prevent high gas fees and make the cost of conducting transactions more predictable.  New exchange listings boost trading volume A second factor behind Coti’s price growth is the token’s listing on several large exchanges, including Coinbase, the most active United States-based cryptocurrency exchange.  This announcement kicked off a series of exchange listings for Coti, including being added to Huobi, Crypto.com, the decentralized exchange 1inch, and Celsius, which is an all-in-one banking and financial services platform.  To go along with these exchange listings, the team at Coti also  revealed  that it has started the process of inviting beta testers to apply for the Coti bank account and debit card for final testing before the full launch of the protocol’s banking solution.  Related:  Coinbase users can choose to deposit paychecks directly to accounts NFT opportunities encourage invest hodling A third factor helping to boost the value and activity within the Coti ecosystem is the project’s ongoing NFT activities, including the Coti NFT Game and the network’s future plan to help support NFTs on Cardano.  NFTs have been one of the hottest sectors in the cryptocurrency ecosystem throughout 2021, and protocols that offer a lower fee environment have seen increased activity in recent months.

cardano, Analysis , Cardano’s Alonzo hard fork was a success but real utility could be a while ,"Cardano ( ADA ) reached a major milestone in its roadmap on Sep. 13 as its blockchain  launched Plutus-powered smart contracts  as a part of the Alonzo hard fork.  The Alonzo hard fork has been highly anticipated in the Cardano community as well as the cryptocurrency sphere at large. The smart contract functionality is meant to allow Cardano to become a platform on which developers can build decentralized applications (DApps) and even mint nonfungible tokens (NFTs). This milestone has been hailed as the point in the development of the network where the “mission truly begins.” However, the news of the execution of this milestone didn’t prevent the network’s native token, Cardano ( ADA ), from falling into the wider slump that has gripped the crypto market since Bitcoin ( BTC )  flashed crashed below $43,000 on Sep. 7 . In the aftermath of the Alonzo hard fork on Sep. 10, ADA dropped 10% to hit an intraday low of $2.3 while BTC and Ether ( ETH ) only fell 4% and 6.97%, respectively. Marie Tatibouet, the chief marketing officer of crypto exchange Gate.io, told Cointelegraph: “This changes everything for Cardano! For the longest time, Cardano was known as the smart contract platform without the smart contracts, but now the critics will have to change that narrative. With the advent of actual contracts, Cardano's utility and usability goes through the roof.” Cardano developer activity amongst the highest According to a  report  by Outlier Ventures titled, “Blockchain Development Trends Q2 2020/21,” Cardano is one of the most actively developed blockchains out there, with the highest average monthly commits per month on Github code repositories at 701 commits per month (CPM).  The average CPM for all protocols considered in the report is 107 CPM. These “commits” essentially represent any additions or amendments made to the network’s source code on Github. In terms of these commits, Ethereum comes in second with 447 CPM, IOTA stands third with 394 CPM with Filecoin and Flow rounding up the top five with 368 CPM and 306 CPM, respectively. This shows that Cardano is 555% more active than Ethereum and 317% than the average of all the blockchain networks connected. In terms of the total number of developers building a particular blockchain network, Ethereum is still ranked at the top with 168 monthly active developers (MAD). Cardano follows closely in second place with 165 MAD, showing a higher year-over-year increase of 31.8%. The network already has the functionality that allows the creation of NFTs. According to data provided by Cardano to Cointelegraph, there have been 780,436 NFTs minted on the network. Such an active developer community is a testament to how fast the network is developing and adapting to the changing needs of the ecosystem. Cardano has a high developer count with the highest development activities amongst similar blockchain protocols thus improving the security and transparency of the network. The Alonzo hard fork bringing in the smart contract functionality will only push these trends to greater heights. Cardano DApps are still on the distant horizon Even though the Alonzo upgrade, a part of the Goguen phase of Cardano’s roadmap, allows developers to deploy Plutus-powered smart contracts on the network, the network hasn’t quite reached that stage.  Despite the belief in the market that  over 2,000 smart contracts have been deployed  on the network, according to  data  from Vercel app, a third-party data provider that uses data from adapools.org, there are only 26 Plutus-powered smart contracts that have been deployed at the time of writing. There is also a market-wide perception that these smart contracts are in timelock. But, a spokesperson from Cardano clarified to Cointelegraph that the network has had timelock scripts since the Allegra era of the project’s roadmap. These time-locked scripts are used for activities like aiding NFT minting by making NFTs run unique for-instance and multisig schemes. Smart contracts highly differ from these scripts and cannot be placed “in timelock.” Hunain Nasser, senior analyst at OKEx Insights — the research team at cryptocurrency exchange OKEx — told Cointelegraph: “Timelocks are used to protect users from changes made to contracts after they are created. Not all 2,300 or so scripts seen on the Cardano network are actual apps, most of them are minting policies for tokens and NFTs on the Cardano network, and they are time locked to prevent changes.” However, timelocks can be used once DApps are created and widely used. They can also be used to provide users alerts once any changes to a smart contract are triggered. This feature prevents the implementation of these changes instantly, giving users time to review them and act on them if necessary before they get implemented. It remains to be seen how fast real utility could come to the Cardano network in terms of DApps and other decentralized finance features. But it also could be a case of managing expectations. Johnny Lyu, CEO of crypto exchange KuCoin, told Cointelegraph that even though the Alonzo upgrade is a landmark event for Cardano, one shouldn’t expect lightning-fast achievements in a short period of time. “Users need to be patient, and developers need to move on and do a lot of work to prevent mistakes that can lead to hacks and loss of funds on smart contracts.”  An instance of smart contracts being fast-tracked into a network can be witnessed in the case of the Binance Smart Chain, the most recent one being the  $12.7 million BTC hack from the pNetwork . Related:  DeFi hacks on Binance Smart Chain rise as TVL and volumes increase “At the same time, I believe that after launch, it will take more than two years for DApps to be deployed and operate at full scale on Cardano, as it was with the Ethereum network, “ Lyu said, adding “I think everyone is ready to start now and offer some new products and applications to users, but it is necessary to make sure that they are safe.” Since Cardano is a blockchain project that has always focused on the fundamentals, one might assume that they will allow funds to flow through smart contracts only once they are deemed safe and secure. The Founder of Five Binaries, Marek Mahut, who ran the first smart contract on Cardano said that “Safety and scalability are major features for any developer. Cardano’s accounting technology, eUTXO, provides a novel approach, which makes writing secure smart contracts easier.” The Cardano Foundation held the Cardano Summit 2021 on Sept. 25–26. IOHK, the blockchain research and development company that backs Cardano’s infrastructure, discussed the planned upgrades and improvements to the smart contract functionality at this summit. It remains to be seen when the deployment of actual DApps can be done on the network, but it’s not an instantaneous process.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-s-alonzo-hard-fork-was-a-success-but-real-utility-could-be-a-while,cointelegraph,2021-09-28,00:00:00,en

 Henry Lowenfels, the chief product officer at OneTeam Partners, who handles digital licensing for the NFL Players Association, said in an interview with GamesBeat they are hoping to  replicate  the “provenance” of NBA Top Shot with the NFL’s collectibles.  “The games are played pretty much every Sunday during the season, and these moments can be dropped at the same time and be the topic of conversation for the week,” he said. “I view this as the early innings of blockchain-based products in the same way that people were using the internet in 1993. It was mostly technologists and early adopters of the technology. People want to spend on the things they love,” he added.

cardano, Newsletter ," Finance Redefined: dYdX milestone and $1M DeFi bounty, Sept. 24–Oct. 1  ","Welcome to the latest edition of Cointelegraph’s decentralized finance (DeFi) newsletter. DYdX surpassed Coinbase in daily trading volume for the first time this week. Read on to discover why this was a seminal moment for the project’s founder. What you’re about to read is the concise version of this newsletter. For the full breakdown of DeFi’s developments over the last week — released with more anticipation than a layer-two airdrop — register below. dYdX surpasses Coinbase in trading volume for first time Decentralized derivatives exchange dYdX has risen to prominence through 2021 as an alternative to the hegemony and governmental transparency of centralized exchanges. It was revealed that dYdX  surpassed the daily trading volume  of crypto exchange stalwart Coinbase for the first time in its history. Analytical data from CoinGecko revealed that dYdX facilitated in excess of $4.3 billion trading activity on Sept. 26, eclipsing Coinbase’s output of $3.7 billion by almost 15%. This marks a full-circle moment for dYdX founder Antonio Juliano, who previously applied his trade at Coinbase. He  recalled  a time when he first spoke to CEO Brian Armstrong about his ambitions to launch a company in the future, receiving the response, “That’s awesome, let’s see how we can help you do that.” Juliano celebrated the landmark in a series of tweets last Sunday: 5 years ago I left  @coinbase  and eventually founded dYdX  Today, for the first time,  @dydxprotocol  is doing more trade volume than Coinbase   pic.twitter.com/QzoKAUpH29 — Antonio | dYdX  (@AntonioMJuliano)  September 26, 2021 
 
 Cardano to enable new DeFi stablecoin with Coti It was announced this week that Cardano’s payment gateway provider, Coti, is expected to  issue a new stablecoin called Djed  to support the ecosystem’s ambitions in ensuring price stability and increasing the transparency of gas fees on the network.  According to Djed’s research paper released in August, its stablecoin protocol will behave like an “autonomous bank that buys and sells stablecoins for a price in a range that is pegged to a target price.” The stablecoin will operate by maintaining a reserve of base coins while minting and burning various other stable assets and reserve coins. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes that the Djed stablecoin could be revolutionary for the crypto space, as it appeals to an “entirely new audience at a time when the industry is already experiencing astronomical growth.” White hat hacker paid DeFi’s largest reported bounty fee Automated market maker protocol Belt Finance offered the  largest reported bounty in the history of DeFi  this week to a white hat hacker responsible for discovering a bug that, if exploited, could have exposed $10 million in assets. For his good-willed efforts, industry programmer Alexander Schlindwein received a generous compensation of $1.05 million, $1 million of which was granted by software security platform Immunefi, while the additional $50,000 was offered by Binance Smart Chain’s Priority One program upon which Belt Finance is built. Cointelegraph spoke to Schlindwein for an exclusive insight into the timeline of events, as well as the wider implications of bounty programs on DeFi’s security landscape: “I am strongly convinced of the importance of bug bounties and initiatives such as bounty funds. Bug bounties are the last line of defense should an issue slip through the overlying layers with the potential to prevent a devastating hack while instead seriously fixing the issue and compensating the finder.” Schlindwein concluded, “It’s great to see hundreds of projects launching their bug bounty nowadays, which will certainly bring DeFi security forward in the long run.” Token performances  Analytical data reveals that DeFi’s total value locked has increased 15.34% across the week to a figure of $121.41 billion. Analytical data on  Cointelegraph Markets  and  TradingView  reveals that DeFi’s top 50 tokens by market capitalization largely struggled   across   the last seven days, with a handful of prominent exceptions.  DYDX secured the podium’s top spot with an impressive 82.39%. UNI came a respectable second with 23.88%, while PERP bagged third with 21.45%. Fourth and fifth place were claimed by FTM and XTZ with 11.62% and 8.67%, respectively.

cardano,No Section,IOHK Partners with Venture Capital Fund That Invests $6 Million to Support Cardano-Based Innovations in Africa,"A press release shared with U.Today states that IOHK, the company behind the third-largest blockchain  Cardano , is inking a partnership deal with a new VC fund in Africa. The fund plans to invest $6 million in local startups that want to build on the Cardano platform. The VC fund will select the most promising innovative blockchain projects that want to develop their  products on Cardano , thus helping to spread DLT adoption across Africa and enabling the local legacy infrastructure to get on the same level as that used by the western world. The fund, whose name the press release does not provide, is focused on blockchain companies only, since only they can give Africa innovative projects that will help its governments and companies to adopt next-gen technologies already being implemented in the West. IOG (Input Output Global), the  R&D company behind Cardano , will take part in the selection process and ensure that the companies selected will receive the funds, the necessary education and other necessary support from the aforementioned fund. IOG is already working in various parts of Africa to provide education assistance and to teach formal programming to local citizens. At the moment, IOG has a large base in Ethiopia and is working with five million students and teachers after partnering with the local government. To meet with innovators and major diplomatic figures as part of the collaboration with the fund, IOG will be organizing a tour around Africa to visit such countries as Burundi, South Africa, Kenya and Zanzibar.",https://u.today/iohk-partners-with-venture-capital-fund-that-invests-6-million-to-support-cardano-based-innovations,utoday,2021-10-01,09:10:00,en
cardano,No Section,Tax-Dodging Cardano (ADA) Traders Come Under Scrutiny in Japan,"A  recent report  by Japanese financial outlet Nikkei says that Japan’s tax collecting agencies have zeroed in on tax-dodging  cryptocurrency traders .     
 
After a large-scale audit in the Kanto region and other parts of the country, it was discovered they had failed to pay 1.4 billion yen ($12.6 million).   
 
According to a person involved in the investigation, individuals from such cities as Saitama, Tochigi, Gunma, Niigata and Nagano mainly profited off of buying and selling Cardano. Tax authorities have identified 670,000 yen ($6 million) in underreported taxes.   
 
ADA traders were either not declaring their profits or were avoiding paying taxes by means of deception.    
 
According to a tax accountant quoted by Nikkei, many people have turned a profit due to Cardano’s  rapid price surge in 2021 . 
 
Regional taxation bureaus have so far conducted six cryptocurrency-related audits. The one in the Kanto region has been monitoring ADA transactions for years, according to the report. 
 
However, with the total transaction volume reaching 5 trillion yen ($39 billion) in May, this might sound like an increasingly arduous task.",https://u.today/tax-dodging-cardano-ada-traders-come-under-scrutiny-in-japan,utoday,2021-10-03,18:22:00,en
cardano,No Section,Grayscale Outlines Cardano's Key Pros and Cons in New Report,"Leading cryptocurrency asset manager Grayscale released  a new report  about  Cardano  as part of its series of educational cryptocurrency overviews called “Building Blocks.” 
 
In the report, the investment firm has outlined the main advantages of the third-largest cryptocurrency as well as some of the major risks associated with it. 
 
Charles Hoskinson, the CEO of Input Output, is seen as the driving force behind the blockchain, with his “compelling vision” being singled out as one of Cardano’s key strengths. 
 
The Cardano Treasury, which currently boasts a war chest of $1.5 billion, is also believed to be the project’s forte. 
 
Cardano’s strong community, wide accessibility as well as decentralization, which became possible after last year’s Shelley upgrade, have also been mentioned by Grayscale as the top reasons why the blockchain is likely to succeed. 
 
As  reported by U.Today , ADA became the third-biggest holding of Grayscale's Digital Large Cap Fund in early July. When it comes to potential risks, the obvious one is cut-throat competition in the smart-contract space. Ethereum, the current leader in the sector, as well as upstarts of the likes of  Solana  and Avalanche are all vying for dominance. 
 
Despite the smart contract launch, the Cardano blockchain has seen very little utility. The Grayscale report says that it remains to be seen whether or not decentralized applications that are getting launched on the chain will see any significant adoption. 
 
The firm also believes that the Cardano blockchain may be overvalued due to its low fees: Cardano network fee revenue is still relatively low compared to other PoS blockchains like Ethereum 2.0. Unless the network can grow fees from new applications or increased usage, ADA’s valuation may not be supported based on staking cashflow utility alone. Finally, potential technical issues and the lack of regulatory clarity in the U.S. could hamper its growth.",https://u.today/grayscale-outlines-cardanos-key-pros-and-cons-in-new-report,utoday,2021-10-03,09:29:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cross-Chain Collaterals for Cardano Are Now Possible After Ardana and Elrond Partnership,"The stablecoin hub on  Cardano ,  Ardana , has secured a partnership with Elrond blockchain architecture. The native token of the  Elrond  blockchain will become one of the first cross-chain assets that will be used for collateralization on Ardana platform. Ardana will be used to bridge Cardano and Elrond. By connecting the two ecosystems, integration with a project on two chains will become possible, including token transfer between Elrond mainnet and Cardano chains. Later on, it is planned to enable cross-chain smart contract functionality. In the future, it will become possible to move assets from Cardano to Elrond by making them transferable with low fees. The native token, EGLD, will become available on  Cardano  and will be used as collateral on Ardana. Elrond is a Layer 1 blockchain network that reached carbon-negativity and low fees even in the most congested periods. The network is available to run 100,000+ transactions per second (TPS) at a $0.001 fee. Elrond's tokenomics include a limited supply and progressively decreasing issuance. EGLD token will contain a digital store of value for the next billion users and can be used as a collateral asset due to the intrinsic store of value properties. To step further and create a more convenient  blockchain  infrastructure, Elrond introduced numerous innovations: Adaptive State Sharding and secure PoS algorithm, which enable linear scalability with an efficient consensus mechanism. Ardana is a stablecoin hub that is necessary for building a DeFi foundation on the Cardano network. The stablecoin is backed by on-chain collateral and will help borrowers to take out loans by using ADA collateral or any other supported assets.",https://u.today/cross-chain-collaterals-for-cardano-are-now-possible-after-ardana-and-elrond-partnership,utoday,2021-10-07,15:01:00,en

cardano,Features,Stellar and Cardano Show the Power of College Partnerships,"Major cryptocurrency companies and foundations are partnering with educational institutions to further democratize the development of the technology and tap into new talent pools. Blockchain pioneers view it as a way of passing the torch to the next generation of innovators. Ripple’s  University Blockchain Research Initiative  (UBRI), for example, boasts partnerships with more than 30 of the world’s leading universities, while the Stellar Development Foundation (SDF) now works directly with academic programs around the world. This post is part of CoinDesk’s  universities package . “We started looking at academic institutions seriously about a year or so ago,” said Justin Rice, the vice president of ecosystem development for SDF. Rice said SDF now has enough staff to run such a program, which it sees as aligned with the open-source platform’s founding mission to increase equitable access to the world’s financial infrastructure. It’s “not only in putting the end products, the digital assets, into the hands of end users, but it’s also about empowering the people who create those products,” he said. “In many ways that’s the most important layer of the whole cake that we can and should be focusing on – the builders, the creators, the innovators – because they will take these underlying networks that represent value digitally and turn them into something meaningful.” Read more:  Do You Need to Go to College to Get a Job in Crypto?  | David Z. Morris The mandate of increasing equitable access extends to the development of the technology itself. To that end, SDF has partnered with academic programs around the world, including  Blockchain at Berkeley , the  University College London’s Centre for Blockchain Technologies ,  The National University of Singapore’s Fintech Lab  and the  University of Nicosia  in Cyprus. The first three place within the top seven places of CoinDesk’s new ranking of top universities for blockchain, which covers 230 schools worldwide. The Stellar Development Foundation also provides a range of resources to students outside of those institutional partnerships, including grants and guest lectures, as well as hackathon events developed in partnerships with blockchain clubs on campus. “We also assist in adding blockchain – and sometimes Stellar-specific – content to various curriculums,” says Rice. “A lot of it is creation of resources, some of it is providing technical assistance or providing mentorship with people in our organization, and some of it is actually creating hackathons that have rewards for successful projects.” Such partnerships are becoming increasingly popular now as a generation of blockchain pioneers feel increasingly certain about the technology’s longevity. “The people who are working on blockchain today are the first generation,” he says. “There’s been enough advancement, adoption, and mainstream understanding of blockchain where it feels like it’s here to stay, so let’s start thinking about the next generation.” These partnerships help academic institutions stay up to date with leading-edge technologies. “Having students who are trained in blockchain technology is going to inevitably lead to more tech jobs in Wyoming for our graduates,” says Dr. James Caldwell, the co-director of the University of Wyoming’s Advanced Blockchain Laboratory (WABL). The Top Universities for Blockchain by CoinDesk 2021 The Lab  launched  in early 2020 following a $500,000 endowment from IOHK, the entity behind Cardano and the ada cryptocurrency. It was also matched by state funding. The Blockchain Lab currently supports six graduate students and a similar number of undergraduate researchers. WABL has minted 205 blocks as part of the  Cardano Stake Pool . “We have students who are doing research on the cutting edge of blockchain technology, working on projects at IOHK,” said Caldwell. “Through the center’s efforts we just got 13 mining machines, and we’re starting a mining club, and we’re hoping to be able to get the students involved in keeping those machines running properly.” Caldwell, who has been teaching at the University of Wyoming for 23 years, says the state has long struggled to secure local tech jobs for its graduates, as most employers favor neighboring Colorado when setting up offices in the region. A slew of  blockchain-friendly legislative changes , coupled with WABL’s efforts, however, are helping to establish the state as the “ Crypto Capital of America .” “It provides a point of technical expertise in blockchain – and more specifically in the Cardano blockchain – in Wyoming,” he says. “Wyoming is kind of a hard sell, but now with this legislation we’ve had more technology companies interested in moving to the state than we ever have.” Caldwell adds that those recent successes are a direct result of both the legislative changes and partnership with the IOHK, and he believes it won’t be long before other states and institutions look to establish similar partnerships. “Oh gosh, I’m sure of it,” he says.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2021/10/08/stellar-and-cardano-show-the-power-of-college-partnerships/,coindesk,2021-10-08,18:16:00,en
cardano, Sponsored , Solana-built decentralized exchange uses AI to make trading more accessible ,"Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) empower users by getting cryptocurrency assets into the hands of more people. One platform is attempting to make the trading of crypto more accessible and straightforward with the use of  artificial intelligence . Currently, new users must learn about markets and the assets they want to trade, adding to the barriers of getting started. The decentralized exchange, Soldex, is eliminating these barriers by giving traders the capabilities to use AI-powered trading algorithms developed by users. Beyond its innovative AI trading capabilities, Soldex offers many additional features over other DEXs. Since it is natively built on the Solana blockchain, it resolves many of the infrastructure issues apparent in older systems. It is relatively quick and cheap to use compared to anything built on Ethereum ( ETH ).  To remain decentralized, the internal infrastructure consists of smart contracts and the use of oracles. Throughout the last decade, exchanges continued to evolve to keep pace with the development of the crypto market. The team at Soldex shares, on their platform, “you can experience real-time transactions, conveniently deposit using your exchange wallets and make light-speed swaps. It also allows investors to participate in community governance and incentivized liquidity. The latter means that users can lock their funds for a certain period of time and earn interest on the investment.” Leveraging artificial intelligence  In general, trading financial assets is a complicated task filled with mixed emotions from people. Unfortunately, emotional trading is one of the biggest mistakes people make. To remove the possibility for emotions to influence trading, artificial intelligence can eliminate the feelings and sentiments of real people and make tough decisions as they arise.  The objective of Soldex is to use a neural network algorithm to work on all market conditions. The algorithm will be able to analyze data about the market, make predictions about risks and buy and sell assets on the user’s behalf. As an automated trading suite, it will gather expert data and continue to develop its learning capabilities. More insights on  Soldex The company shares that the “AI will be so far advanced that users will be able to “create their own trading strategies and sell them on the marketplace.” Providing AI trading in a decentralized format can greatly impact the way people view cryptocurrencies. The platform is also completely permissionless, so anyone, regardless of location, can provide liquidity, trade or begin staking without a Know Your Customer (KYC) requirement.  The future of trading Taking a look at their roadmap, users can expect to see SOLX listed on major exchanges, future collaborations with the Solana foundation and a global academy AI course. This course will help explain Solana and  DeFi  to anyone new to the technology, exposing them to new knowledge and helping to build an impactful community. The platform is in the process of conducting a private sale for 30% of its tokens, which is open to retail and VC investors. SOLX will later become publicly available to users, giving them access to governance rights, feed AI bots and staked. So far, the Soldex community has grown to include over 14k+ members.

cardano,No Section,Cardano-Based Ravendex Reveals DEX Demo Prior to RAVE Private Sale,"The first Cardano-based decentralized exchange developer, RavenDex, has presented to the public the first version of the future trading platform powered by the Cardano network. The project’s $RAVE token is also built on the Cardano Network and has a total supply of one billion tokens. Token holders will be able to interact with the Cardano network, provide liquidity and earn by staking them. Currently, the project's team has announced the RAVE token private sale that is in the first stage. The first phase of the token sale will be held as a private sale for early adopters only. The sale lasted until Oct. 5. Interested investors were able to join the sale on the RavenDex website. In total, there will be five selling phases with an overall 100 million tokens available for individual investors. The seed phase will be reached once the public sale opens its way to 200 million RAVE tokens for a slightly increased price compared to the private sale. Investors will be able to purchase any amount of tokens desired before it goes public. The project's goal is to create a fully decentralized ecosystem that functions inside of a large cluster: the Cardano community. Two communities are expected to collide to place themselves inside of the cryptocurrency industry with the ability to vote on other viable projects. There are two main issues that RavenDex projects are looking forward to solving: the development of a decentralized finance system on Cardano and adding significant value to it. The first proper decentralized exchange built on Cardano will become a foundation for an extensive decentralized finance system. RAVE token will become part of the utility structure and will find its use directly inside of the project, which adds even more value to it. The Cardano ecosystem has been chosen by RavenDex as the best platform that allows cross-border transactions with low fees. But to make the Cardano ecosystem more efficient, the team will create new solutions for crypto investors that will bring the network to the next level. Creating a platform where investors will not have cross-chain transaction glitches, the RavenDex Cross-Chain Exchange and Swap Protocol has guaranteed increased trading volume and liquidity on its platform.",https://u.today/cardano-based-ravendex-reveals-dex-demo-prior-to-rave-private-sale,utoday,2021-10-11,07:00:00,en

However, Burry’s takes on various cryptocurrencies are not always correct. Back in June,  he predicted  “the mother of all crashes” and doubled down on his bearishness when Bitcoin was trading below $34,000. In the end, everyone who took Burry’s tweets seriously ended up missing out on significant gains, with Bitcoin recovering to the highest level since early May. Even though JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon is known for trashing Bitcoin since 2014, his recent comment on the flagship cryptocurrency has stirred up the Bitcoin community. During the Institute of International Finance Annual Membership meeting, Dimon  called BTC “worthless.”  It was not left unnoticed by world-famous whistleblower  Edward Snowden ; he replied with the “OK, Boomer” catchphrase known to every millennial. According to the Etherchain website, the equivalent of $1.7 billion in Ethereum  has been burned  on the Ethereum network. Previously, the same amount of funds would have been received by Ethereum miners and most likely realized on the market. The increasing number of transactions on the Ethereum network every day leads to more coins being burned than distributed, which is expected to have a positive effect on Ethereum's price.The effect has already been reflected, with Ethereum growing 26% in October. Right after the update, Ethereum grew by more than 20% but then quickly retraced back to almost 30%. After recharging his batteries during his two-week vacation in Wyoming,  Charles Hoskinson  returned to work and announced that he is preparing for the Cardano tour in Africa. Despite the doubts of the community that Hoskinson would be able to stay away from working on Cardano and posting on social media, the IOG CEO stuck to his promise and was not seen online from Sept. 30. The goal of the tour is to take part in selecting the start-ups that will receive not only the necessary financial support, the necessary education and more. Hoskinson will begin in South Africa and will then head to Egypt.

cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Trolls IMF, Says Crypto Adoption Will Save Emerging Countries from Hyperinflation","The CEO of Input Output Global and founder of the Cardano Foundation,  Charles Hoskinson , has taken to Twitter to comment on the recent warning by the International Monetary Fund against adoption of cryptocurrencies by emerging markets. On Oct. 1,  Reuters news agency  reported that the IMF warned that ""cryptoization"" of emerging countries can, in the future, undermine capital controls and, in the short term, upset financial stability in those regions. Apparently, the regulator issued the warning while responding to the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador, and other countries in Latin America considering following in its footsteps. Besides, according to the data provided by Chainlink, crypto adoption is gaining steam in such countries as India (despite the crypto ban), Pakistan and Vietnam. According to the IMF, adoption of cryptocurrencies in the third world is being driven by, among other things, unhealthy macroeconomic policies and inefficient payment systems. The regulator believes that among the factors that contribute to ""cryptoization"" in emerging countries are the low credibility of central banks among the general population and local banking systems, which are weak at the moment. Other reasons are high inflation and the lack of stability of local currencies. The IMF also stated that crypto can threaten local fiscal policy and contribute to tax evasion. The regulator then urged the governments of developing countries to consider issuing CBDCs to respond to growing crypto adoption. Thefounder of the third largest blockchain and the most popular proof-of-stake (PoS) platform,  Cardano , tweeted in response to the IMF statement. He said that crypto will save these countries from hyperinflation and highly centralized rails that the IMF and local central banks control, unlike decentralized cryptocurrencies. And by collapse, we mean they won't be laden with hyperinflation and highly centralized rails that are under our control.  https://t.co/4eUgFvtFmP   pic.twitter.com/2KvQf78yAu As reported by U.Today earlier, the famous U.S. whistleblower, who resides in Russia at the moment,  bashed central bank digital currencies  in his tweet. In particular, he focused on the digital dollar that the Fed is considering launching. Snowden referred to CBDCs as a ""perversion of crypto"" and a ""cryptofascist currency,"" since the so-called FedCoin will bring down the savings of average Americans down to zero, forcing them to spend their CBDC quickly. Besides, the Fed, Snowden said in his tweet, will have a total control of people's money, and it will be able to decide"" if and how"" they can spend it.

Her career at Ripple started back in 2017 when she was hired as the new manager of business development. Now, after more than four years with Ripple, she has parted ways with the company. Notably, former SEC boss Jay Clayton joined Fireblock as an advisor back in August. “Dogecoin Killer” Shiba Inu continues to pop up on various trading platforms around the globe. Last week, it started trading on Austrian fintech platform Bitpanda, and prior to that the meme cryptocurrency became available for trading on Coinbase Pro. Now, according to the official announcement shared on Wednesday,  ZebPay , India's oldest cryptocurrency exchange, has added support for Shiba Inu. This is not the only achievement of SHIB:  a recent poll  organized by PAC Protocol chief David Gokhshtein showed that almost 73% of respondents prefer SHIB to another Dogecoin offshoot, FLOKI. While responding to the adoption of Bitcoin by El Salvador on Oct. 1, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) warned that ""cryptoization"" of emerging countries can upset financial stability in those regions. The regulator believes that among the factors that contribute to ""cryptoization"" in emerging countries are high inflation and the lack of stability of local currencies. IOG CEO  Charles Hoskinson  commented on the recent IMF warning on Twitter, saying that crypto will save these countries from hyperinflation and highly centralized rails that the IMF and local central banks control. After China banned crypto exchanges in 2017, local cryptocurrency traders would mainly rely on over-the-counter (OTC) trading platforms amid severe regulatory scrutiny. However, residents from mainland China are now running out of options; cryptocurrency exchange Binance  will stop support  for the Chinese yuan on its OTC desk on Dec. 31 due to “regulatory requirements.” Users from mainland China will only be able to withdraw funds or close their positions. The Bitcoin price plunged to an intraday low of $54,684 on the news. CNBC has reported that, according to official data released by Cambridge University, the U.S. is now  the world’s #1 destination  for Bitcoin miners. Since last year, U.S. leadership has increased by 428%.

Yesterday, according to TradingView, the BTC/USDT trading pair  demonstrated  a major trading volume spike on OKEx. As reported by Colin Wu, the spike was caused by order fulfillment on the exchange. Traders, however, did not notice the effect from the sell order since it has not appeared on the chart because it was “eaten” by the buying power on the market. According to Santiment, Cardano traders and investors have begun to open  more long positions  as the altcoin market starts growing again and funding rates are picking up. With additional longs funded and the absence of selling pressure, the ADA price may rise further. Currently, only 61% of ADA holders remain in profit, which indicates that 40% of all holders have opened their positions for a higher price. On-chain data also suggests that more selling pressure might appear on the market once the price comes close to the previous ATH.

On Sunday, centibillionaire Elon Musk  posted a tweet , in which he referred to Dogecoin as the “people’s crypto,” since many employees of Tesla and SpaceX own it. However, Musk has failed to boost Dogecoin since the canine coin is still 63% away from its lifetime peak. His attempt to affect another meme coin turned out to be more successful: after replying to a SHIB Army member that he does not own any Shiba Inu tokens, the SHIB price tumbled 14% (quickly shrugging off Musk’s snub later on, though). According to a recent tweet by PAC CEO David Gokhshtein, canine meme coin Shiba Inu  has not been affected  by Elon Musk’s post, in which he stated that he does not hold SHIB. Even though the coin's price retraced to $0.00003472, it quickly recovered to the $0.00004 level. Gokhshtein claims that Shiba Inu reached a new all-time high without the centibillionaire pumping it. In Gokhshtein’s opinion, if Musk had tweeted about Dogecoin in the same way, it would most likely have impacted the coin negatively, hinting at at how significant the Tesla CEO’s appraisal is for Dogecoin. According to CryptoQuant data, Binance cryptocurrency exchange once again faced a  massive funds outflow  totaling 38,246 BTC. After a significant drop in the Bitcoin balance, the total balance on the sheets is close to 500,000. Previously, notable exchange inflows appeared back in May, when Bitcoin's price retraced from the previous ATH to $29,000.

The purpose of the project is to develop a blockchain-powered system aimed at monitoring students' performance in local schools. Atala Prism, which was described as ""the biggest blockchain deployment"" by Input Output, is expected to launch in early 2022. The charts recently shared by  Santiment  demonstrate that SHIB, DOGE and ELON coins are moving with a reverse correlation with the so-called ""Social Dominance"" indicator. Overall, in recent months, Shiba Inu has shown a 490% price increase, Doge is up by 28% percent in the last month and Elon Musk is showing a 889% price increase in the last month only. The main fuel for these coins is the community rather than institutional investors or use cases, so once communities ""forget"" about the coins and the indicator starts moving downwards, their price rapidly goes down and retraces back up only when whales are buying them back. But when the community picks up the hype and starts buying in, large addresses are taking profits and putting selling pressure on the asset, which leads to a rapid downward retrace.",https://u.today/musk-rejects-shib-praises-doge-40000-btc-moved-away-from-binance-cardanos-partnership-among-most,utoday,2021-10-26,15:09:00,en

cardano,No Section,How Has DeFi Changed Throughout The Last Year?,"It has become obvious that the crypto industry is in dire need of a solution that simplifies Multi-Chain trading. The complexity of Multi-Chain swaps takes too long and is far too expensive for the simple act of transferring assets and value across networks. However, the days of complicated Multi-Chain swaps are about to end, as many projects are desperately trying to come up with their own Multi-Chain solutions. Currently, swapping an ERC-20 token for a BEP-20 token is a clunky process that can be very confusing; requiring both source and target network's native assets, ultimately ending up being very expensive and time-consuming. Let’s visualize the unoptimized, run-of-the-mill version of implementing a swap across different blockchains that almost all users have had to deal with until recently:  The average person will never get past these hurdles, and it will limit the widespread adoption of DeFi. Luckily, some key projects are working on fast and easy solutions.  Rubic  is leading the pack in such Multi-Chain protocols. Rubic features a Multi-Chain Swap Protocol that enables trading across the four most demanded blockchains: Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and Avalanche, with more than 9,500 assets in total. Rubic simplifies transferring tokens across several networks. For example, swapping $LINK (ERC-20) to $CAKE (BEP-20) is easy with Rubic. This project aims at connecting, on average, one blockchain per month, with the next integration being the Moonriver parachain network. This month, the Rubic team integrated the Avalanche network into Rubic’s Multi-Chain Swap Protocol.  Rubic connected 3 major DEXs in the Avalanche ecosystem: Trader Joe, Pangolin and SushiSwap. They did this to provide the   best rates and the lowest fees for Multi-Chain Swaps on Avalanche.  In regard to the long-awaited Avalanche network integration into Rubic.exchange, the platform is offering users a Gas Refund for Multi-Chain Swap Protocol transactions of more than $200 worth of tokens within the Avalanche ecosystem. Currently, Rubic has built partnerships with $DUN, $TUN, $EXP, $CYCLE, $SING, $TSD, $AVE, $GB, $VSO, $YAK, $PNG, $MKC, $SWIFT and $JOE.  The “Gas Refund” campaign started on October 19th and will last until November 2nd.",https://u.today/how-has-defi-changed-throughout-the-last-year,utoday,2021-10-27,10:00:00,en

cardano, News , Cardano stablecoin protocol Ardana raises $10M in latest funding round ,"Ardana, a stablecoin ecosystem built on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, received $10 million in seed capital from a group of investors led by CFund, Three Arrows Capital and Ascensive Assets. Ryan Matovu, CEO and co-founder of Ardana, issued the following statement regarding the deal: “As the first all-in-one stablecoin ecosystem built on Cardano, our platform provides users with convenient access to liquidity, an ever-present concern in the hyper-competitive DeFi world. We are also able to leverage Cardano’s speed, scalability and security to offer a decentralized financial solution that works for everyone, and soon we’ll even be facilitating foreign exchange on-chain."" Users can send, receive, store, borrow and lend the stablecoin — known as dUSD — freely on the network. It will have a 1:1 exchange rate with the United States dollar, and will be fully collateralized with cryptocurrencies such as Cardano ( ADA ). Ardana plans to  hold  a public sale of its secondary token, known as DANA, for protocol governance as  outlined  in its roadmap. The project's developers intend for the sale to occur later this year, with 35.625 million out of 125 million tokens up for grabs for $0.30 to $0.60 each. The team also plans to introduce a decentralized exchange, or DEX, called Danaswap by the second quarter of next year. Ardana claims Danaswap will feature low slippage and yield farming opportunities for liquidity providers. The Cardano network currently has lower transaction fees than other networks on Ethereum, which may be advantageous for stablecoin adoption. According to Bitquery and BitInfoCharts, respectively, users  pay  an average cost of $0.43 for each Cardano transaction  compared  to $47.23 for Ethereum at time of publication.

The network  reached  the previous milestone of 1 million ADA wallets on May 22, 2021. During that period, the Cardano Foundation successfully implemented the  Alonzo hard fork , enabling smart contracts on its network. Meanwhile, Charles Hoskinson, Cardano's founder, has shifted his attention to increasing the adoption of blockchain technology in Africa. Via a tweet  posted  last week, Hoskinson claimed that 5 million students in Ethiopia are on schedule to receive digital IDs linked to their academic records that are based on the Cardano blockchain. But Cardano's technological development is also picking up pace post-Alonzo. When  asked  about the progress regarding Cardano's layer-two scaling solution, Hydra, during an ask-me-anything session on Saturday, Hoskinson said: ""We are going to keep adding resources to Hydra, and we've been trying to identify some teams so we can parallelize the workstream because it's such a high commercial priority. And it's going to be very important that we'll be able to offload a large number of the transaction traffic that's going to come from all of the apps that are coming."" Layer-two solutions operate on top of an established protocol to improve network performance. Meanwhile, sharding in the context of Cardano involves  channeling transactions off-chain to staking pools , or Hydra Nodes, without partitioning the ledger, itself. Theoretically,  suppose  each Hydra Node can process 1,000 transactions per second, and there are 1,000 such nodes. In that case, the entire Cardano network could process up to 1 million transactions per second — assuming linear scaling. The project is still undergoing research and development, with no exact launch date.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-prepares-to-scale-with-hydra-upgrade-as-network-reaches-2m-wallets,cointelegraph,2021-11-02,00:00:00,en

Yesterday, Tesla CEO Elon Musk  tweeted  that he will become the fake CEO of Dogecoin, derailing the announcement that Billy Markus, co-founder of the meme cryptocurrency, planned to make later that day. Musk then added that his Shiba Inu dog, Floki, would also be perfect for the job. Back in April 2019, the centibillionaire won a Twitter poll that enabled him to declare himself the CEO of the Dogecoin community as an April Fools' joke. As everyone can see, the joke turned out to be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Today , Billy Markus nominated Musk as a top fake Dogecoin executive. However, Musk did not receive the desired post; instead, he has become Dogecoin's fake chairman of the board. According to Shiba Inu’s Twitter account,  an Ethereum whale  has added an overwhelming 153 billion SHIB tokens ($10,982,761 in fiat equivalent) to his/her wallet, named ""Gimli."" The last time a whale purchased such a large amount of Shiba Inu meme tokens was a month ago, when the coin had an over 300% rise in a single week. As reported by U.Today, several whales have turned to Shiba Inu and have been buying large lumps of it. Their transactions carried  six trillion SHIB , 276 billion SHIB, 75 million SHIB and 28 billion SHIB. Ripple CEO  Brad Garlinghouse  was right when he called the Middle East the company's  fastest-growing region . On Nov. 1, the Saudi British Bank  launched  a USD cross-border settlement service powered by Ripple, thus extending its partnership with the fintech giant. This is the third corridor that has been opened with the help of Ripple. In 2019, the San Francisco-based company also helped Saudi British Bank to launch remittance corridors to India and Sri Lanka. According to the news by the Cardano community, the total amount of  ADA wallets  has risen to a whopping two million. As reported by U.Today earlier, the previous all-time high of one million wallets was set in late May of this year. By that time, growth had increased by nearly fivefold from the number of wallets registered on Jan. 1, when the ADA community had only 203,519 ADA. Since May, it has grown by another million wallets. As reported by Silvercast Media, a New York-based advertising company, the viral  Shiba Inu Times Square ad  was just a rendering on its Times Square billboard - it never actually happened. While other meme cryptocurrencies, such as Dogecoin and Safemoon, were indeed advertised in Times Square earlier this year, the Shiba Inu billboard is not real.

On Nov. 7, SOL’s price crossed above $262 for the first time in history, primarily owing to a market-wide price rally that saw other top cryptocurrencies ink similar gains. Meanwhile, SOL received additional bullish cues from Solana’s foray into Web 3.0 gaming development via its venture capital arm. Dubbed Solana Ventures, the firm  announced  Friday that it, alongside FTX and Lightspeed Venture Partners, would invest $100 million into the game studios and technology sector. In doing so, Solana Ventures aims to attract desktop and mobile video game developers to build their projects atop its public blockchain, thereby raising the prospect of higher SOL adoption.

Source: Solanians Telegram Channel The uptrend surfaced as speculators started treating Solana as one of the most serious challengers to Ethereum, the leading smart contracts platform  grappling with higher gas fees  and network congestion issues.  For instance, Solana  claims  that it could process 50,000–60,000 transactions per second (TPS) for an average transaction fee of $0.00025. In comparison, Ethereum transacts 15–30 TPS, with its median transaction cost ranging between $4 and $21. Smart contract platforms comparison.

If not fixed, it could raise the risks of reversed or altered transactions across the Solana network. Correction risks for SOL’s price Despite its latest rally to an all-time high, SOL risks undergoing a correction due to at least two bearish indicators.  First, SOL’s price has been forming a  rising wedge , a technical pattern that typically results in lower prices. And second, the cryptocurrency has also been confirming a bearish divergence between its rising price and declining momentum (as confirmed by lower highs on its daily relative strength index).

The native digital currency of the eponymous proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain is currently vastly outperforming the rest of the ten biggest cryptocurrencies. 
 
While Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) hit new record highs earlier today ($68,641 and $4,857, respectively), Cardano is still more than 23% away from its record peak of $3.09 that was recorded on Sept. 2. 
 
ADA showed impressive strength in early September on the cusp of its much-hyped smart contracts rollout, but its momentum started to wane shortly after the new functionality was launched. 
 
In October, Cardano lagged behind the rest of the cryptocurrency, with the Bitcoin exchange-traded fund  (ETF) debut and the Shiba Inu frenzy dominating headlines. 
 
It ended up falling below Solana (SOL), another ""Ethereum killer,"" in  early November . 
 
However, the recent price recovery allowed Cardano to surpass both Solana and Tether by market cap, but the three cryptocurrencies currently remain neck-and-neck on CoinMarketCap.",https://u.today/cardano-ends-streak-of-anemic-price-action-with-17-spike,utoday,2021-11-09,15:02:00,en

According to statistics, the number of Shiba Inu holders is approaching the  one million mark , currently counting 932,000 users. The number of people holding the tokens serve as an adoption indicator that helps predict the asset behavior on the market. Usually assets that receive more support from the community tend to become more stable on the market in both bullish and bearish periods. After sinking in “a flood of commentary” about Shiba Inu, AMC Theatres CEO Adam Aron  announced  that the movie theater giant will add the meme coin as a payment option. He said that the company is already working on figuring out how to take Shiba Inu as a currency. The other reason for adding SHIB is a whopping 81.4% of people who voted for such an initiative in a  poll  run by Aron in late October.  Previously, the movie chain confirmed that Shiba Inu’s rival, Dogecoin, would appear among the available payment options during the  first quarter of 2022 . In early October, World Mobile and IOHK  visited Zanzibar  to observe its process of its digital transformation and to discuss strategies to improve Tanzanian citizens' social development.

cardano, Sponsored , Platform aims to revolutionize the ticketing market with blockchain and NFTs ,"The music industry is dominated by scalpers who are looking for arbitrage opportunities to resell tickets. Although the phenomenon is not new, it has only become more apparent with the impact of the pandemic, making the market even more centralized than it had been previously. The sad reality is, now artists’ insiders, automated bots, partnerships with second-hand ticket retailers and those looking to make ticket resales their business have used these actions for their own personal gain. Unfortunately, many still do not recognize the impact this has on their favorite artists. The result has been that artists now have a more difficult time making a decent living. Typically an artist's album sales will go directly to their label, making them more reliant on revenue from performing live shows, which is further amplified by artists who will lose out on a good chunk of revenue from their efforts when tickets are resold. Many artists are then forced to go on excessive tours, take on unnecessary brand deals, and put themselves in other situations that may lead to burnout. Centaurify  aims to address these concerns head-on, allowing artists to take control of their independence in the music scene, eliminating the middleman and protecting their fans from exploitation. This endeavor is made possible with a solution built on the blockchain, where  nonfungible tokens  (NFTs) are used to replace each ticket sold. As traditional characteristics of this technology state, tickets become 100% traceable, impossible to counterfeit and programmable to resale conditions that can protect both the artist and their fans. This initiative is being led by 14 platinum awarded DJ, CLMD and CEO, David Rootwelt-Norberg, with the mission to empower artists and enhance the music experience through leadership and live events. Saving the music industry Centaurify is built on the Cardano ( ADA ) platform and uses its proof-of-stake ( PoS ) consensus. Doing so gives users a greener choice, along with fast transactions, low transaction fees and greater opportunity for scalability. Furthermore, since code execution becomes increasingly important, the platform leverages a programming language Haskell as the functional language to guarantee the best results for correct execution. This endeavor is done in partnership with mlabs.city, a Haskell, blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) consultancy. The Centaurify team has also had the opportunity to present their project to the public at the  Cardano Summit  at the Oslo Hub. With a strong basis, the platform then operates on three key pillars. The first one relies on each pillar ticket being minted as their own NFT, so their actions become traceable from their issuance to sale. In combination with this pillar, artists also have the opportunity to determine their own rules and values for the resale price of the ticket so no one can take advantage of their fans. More insights on  Centaurify Finally, based on the rules set upon issuance, artists can also ensure that a portion of each sale proceeds goes to the rightful owner rather than a malicious third party. Other concerns are also eliminated, such as purchasing fake tickets, which with Centaurify can become 100% traceable and impossible to counterfeit, so secondhand buyers have confidence in their purchase. When looking at the project's prospects, a member from their team shares, ""Centaurify is the future of music, a live event & music NFT universe. By tokenizing tickets with NFT & smart contract technology using the Cardano network, Centaurify will prevent scalping, fraud and control the secondary market back to the organizers & artists. We are empowering music!"" Therefore, regardless of where a ticket is sold, artists will receive a 2% inflection of value, though the number may be changed. However, it is already an improvement from the 0% currently received. A path towards adoption Met with initial success, the team has since expressed their excitement of their token launch occurring on Nov. 16, with announcements including the release of their NFT ticket platform and niched marketplace to be built following this event. In fact, by the end of Q1 2022, users expect the NFT ticketing platform to be set for real-life testing. Although Centaurify's plan is to start in the music industry, the thought of disrupting other industries, including sports and other entertainment, is not off the table.

Somebody’s criticizing us on price...I think some of these are actually bots. They can’t be real people...Or maybe they’re just crazy people. As  reported by U.Today , Solana flipped Cardano for the first time in early November.  
 
According to CoinMarketCap data, the two Ethereum killers remain neck-and-neck, with Solana stealing the show. The Cardano founder checks the price of ADA in a daily market report.       Hoskinson claims that there’s something wrong with the notion of value, pointing to the exorbitant prices of some non-fungible tokens: What about the price of ADA? What about the price of this? Why do you care? The whole definition of the value of things is up for grabs...  Echoing Twitter CEO  Jack Dorsey , he believes that the world is getting closer to hyperinflation, and everyone will be a millionaire “soon enough,” adding that the raw accumulation of money gives no meaning and purpose in life: As we get closer and closer to hyperinflation, used to be millions, then it was billions, now it's trillions.

The Cardano founder says that you can never win if you define success by price or other vanity metrics like social signals: They continue to forget that the slowest, least advanced and the first cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is still the largest and most prominent. The crypto mogul adds that he doesn’t pay much attention to criticism since he’s convinced that the best days of the Cardano ecosystem are yet to come.

cardano,No Section,Flickto (FLICK) Introduces First-Ever Media Launchpad on Cardano (ADA),"Flickto (FLICK), a novel project in the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem, attempts to democratize its fundraising method in the media segment. Introduced in Q4, 2021, the Flickto product promotes itself as a community-driven media launchpad on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. Flickto leverages the Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO) model to generate funds for its media projects. 
 
Here's everything you need to know ?  https://t.co/gaZiLwm1M1   pic.twitter.com/PK4ESR0llY Its business model allows crypto enthusiasts to vote for projects that can receive funding and earn benefits from their revenue. To secure funding for early-stage media products - films, TV Shows, Streaming Content, music albums and so on - the Flickto (FLICK) team leverages the concept of Initial Stake Pool Offering (ISPO). Flickto’s ISPOs design will have dual architecture: they will be used both for Flickto funding and to support media projects chosen by the FLICK holders community. To join the Flickto ecosystem, cryptocurrency enthusiasts should stake their Cardano (ADA) tokens in favor of Flickto staking pools. For doing so, the system will reward them with FLICK tokens in lieu of ADA rewards. Besides periodic rewards, ADA holders who support Flickto will be eligible for exclusive NFT airdrops based on the media projects utliizing the platform. For content producers, Flickto can also act as a trusted decentralized distributor. The copyright of affiliated projects will be protected by the integrity of Cardano (ADA) proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Ahead of massive announcements, award-winning artists, directors and producers have already started joining Flickto. Seasoned directors Geraint Havard Jones and Ben Morris have partnered with Flickto as launch advisors in the media industry. FLICK is the core native cryptocurrency token of Flickto and a pivotal element of its distributed tokenomics structure. It has a fixed supply of five billion FLICK; 40% of this supply is allocated for ISPO rewards, while 20% will be released on IDOs and public token sales. Fifteen percent will fuel liquidity initiatives. FLICK token will be tradeable on both centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency exchange platforms. Thus, stakers will be able to support the liquidity ecosystem of Flickto through many CEXes and DEXes. Flickto’s ISPO went live on Nov. 1, 2021, on the 300th epoch of Cardano’s staking. ISPO will be up and running initially for 32 consecutive epochs. The reward rate is high: every 1 ADA locked in favor of Flickto is rewarded with 0.15 FLICK per Cardano (ADA) epoch. The minimum amount of ADA staked to be eligible for FLICK rewards is capped at 10 tokens. The secondary ISPO phase will start in April 2022. The exact time period for the public sale and IDO will be unveiled soon.",https://u.today/flickto-flick-introduces-first-ever-media-launchpad-on-cardano-ada,utoday,2021-11-15,11:15:00,en

In addition, wallets will be effectively in withdraw-only mode until the first quarter of 2022, when selling will also become limited. In making the decision, eToro cited regulatory concerns surrounding both assets. The move came as a surprise to some as ADA has not been traditionally associated with regulatory troubles. In context, tokens like Ripple ( XRP ), whose creators are currently engaged in an  ongoing lawsuit with the Securities and Exchange Commission , or SEC, as well as  Monero, which is a privacy coin  that some fear is easily abused for illicit purposes, are facing the brunt of regulatory scrutiny in the cryptocurrency industry.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Down 50% from Peak: Possible Reasons,"ADA, a core native asset of the newest smart contracts platform Cardano, touched $1.5 in its multi-month freefall. Here's what makes it plummet before gaining 200% in five weeks. On Sept. 2, 2021, the ADA price reached its all-time high at $3.10 on the eve of the activation of its smart contract functionality. This major upgrade went live as a result of Alonzo hard-fork mainnet activation in mid-September. At the same time, its activation failed to catalyze another wave of ADA price rally: the asset entered a multi-week ""bear market."" On Nov. 26, 2021, it reached the lowest level since Aug. 9. The most obvious mid-term catalyst is the criticism of Cardano's smart contracts performance. As covered by U.Today previously, the viability, speed and functionality of this system were attacked by both Ethereum (ETH) and Bitcoin (BTC) maximalists. In terms of short-term bearish catalysts, the most obvious one is the delisting of Cardano's ADA by eToro, a mainstream derivatives trading platform. eToro restricted its U.S. customers from opening positions in ADA and Tron's Tronics (TRX) from Dec. 26, 2021. Cardano's inventor, Charles Hoskinson, has already slammed eToro's decision and attributed it to the lack of a global regulatory standard in the sphere of crypto and blockchain. As U.Today reported earlier, Mr. Hoskinson is certain that 2022 will be a splendid year for his ecosystem. Speaking about its roadmap for the coming year, he called it a ""living ecosystem."" He calls Cardano's technology unbelievable and claims it is able to fuel ""thousands"" of products by ""so many great innovations.""",https://u.today/cardano-ada-down-50-from-peak-possible-reasons,utoday,2021-11-27,15:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Newegg Will Accept SHIB, Cardano Down 50% from Its Peak, Musk Warns DOGE Holders Against Leveraged Trading: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","The past weekend was rich with significant events in the crypto industry. Take a look at U.Today’s summary of the top five news stories. According to Saturday’s post on  Newegg’s  official Twitter page, Shiba Inu supporters can start celebrating since their favorite meme-coin will be accepted by the electronics retailer. The day before the announcement, Shiba Inu’s official Twitter account  teased  its followers by posting a cryptic tweet with an egg emoji and the #friendshib hashtag. In April, Newegg also added  Dogecoin , the original meme coin. As of now, it remains unknown when exactly Shiba Inu will appear on the list of payment options. After reaching its all-time high of $3.10 in early September, ADA cannot currently pride itself on its price movements, touching $1.50 on Saturday. The experts outline  two possible reasons  for that. The first one is a criticism of Cardano's smart contracts performance by both ETH and BTC maximalists, with the second reason being the delisting of Cardano's ADA by eToro, a mainstream derivatives trading platform. Despite all this, Cardano's inventor  Charles Hoskinson  is certain that 2022 will be a splendid year for his ecosystem. Last weekend, famous centibillionaire  Elon Musk  showed support for a tweet posted by Twitter user Mishaboar. In his post, Mishaboar wrote that some Dogecoin holders started asking for help after their margin accounts were liquidated and stressed the importance of educating people about highly risky leveraged trading. He added that only seasoned traders could try their hand at margin trading, noting that the cryptocurrency market is largely unregulated. According to  Kimbal Musk , restaurateur, chef, entrepreneur and Elon Musk’s brother, Web3's ideology and methods can be very useful in philanthropy. He believes that Web3 deployment in charity could unlock 12-digit funds for the philanthropy industry and also advance its efficiency by eliminating bureaucracy and corruption from this sphere. Kimbal Musk’s statement was widely supported by his followers. According to the latest on-chain data, an anonymous wallet  has purchased  an eye-popping 35 billion Shiba Inu tokens. Despite whales buying large amounts of SHIB, the market does not seem to be reacting in any way. The volatility of SHIB token remains low as both buying and selling pressure are reduced, according to the volume indicator. Currently, whale holding has increased back to pre-correction levels with approximately $1 billion worth of holdings remaining on whale-tier wallets, as of Nov. 27.",https://u.today/newegg-will-accept-shib-cardano-down-50-from-its-peak-musk-warns-doge-holders-against-leveraged,utoday,2021-11-29,15:02:00,en
cardano, News ," MELD’s $1B ISPO highlights emerging use cases for Cardano, crypto fundraising ","DeFi banking protocol MELD recently made headlines for attracting more than $1 billion worth of staked Cardano ( ADA ) to its protocol through a novel funding mechanism called an initial stake pool offering, or ISPO, marking an important innovation in how early adopters support blockchain startups. Cointelegraph had the opportunity to connect with MELD CEO Ken Olling to discuss the significance of the ISPO as well as Cardano’s role in facilitating widescale participation in the stake pools.  ISPO: An overview The ISPO is a novel way for investors and other early adopters to support a project by delegating cryptocurrency to public stake pools to earn project-specific tokens. MELD is currently the only known project to employ an ISPO even though the concept had been previously proposed elsewhere.  The MELD ISPO, which was initiated on July 1, allowed Cardano holders to stake their ADA for any duration and quantity in order to receive MELD tokens. The first stake pool was filled within 24 hours after roughly $100 million worth of ADA was contributed. Within five days, four stake pools equivalent to nearly $200 million were filled. MELD stopped accepting new delegations on Oct. 27. By that time, nearly 620 million ADA had been staked for a cumulative value of over $1 billion. All said, the ISPO had over 40,000 participants. MELD also raked in $10 million in revenue.  The ISPO  was  a significant departure from previous crypto funding initiatives, most notably the  initial coin offering  (ICO) and security token offering (STO), and was a nod to  Cardano’s growing ecosystem . It also highlighted pent-up demand in the market for DeFi projects, which continue to pique investors’ interest.  Blockchain projects raised billions of dollars in funding in 2017 and 2018 before regulatory crackdowns and a brutal crypto bear market put an end to the mania. Source: 3TS Capital Why Cardano? Of all the proof-of-stake (PoS) chains in existence, MELD selected Cardano for its ISPO for its lower transaction costs, attractive staking mechanism and overall architecture, according to CEO Ken Olling. During MELD’s initial development phase in mid-2020, Cardano was perceived to be the best option considering the circumstances surrounding Ethereum ( ETH ) at the time.  “There aren’t any more established blockchains,” Olling told Cointelegraph, adding:  “One of our requirements was a modern PoS blockchain. The only real option at the time was Cardano. You have Solana, which has a two-tiered, much more complex staking mechanic in regards to the blockchain. It also operates legally in a different way. And then you have other PoS blockchains, but none of them really provided the full picture or the full package.” Related:  How Solana and Cardano are paving new avenues for NFT growth Olling said his firm is still “very  bullish” about Cardano’s future despite its recent struggles . ADA's performance has lagged considerably in recent months after being one of the crypto market's hottest performers through September. Achieving financial efficiency At its core, MELD offers non-custodial banking services, enabling users to lend and borrow with both crypto and fiat currencies as well as stake their MELD tokens for interest. Lenders can deposit both cryptocurrency and fiat currency on the platform. Borrowers have the ability to borrow in both types of assets after posting their crypto as collateral.  The crypto collateral option is attractive for investors because it means they can borrow fiat to meet their expenses without having to sell their digital assets and thus incur a capital gains penalty. ( Capital gains taxes  are a source of consternation for cryptocurrency investors, with large bag holders always looking for ways to use their newfound wealth in the most efficient way possible.) When asked about what  differentiates  MELD from other crypto lending and borrowing platforms, Olling identified two factors: first, “on the highest level, we offer transparency,” he said. “It’s on the blockchain, so what happens with funds on the protocol is completely open-sourced, unlike centralized crypto lending and borrowing services.” Secondly, and on a more practical level, MELD offers “users fiat currencies for their crypto-backed loans, whereas other [...] DeFi competitors can only offer other cryptocurrencies.”  Related:  DeFi can be 100 times larger than today in 5 years Cryptocurrency lending has emerged as one of the biggest use cases within DeFi, with the likes of Aave and Compound achieving over $14 billion and $11 billion in total value locked (TVL), respectively. More than two-dozen other protocols have  achieved  a TVL of at least $100 million, according to industry data.  Although the emergence of DeFi has presented a sort of threat to the traditional financial system, the industry's growth has been largely driven by users who already have  access to legacy banking systems . That appears to be slowly changing as crypto entrepreneurs target the globe's vast unbanked and underbanked populations in pursuit of financial inclusion. According to Olling, financial inclusion is a by-product of a more efficient financial system that is made possible through DeFi.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/meld-s-1b-ispo-highlights-emerging-use-cases-for-cardano-crypto-fundraising,cointelegraph,2021-11-29,00:00:00,en

At the same time, when the prices for consumers go up, politicians refuse to admit that this process is catalyzed by never-ending QE policy in most countries. Instead of doing so, they blame corporations: Mr. Hoskinson refers to recent statements by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) who repeatedly accuses the U.S. corporations of greed.

MonoX Finance, a blockchain firm, said on Wednesday that a hacker stole $31 million by leveraging a bug in the software it uses to generate smart contracts.

Stay updated on recent crypto events! According to CoinMarketCap,  yesterday , Terra’s native staking token, LUNA, managed to reach a new ATH of $64.87. This price surge has led to LUNA’s market cap surpassing $25 billion, making it worth more than that of Shiba Inu. The two tokens are in 11th and 13th places, respectively, on CoinMarketCap. At the moment, LUNA is changing hands at $67.30. Louis Navellier , Navellier & Associates founder, claims that Bitcoin might face an 80% correction. According to a famous money manager, the main hurdle for BTC would be the U.S. Federal Reserve's  tapering  off of its bond purchase program. Over the past two weeks, Bitcoin has been range-bound, failing to gain traction over the $59,000 resistance level seven times. If the flagship crypto continues sliding lower, Navellier believes that it could end by forming a scary double-top pattern. This would not be new for Bitcoin: in December 2018, it recorded an 84.5% correction from its previous bull market peak of roughly $20,000. Yesterday, an anonymous whale  moved  150 million XRP coins worth approximately $150 million from Binance exchange to an unknown wallet that is currently holding 150 million coins. This is the first large transaction made by this wallet - previously, its transactions were worth about $20-$30.

cardano, News , Blockchain folk hero Nandy Martin hopes to build a better community for Haitians in Miami   ,"Haiti, a Western Caribbean country torn by a tragic past, natural disasters, poor leadership and ineffective foreign aid, is not a country that comes to people's minds when they think of blockchain adoption. For years, Haiti has been among the world's poorest countries in terms of GDP per capita, as per data from the World Bank. But Haitian-Canadian entrepreneur Nandy Martin, colloquially known as Captain Haiti for wandering the streets of his community in his superhero attire and signature shield prop, has ambitious goals to change that. Operating from the sunny domains of his humble abode in Miami's Little Haiti, Martin launched the Little Haiti Coin on the  Cardano blockchain  as an initiative to clean up his community, drive business crypto adoption and use it as a means to promote Haitian imports. In an exclusive interview with Cointelegraph, Captain Haiti discussed the dynamics of the Little Haitian Coin and the technological roadmap of the project going forward. Captain Haiti and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  | Source:   Charles Hoskinson via Twitter Cointelegraph:  What inspired you to create the Little Haiti Coin and this venture? Captain Haiti:  There are so many nonprofits involved in Haitian society. For the last, I will say, minimum 60 to 70 years, and the situation has gotten worse despite their best efforts. So, my approach to the country is totally capitalist, by integrating it into the world's economic system. And that's why I've created the Little Haiti coin, to allow folks there to get into the crypto era. So, the goods that we have and the precious minerals we have in Haiti could have a vehicle to trade them to the world, take care of our people with our social programs, etc. CT:  How are you turning that vision into reality? CH:  We have created 1 million Little Haiti Coin on the Cardano blockchain. The way that we are doing it, we have acquired a facility and partnership for a 5000 square feet facility in Little Haiti, so its residents can come and install a wallet where they're going to receive one Little Haiti Coin. So the goal of the facility is to get the people to install the wallet and allow them to go and purchase products or goods in Little Haiti that are coming from Haiti. So, the utility of the token is to provide the resident of Little Haiti and provide the world a discount from 10% to 100% of goods imported from Haiti. CT:  So how much remittance is coming from Haiti into the Little Haiti community in Miami? CH:  Our goal is to capture one-quarter of the remittance from Haitians worldwide to Haiti, or $1 billion. That's a great question. Because the remittance to Haiti represents 36% of Haiti's GDP. And the first phase was to get vendors in local businesses to have the Little Haiti Coin — to want to accept that [and be] in our ad. And to do that, we approached the Commissioner of Miami District 5, Jeffrey Watson. And he had granted $200,000 to 40 local businesses to help import Haitian products and make them available to tourists visiting Little Haiti. CT:  What does progress look like for the Little Haiti Coin? CH:  The first utility of the new Haiti coin was to clean up the neighborhood. Okay, because it is an area that is economically challenged. So you do have a lot of littering. We work in partnership with the City of Miami, where anybody could sponsor to clean up one square foot of Little Haiti with $3. And what you receive ... [as a] reward is one Little Haiti coin. So doing so, we had cleaned up over 300,000 square feet of Haiti. CT:  So, out of all blockchains, why did you choose Cardano, specifically, to launch the Little Haiti coin? CH:  After meeting Charles Hoskinson, at that instant, I knew that somebody that is so innovative, and somebody that has been in this world, and descriptor world for that long, for that person to be so humble, and also willing to participate and play around with the shield, etc., ... So, I had to dig into Cardano. And then I've discovered Cardano's mission to help create a better world for big organizations like the small ones and people like me. So, I felt that I had a home in Cardano for the Little Haiti Coin. CT:  Where do you see the technology heading one or two years from now? CH:  Yes, the project is going fast. The first thing is, I've created the Captain Haiti gaming token on the Binance Chain to educate the world about crypto. We will be releasing it on January 1. We already  have  10,000 downloads of the game on the Play Store. Screenshot of Captain Haiti game  |  Source: Captain Haiti And all we have to do is to get the kids to play. And as the kids are playing, we are burning the circulating supply. This brings in questions, ""Hey, what is circulating supply? What is inflation? What is deflation?"" It's also about educating and changing the perception of people about Haiti. And then, [we] also have the Cardano Beach facility. So, we provide you [with] an NFT that gets like the deed of your square footage that you're renting, for, say, a co-working space. And once we have the hub, we invite the whole population to create their Cardano ID right here in Little Haiti.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-folk-hero-nandy-martin-hopes-to-build-a-better-community-for-haitians-in-miami,cointelegraph,2021-12-10,00:00:00,en

Unsurprisingly,  Bitcoin  is at the top of the list, with 38% of the survey participants recognizing the crypto king. Ethereum, Binance Coin and Dogecoin are also in the top five, ahead of Shiba Inu. 
 
Only a minuscule 1% of Aussies have a handle on what Avalanche actually is.

The canine token stole the spotlight earlier this year because of its remarkable price performance that blew all other cryptocurrencies out of the water. 
 
The meme coin mania is, of course, not limited to Australia. In May, Harris Poll's survey found that Dogecoin was more popular than Ethereum with American investors. Only 11% of Aussies say that they ""fully"" understand what cryptocurrency is. However, an impressive 42% of respondents claim that they would use cryptocurrencies if they were to become legal tender in the country. The majority of them would either use crypto for savings or make purchases with it (34% and 23%, respectively). 
   
Twenty-five percent of Australians agree that crypto should be recognized as an official currency in the country. 
 
El Salvador made a trailblazing move by making Bitcoin a legal tender this year, but others are yet to follow. 
 
As  reported by U.Today , Treasurer Josh Frydenberg announced a plan to overhaul Australia's existing payment system in order not to lag behind Silicon Valley. The Australian government will be assessing the creation of a central bank digital currency while working on a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies.",https://u.today/shiba-inu-is-more-popular-than-xrp-and-cardano-in-australia,utoday,2021-12-13,16:01:00,en
cardano,No Section,World's First Bitcoin ETF in Canada Buys Another $211.6 Million in BTC,"Chinese blockchain journalist and blogger Colin Wu has tweeted that Purpose Bitcoin ETF, the first institution of its kind in the country and in the world that was approved by regulators, has added 4,342  Bitcoins  to its stash, now holding almost 29,000 BTC. Wu has tweeted that, in the first two weeks of December, Purpose Bitcoin ETF, acquired 4,342 Bitcoins, adding it to its  BTC stash . This amount of crypto totals $211,646,014 at the current Bitcoin exchange rate. The overall amount of Bitcoin held by the fund is now equal to a whopping 28,974 BTC—$1,411,688,612, compared to the 24,632 it held before December. Thus, Purpose Bitcoin ETF has bought more BTC, while the world's flagship cryptocurrency is trading below $50,000 this month. According to Glassnode, in December, the number of bitcoins held by Purpose Bitcoin ETF has increased significantly, from 24,632 to 28,974, an increase of approximately 4,342 bitcoins.

That happened for the first time in almost half a year, signaling ""extreme fear"" on the market. Analysts believe that this sharp fall took place due to Bitcoin's failure to stay above the $50,000 price line.

According to a press release shared with U.Today, AdaSwap, a noncustodial cryptocurrency exchange on Cardano (ADA) blockchain, announces its first token sale. AdaSwap's core native utility asset, ASW, will be released to the public on CardStarter, the most popular Cardano-centric launchpad for initial decentralized exchange offerings (IDOs). For this token sale, AdaSwap is allocating 80 million tokens. The initial token sale price is set at $0.005. Thus, the hardcap for the IDO is limited at $400,000. This allocation will be unlocked in two batches: the first portion of tokens will be released immediately upon TGE, while the remaining 50% will be transferred to investors within 30 days. Itay Levy, CEO of AdaSwap, stresses the crucial importance of this milestone for the progress of his product: A launchpad is a very important starting point for the lifecycle of any project, it establishes the base for which strong beams must be built upon. At AdaSwap, we have chosen the best launchpad for the strongest of bases. We are really excited to be working with CardStarter in order to bring AdaSwap to the world! Brandon Kazakoff, COO of Cardstarter, is sure that AdaSwap's IDO is a pivotal moment for the entire DeFi ecosystem of Cardano (ADA): In order for the potential of the Cardano ecosystem to be realized, concrete realities must be brought into alignment with the Cardano ethos. It is incumbent on all those who share this ethos to extend our support to the builders, creators, and projects working to lay down the infrastructure of decentralized finance on Cardano. I believe that ADAswap has an important role to play in this regard. The ecosystem is rapidly taking shape, and I am more confident than ever that the future of DeFi is bright, close at hand, and built on Cardano. AdaSwap is a holistic decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem on Cardano (ADA). Besides seamlessly swapping Cardano-based tokens, it allows clients to provide liquidity to Cardano-centric pools and to trade on an NFT marketplace. ASW token is also a native Cardano asset, so it can be exchanged on AdaSwap for any other asset issued on this blockchain.",https://u.today/adaswap-launches-gamified-dex-on-cardano-teases-token-sale,utoday,2021-12-14,15:17:00,en
cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano’s ADA price eyes 30% rally with a potential ‘triple bottom’ setup ,"Cardano ( ADA ) may rally by nearly 30% in the coming days as it forms a classic bullish reversal pattern. Sharp ADA rebound underway Dubbed “ triple bottom ,” the pattern typically occurs at the end of a downtrend and consists of three consecutive lows printed roughly atop the same level. This means triple bottoms indicate sellers’ inability to break below a specific support level on three back-to-back attempts, which ultimately paves the way for buyers to take over. In a perfect scenario, the return of buyers to the market allows the instrument to retrace sharply toward a higher level, called the “neckline,” that connects the highs of the previous two rebounds. The move follows up with another breakout, this time taking the price higher by as much as the distance between the pattern’s bottom and neckline. So far,  ADA’s price  has been able to paint the triple bottom halfway, now rebounding after forming the third low, as shown in the chart below. ADA/USD 4-hour price chart featuring triple-bottom setup. Source: TradingView The point at which ADA’s price reversed was accompanied by a rise in trading volume, suggesting that the rebound had enough backing from buyers. Therefore,  Cardano’s token  looks poised to at least pursue a run-up toward $1.40. Moreover, if the price further breaks above the neckline level decisively, it will likely continue to rally until it hits $1.63 — as per the triple bottom scenario. Accumulation area The potential triple bottom scenario emerged after ADA’s price  plunged by more than 60%  from its record high of $3.16 achieved on Sept. 2 earlier this year. It also surfaced as the Cardano token became one of the worst performers quarter-to-date, dropping nearly 45.50% compared to its top rival Ether’s ( ETH ) 15% gains. ADA’s multi-month selloff pushed its daily relative strength index (RSI), a momentum indicator, into oversold territory. In addition, ADA’s price drop also led it to what appears like a dependable “ accumulation area ,” as shown in the chart below.  ADA/USD daily price chart featuring accumulation area and oversold RSI. Source: TradingView Both RSI and the accumulation area also point to a buying scenario in the ADA market, thus supporting the triple bottom scenario on the four-hour chart. Risks remain for ADA’s price It is important to notice that ADA dropped by more than 5.50% in the past 24 hours, much in sync with other top crypto assets in the space, with Bitcoin ( BTC ) sinking by over 3% and Ether by almost 5% in the same period. At the core of the crypto market’s uniformed decline was the United States Federal Reserve’s two-day policy meeting starting Tuesday. In the meetup, the U.S. central bank will likely decide to accelerate the  tapering of its $120-billion-a-month asset-purchasing program , one of the key catalysts behind the crypto and stock market rally since March 2020. Other parts of the Fed meeting will see the officials discussing the prospects of rate increases next year from its current near-zero levels. Cheaper lending had also played an important role in pushing the Bitcoin and  altcoin market prices higher  across 2020 and 2021, including ADA. Related:  Bitcoin price dip may end Wednesday as Bitfinex bids hint at Fed ‘buy the news’ plans As Fed officials initiate their policy meeting, ADA is testing $1.18 as its weekly support for a potential price rebound.

cardano, Sponsored , New platform aims to disrupt media production funding ,"Today, the future of content production is ripe for disruption. With advances in technology and the rise of a generation of influencers, the skills of content production have been adopted en masse. Individuals and groups are now producing valuable streams of all forms of content across multiple channels, including YouTube, Instagram, Twitch and lesser-known distribution channels. This has seen a devaluing of the content itself. Although the creator is putting a lot of time and effort into the production process, it is often the case that the commercial return does not reflect this effort. How do we ensure that the creator and audience engaging with relevant forms of content are rewarded for their time?  As demand for more professionally produced content grows,  the rewards  for the producers must also change and grow.  Empowering content creators With increased innovation and the surge of interest in decentralized decision-making, media content curation is slowly being handed back to the public. The Flickto platform sees this as a key opportunity to add more diverse streams of content and help to fund the smaller creators that are currently being locked out of the bigger picture. With new ways to fund the creation and distribution of content, there are new opportunities to effectively reward the creative economy. Content collaboration as a key component of future content Many creators that wish to produce successful series or the next box office hit stumble upon finance blockades in each step of the process. With the rise of streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon, the cost of production and budgets required for high-quality content has soared. According to  Variety Magazine , heavyweights like Stranger Things cost an estimated $6 million an episode, and Netflix's period drama The Crown cost an estimated $10 million an episode. For modest creators just starting out in their production journey, these figures can seem overwhelming.  The FlickTo platform is allowing users to get involved in the creative process, taking advantage of the  DAO mentality  whereby you see decision-making and choice spread amongst the community. Furthermore, the community is rewarded for collaboration after participating through staking as a way to utilize existing DeFi services within a creative setting.  Unique ways to raise funds for media projects  Unique staking mechanisms via Cardano ( ADA ) will allow media producers to raise extra funds and allocate finance to various projects. Funding for great media projects should not be heavily reliant on a few key financial backers. Flickto also aims to give users a stake in the content creation process and get involved in the financial opportunities arising from a successful media project.  ""It's time to change how media projects are financed. Flickto is the first Cardano-based media project launchpad, funding the next generation of Film, TV and Streaming content creators,"" the team shares. More insights from Flickto  here To solve the barriers to entry that currently exist with some of the bigger media streaming platforms, Flickto aims to support the financing of media production from the ground up with various DeFi services and backing projects from storyboard stage to production to talent support and distribution. Established director Ben Morris who has directed British hits such as Holby City and producer Geraint Havard Jones who has produced Keeping Faith, have partnered with the platform to provide unique insights into the media industry. To date, they have over 4.3 million ADA staked in their Cardano stake pool, demonstrating a clear commitment to the project from the DeFi community.  Learn more about  Flickto Disclaimer.

cardano, News , Genius Yield's ISPO pools surpass $118M within first 48 hours  ,"On Dec. 15, Genius Yield, a decentralized automated market maker and liquidity management protocol built on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain, announced the launch of its initial stake pool offering, or ISPO. The process will continue for six months until June 15, 2022. At the time of publication, more than 95.8 million ADA, worth approximately $118 million at the time of writing, have been  delegated  to the stake pools.  In an ISPO, blockchain enthusiasts delegate their cryptos in a protocol and receive tokens of the new project they fund as rewards, instead of receiving regular ADA staking rewards, which goes to the developers. Investors can reclaim their staked cryptos at any period. By utilizing this method, investors not only harvest yields, but keep their initial investments secure as pool operators do not possess control over delegated funds.  In this particular ISPO, users delegate their ADA from their Cardano wallet, such as Yoroi, into one of the four GENS stake pools and receive the GENS token. Funds do not leave the delegator's wallet. According to Genius Yield developers, 10 million GENS tokens out of a total supply of 100 million will be distributed to ISPO investors. In addition, they will also receive 20% of transaction fees on the platform. Related:  MELD’s $1B ISPO highlights emerging use cases for Cardano, crypto fundraising The funds, in the form of ADA staking rewards going to developers, will be used in part to build a solution that enables users to benefit from advanced algorithmic trading strategies and yield optimization on the Genius Yield platform.

cardano, Sponsored , Decentralized firm collaborates with NFT designer to provide events ticketing solution ,"Events and concerts are sucking artists and organizers dry through an archaic and ineffective ticketing system. This inflexive system is dominated by three players hogging up to 80% of the generated revenue. Its failure to evolve with the times has created loopholes for unscrupulous individuals to exploit artists and organizers. First off, it has enabled the emergence of an uncontrolled secondary market. Here, bad actors make a killing reselling tickets exorbitantly to clueless fans, and obviously, they don't share profits with the creators and planners. Further, the inefficiencies of the current ticketing systems have given rise to scalping. Unethical parties use bots to get unauthorized access to concert and event tickets. They then print these and distribute them before the real tickets hit the market. The result is that artists and events companies lose out on revenue due to them while fans overpay for tickets. That has to stop, and  Centaurify , a decentralized NFT ticketing firm, has devised a solution. Getting to know Centuarify Centaurify is developing a decentralized  NFT ticketing  system and an NFT marketplace for musicians to sell merchandise. These are the first steps in Centaurify’s plan to create a music universe powered by blockchain, empowering musicians and bringing them closer to fans. The collaboration with Impossible Brief, an NFT creative agency that works with the most recognizable names in sports and entertainment, will add a new level to ticket design, giving fans a unique third ticket design that will become collectibles in the future. Impossible Brief’s clients include Snoop Dogg, Lionel Messi, Patrick Mahomes, Alex Ovechkin and Fernando Tatis Jnr. It has also done cover art for the Chainsmokers and To Him. Centaurify and Impossible Brief see their partnership taking event ticketing to the next level. According to the Centaurify team, the ""Centaurify and Impossible Brief partnership is changing the game regarding NFT ticketing."" More insights from  Centaurify Centaurify is developing the NFT ticketing and marketplace platforms to be cross-chain and multichain interoperable, making the platforms more accessible and future-proofed. Centaurify is currently developing on Cardano ( ADA ), Solana ( SOL ) and Ethereum ( ETH ). It's planning to onboard other networks as it develops, such as Polygon ( MATIC ). They will be utilizing blockchain and  NFT technology  to provide 100% traceability of tickets, removing fake tickets from the secondary market and reducing the impact of scalping through the use of smart contracts. These features enable artists and event planners to set ticketing rules. They also eliminate intermediaries, leaving the organization and facilitation of events firmly in the hands of artists and event planners. Finally, the solution plans to enhance the user experience. Centaurify sees its relationship with Impossible Brief as having a huge potential in tickets that will help bring fans and artists together, providing ticket holders with unique experiences before and after the event. The Utility of CENT Centaurify's first and secondary marketplace for NFT tickets will support creatives selling NFTs and collectibles. The platform has a utility cryptocurrency, CENT, an ERC-20 token. Centaurify intends to bridge the token to Cardano, Solana and Polkadot ( DOT ) as a part of their multiple chain solution. Users can earn incentives for holding and staking CENT. The more users stake, the more access they will have to the different tiers of VIP early access and rewards. Both users and artists are eligible for staking rewards. The users will collectively attract 1-3% reward from every NFT ticket bought, while artists can dictate the percent of rewards they get from the sale of tickets and NFTs in both markets. Achievements and plans It's been a busy twelve months for Centaurify. The highlight has been its successful initial DEX offering (IDO), according to the team. The final product’s launch is scheduled for the end of Q2. The company also expanded its presence in Europe. It has opened new offices in Norway and Estonia, enhancing its visibility across the EU zone. Centaurify is looking to grow its team in the future and aims to partner with leading musicians, festivals and event planners, along with adding more blockchain platforms and fully deploying the NFT tickets solution.

Earlier in March, Cardano announced the Mary hard fork which brought in the availability of native tokens and a multi-asset ledger. Launched in September 2021, the Alonzo hard fork brought programmability to Cardano. It also enabled the creation and deployment of Plutus-powered smart contracts, ushering in the Basho epoch. These developments led to rapid network growth as community aggregators of Cardano projects estimate there are now about 274 projects in development or actively running on the network. Transactions also exceeded 23 million in December, it states. Additionally, Cardano now has over 2.5 million native assets, with more than two million of these being non-fungible tokens (NFTs). The In/Out of the Money series of indicators from  IntoTheBlock  analytics group shows addresses and volume for a crypto asset based on their profits. These addresses are then separated into clusters to identify large buying zones based on blockchain data that are expected to act as price support or resistance. As per In/Out of the Money, Cardano faces a sell wall at the $1.46 -$1.63 range above where it trades presently. A massive sell order, or collection of sell orders, is placed from the $1.46 level up to the all-time high of $2.97.

cardano,No Section,ADA Price Approaches Critical Threshold as Cardano Foundation Boasts 13 Notable Collaborations,"Cardano  Foundation lauds 13 major notable collaborations in 2021, highlighting significant growth for the year. Cardano's price may approach the critical $1.80 threshold to progress higher. In a drive to create value and utility within its ecosystem, Cardano Foundation teamed up with 13 major organizations, among which are veritree, ScanTrust, Save the Children NGO, Taurus, HackerOne, COTI network, Ecoage, Coinfirm, NOWPayments, UBX, Aid Technology and BaiasWine. ?Some of our biggest accomplishments of 2021 lie within our remarkable partnerships formed throughout the year!  @veritree_   @ScanTrust   @save_children   @Hacker0x01   @taurus_hq   @COTInetwork   @ecoage   @Coinfirm_io   @NOWPayments_io   @UBXph   @aidtechnology   @BaiasWine   pic.twitter.com/vjGqHm9hWW The most recent partnership, with  Ecoage,  was announced on Dec. 22. Eco-Age, a sustainability consulting firm, was the driving force behind the Renaissance Awards, which honor activists from all across the world. Eco-Age decided to switch out the physical statuettes of mainstream award ceremonies with non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and, therefore, partnered with Cardano for NFT creation. The Cardano blockchain was used to create 13 one-of-a-kind works of digital art. Cardano and Save the Children, one of the leading international non-profit organizations for children, formed a  collaboration  earlier this year to explore methods to leverage Cardano and the ADA digital token to assist their humanitarian operations in East Africa. Save the Children will create a financial gateway to collect ADA donations directly, without the use of intermediaries, as part of this agreement. Cardano (ADA) has been on an impressive seven-day upswing since Dec. 21, rallying nearly 30% from lows of $1.182 to reach highs of $1.594 today. At press time, ADA was exchanging hands at $1.57, up 9.0% in the last 24 hours. With a present market cap of $52,563,324,199.66, Cardano has secured the sixth spot in cryptocurrency ranking, ahead of XRP. ADA prices have risen past the $1.50 psychological level, which is a crucial area of interest, thanks to the present bullish trend. The price has now risen for the seventh day in a row and is yet overbought with the relative strength index (RSI) moving higher. Near-term action is expected to remain higher while above the RSI's midline of 50. Next month may be quite eventful for Cardano as the average price forecast by end of 2021 remains above $1.50, with established lows of $1.18 since mid-December. Overall, ADA may continue to sustain its upside momentum into 2022.",https://u.today/ada-price-approaches-critical-threshold-as-cardano-foundation-boasts-13-notable-collaborations,utoday,2021-12-27,13:52:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Wants to Fix DeFi Sector ,"Charles Hoskinson , CEO of Cardano developer Input Output, spoke about the pitfalls of decentralized finance during a YouTube livestream from his home in the state of Colorado, claiming that many users are incredibly tired of the low production quality of applications within the DeFi ecosystem. 
 
He adds that losses from scams and hacks, which took place mostly in the Ethereum space, surpassed $10.5 billion dollars in 2021. 
 
The Input Output boss says that many projects in the crypto space rely on “a hope and a prayer” instead of rigorous engineering. Hence, he is convinced that many projects will not stand the test of time.      It’s very hard to do this kind of engineering, and it’s very hard to do this kind of engineering right and with an eye in foresight for the future.        The crypto billionaire says that Cardano will be able to fix this by creating a specific set of standards for DeFi in order to weed out poor-quality applications. 
 
The Ouroboros family of consensus protocols will make sure that Cardano will stick around for decades, according to Hoskinson. 
 
The Cardano founder says that he’s tired of  “tribalism”  and “maximalism,” encouraging cooperation within the crypto space. Speeding up transactions on Cardano will be possible with the help of Hydra, a scaling solution named after a mythological monster, and sidechains. Hoskinson expects billions of users to become part of the ecosystem within the following decades. 
 
Hoskinson says that a record number of developers are working on Cardano’s core infrastructure as well as its DeFi ecosystem. 
 
Earlier this year, Cardano came under fire after a decentralized exchange failed to perform transactions due to  the concurrency issue  that Hoskinson claims is  ""completely"" made-up. ",https://u.today/cardano-founder-wants-to-fix-defi-sector,utoday,2021-12-27,20:44:00,en
cardano, News ," ‘The only thing holding us back is us,’ says Charles Hoskinson on DeFi's future ","The total value locked, or TVL, in decentralized finance (DeFi) has soared to over $250 billion as 2021 closes out, with most activity on Ethereum,  according  to DeFi Llama. The budding DeFi industry only became mainstream during summer 2021. While TVL valuations underscore the rapid growth of the industry, Cardano ( ADA ) founder Charles Hoskinson has warned about the challenges facing DeFi. In a YouTube video entitled, ""DApps and Cardano DeFi Alliance,"" Hoskinson talked about DeFi's potential as well as Cardano's small role within the industry.  According to Hoskinson, who has been on a decade-long quest to transform traditional finance, there needs to be more long-term vision among developers and creators: “It’s very hard to do this kind of engineering and to do it right, with an eye and foresight for the future. Unfortunately, many of the projects in this space will not stand the test of time. It’s just a fact that we will see a great extinction occur in the next five to 10 years.” Related:  DeFi can be 100 times larger than today in 5 years Although he believes that 2022 will be “a big year” for both the industry and Cardano, there is “still so much to do,” particularly when it comes to certification standards, the production quality of DApps and security. He noted that almost $10.5 billion have been lost to hacks, scams and theft in the sector in 2021 alone. Despite considering the crypto community to be “the weavers of the genetics of finance and of the destiny of humanity’s financial operating system for the 21st century,” Hoskinson claims that the “only thing that holds us back is  us . If we fight each other, demean and attack each other, all we are doing is hurting our ability to be able to steer the dialogue towards productive ends.” Related:  Cardano’s ADA price eyes 30% rally with a potential ‘triple bottom’ setup During the session, Hoskinson talked about Cardano’s current plans, mentioning its 127 projects in development and how the first half of 2022 will be “an essential window for commercialization and utility of Cardano projects.” He expects the user count to grow tenfold from the current 2 million users due to the nonfungible token revolution.  Hoskinson also  introduced  the Cardano DeFi Alliance, or CDA, to drive collaboration among developers. He hopes to take Cardano from being a custodial entity to a fully formed open-source platform with the ability to include hundreds more projects across the entire industry.  Cardano's  ADA  was one of the top-performing cryptocurrencies through the first half of 2021. Despite being backed by a strong community,  Cardano has been criticized  for its slow progress and lengthy development timelines. The network achieved a major milestone in September with the Alonzo hard fork, though concerns remained that  real utility for the platform  was still on the distant horizon.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-only-thing-holding-us-back-is-us-says-charles-hoskinson-on-defi-s-future,cointelegraph,2021-12-28,00:00:00,en

Hoskinson says that Cardano will be able to fix the highlighted pitfalls by creating a specific set of standards for DeFi to weed out poor-quality applications. The Ouroboros consensus protocols will ensure that Cardano sticks around for a longer time, he says. The year 2021 has been a remarkable one in terms of partnerships for the Cardano Foundation, launching 13 notable collaborations, including that of Eco-Age and Save the Children NGO. Cardano has been in a rally since mid-December, attaining highs of $1.594 in the prior session. ADA/USD steadily climbed higher, trading six days consecutively in the green. However, this might follow a period of consolidation and minor pullback. Cardano might resume its uptrend in the following sessions. At the time of writing, the ADA/USD pair is exchanging hands at $1.481 and might be set for an explosive rally past the moving average (MA 50) toward its next resistance at $1.80. The Cardano breakout seeks to breach the descending trendline barrier above the $1.50 psychological level. It has sustained a seven-day day gain above 15% in the last 24 hours while setting an intraday low of $1.432 presently. On its daily chart, the rising relative strength index (RSI) above its midline 50 in the positive territory suggests that the bulls are still in command, indicating more room for growth.

According to the official announcement shared by Flickto, its ongoing initial decentralized exchange offering on KICK.io which is a popular Cardano-based launchpad, exceeded all expectations in the first hours after its launch. The Flickto IDO has had an overwhelming response from the Cardano & KICK community. We smashed our original target and look set to hit our stretch target soon. As such, we've now got a super stretch target. Will we hit that before the IDO ends? To buy:  https://t.co/Ha49C9OM0a   pic.twitter.com/J6vJ2xfG2Q Launched only midday on Dec. 28, 2021, the IDO tokensale is available for all of KICK.io’s customers with ADA tokens. The minimum IDO allocation is capped at $50, or about $0.01 for FLICK. Initially, the Flickto team had planned to raise $350,000 on IDO by selling 38 million FLICK. However, more than half of this cap was reached in less than two hours. In seven hours, the IDO hard cap was raised to $500,000. Then, with 83% of FLICK tokens sold, the target was raised yet again to $750,000. It should be noted that these decisions were made during the preliminary stage of the token sale, the so-called “Priority Round.” Only Cardano enthusiasts with at least 10,000 KICK bags can participate in this round. So, the token sale smashed numerous targets even before the general public was able to join IDO pools. All relevant statistics are  displayed  on KICK.io’s page for FLICK token sale. As such, community interest in participating in Flickto fundraising is above all expectations - both those of Flickto itself and the KICK.io launchpad experts. As covered by U.Today previously, Flickto is a unique community-first product on Cardano (ADA). It leverages Cardano to raise funds for media projects. Its economics is based on the concept of initial staking pool offerings (or ISPOs): users can stake tokens to support their favorite media products and to receive income in the event of their success. The project is backed by Ben Morris and Geraint Harvard Jones, directors and producers, recognized as media market veterans all over the globe.

It complies with Haskell code, designed to make smart contracts building easier and more resource-efficient. A new article about ADALend is out!!?? 
This is just a gentle reminder that the initial round of the ADALend private sale ends at midnight GMT on 31st December!⌛️? Hurry up not to miss the chance to lock your allocation of ADALend!?? 
Read more here: https://t.co/7QLUkiNHnm Plutus Application Backend (PAB) is a toolkit set to ease dApps development so that Cardano-based applications creators are able to focus on front-end issues. PAB includes ready-made smart contracts and libraries. It allows the platform to act as a cornerstone for decentralized on-chain tokenomics on Cardano (ADA). Also, PAB's toolkit is flexible: it can be tailored for a plethora of use cases crucial for the global Web3 ecosystem at any moment. Besides that, PAB tools enable an ultimate level of scalability and security for all Cardano-based dApps. Plutus Application Backend (PAB) is a multi-platform ecosystem: it is designed to advance the process of development for both desktop and mobile applications. It is able to support the sophisticated business logics required for modern DeFi ecosystems. The unparalleled scalability of Plutus Application Backend (PAB) allows ADALend to handle a near-infinite number of decentralized lending/borrowing modules. All of them will interact with Plutus Core in a secure and noncustodial manner. Besides that, PAB can create bridges between emulated and non-emulated software systems on Plutus. It makes Plutus Application Backend (PAB) the go-to solution for stress testing business operations for early-stage dApps. However, Plutus Application Backend (PAB) does not affect the business logics of the products it interacts with: it does not affect decentralization and security modules and cannot be utilized as an attack vector against new DeFis. As covered by U.Today previously, ADALend promotes itself as an instrument of top-notch lending/borrowing practices for Cardano (ADA). Fueled by $540,000 funding from a clutch of reputable VCs, it addresses the flash loans sphere.

As the calendar year comes to an end, Cardano’s personable leader Charles Hoskinson shares a message of optimism, unity and collaboration for the future of crypto. As a gesture of goodwill for the holiday season, this week our long-form DeFi newsletter will be published in full here as an article alongside the regular email. Subscribe below for full access to next week's edition! Polygon fixes potential billion-dollar protocol vulnerability  Layer-two protocol Polygon announced this week the  rectification of a potentially multi-billion-dollar vulnerability  in its proof-of-stake Genesis contract through implementing an Emergency Bor Upgrade to the mainnet. The incident and subsequent upgrade took place at the beginning of December. If compromised to the fullest extent by a malicious entity, the vulnerability could have resulted in almost $24 billion in financial losses, equating to 92.7% of the network’s native MATIC tokens and effectively causing imminent demise. All you need to know about the recent Polygon network update. ✅A security partner discovered a vulnerability ✅Fix was immediately introduced ✅Validators upgraded the network ✅No material harm to the protocol/end-users ✅White hats were paid a bounty  https://t.co/oyDkvohg33 — Polygon | $MATIC  (@0xPolygon)  December 29, 2021 
 
 According to a recent blog post from Polygon, two good-willed whitehat hackers, Leon Spacewalker and Whitehat2, discovered the incident on Dec. 3 and Dec. 4, respectively, alerting blockchain security platform Immunefi. Following procedural investigation and authentication from Immunefi, the information was passed to Polygon, which upgraded the network on Dec. 5, albeit a hacker was able to drain 801,601 MATIC ($2.04 million) before the bug was resolved.  Polygon co-founder Jaynti Kanani emphasized the network’s ability to promptly resolve the critical bug, noting in a blog  post  that: “What’s important is that this was a test of our network’s resilience as well as our ability to act decisively under pressure. Considering how much was at stake, I believe our team has made the best decisions possible given the circumstances.” Leon Spacewalker is set to be rewarded a cool $2.2 million in stablecoins for their efforts, while the second anonymous hacker, Whitehat2, will pocket $1.27 million in MATIC tokens directly from Polygon. Related:  Here's how Polygon is challenging the limitations of Ethereum, as told by co-founder Sandeep Nailwal Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson predicts DeFi “greater extinction” This week, in an end-of-year YouTube live stream titled “DApps and Cardano DeFi Alliance,”  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  spoke candidly about the emerging landscape of DeFi projects and creators on Cardano in addition to advising participants about the volatile nature of exponential markets.  “It’s very hard to do this kind of engineering and to do it right, with an eye and foresight for the future. Unfortunately, many of the projects in this space will not stand the test of time. It’s just a fact that we will see a great extinction occur in the next five to 10 years.” Broadcasting with evident enthusiasm from “warm sunny Colorado” — a location which he humorously describes as “always warm, always sunny, sometimes Colorado” — Hoskinson predicted a big year ahead for the cryptocurrency space and his beloved Cardano. The “only thing that holds us back is us,” he said before exclaiming that empathetic and friendly collaboration is a fundamental component to productive dialogue and progress toward our shared pursuit of a more prosperous financial future. Following the successful launch of Cardano’s smart contracts in September through the Alonzo hard fork, the project has come under scrutiny for tedious developments on its roadmap. Despite this, Hoskinson believes that the user count will exceed 10 times the current 2 million in 2022 because of the vast demand within the nonfungible token space.  Alongside this, Hoskinson introduced the Cardano DeFi Alliance, an initiative that seeks to construct an open-source library of resources, tools, services and best practices to cultivate the growth of the entire DeFi ecosystem. Related:  Cardano’s ADA price eyes 30% rally with a potential ‘triple bottom’ setup Huobi Research predicts rise in play-to-earn games in 2022 Huobi Research, the research arm of crypto exchange Huobi, has identified GameFi — which refers to the combination of gaming and decentralized finance — as an emerging trend based on its quantitative analysis of on-chain data. In an extensive blog post, Huobi detailed GameFi projects’ sharp increases in user activity and volume transacted since June, stating “DApp rankings show that five of the top nine apps are GameFi apps."" Further, ""as of early December [2021], GameFi’s weekly active users have reached 9.21 million, a record high.” Thanks  @Cointelegraph  for covering the report. Read it ➡️ https://t.co/MnG14w5KNW   https://t.co/mzFggnLp0z — Huobi Research (@Huobi_Research)  December 30, 2021 
 
 The researchers noted that these games differ from traditional games, such as World of Warcraft, across three distinctive categories: free trading of game materials, free trading and pricing of game currencies, and protection of property rights. Huobi Research argues that GameFi’s ability to “significantly reduce transaction fees for gold farming,” a term used to denote the conversion of in-game tokens to real-world currency, is the primary reason for its heightened financial appeal: “In GameFi, the owners have the right to decide whether to sell certain resources or not, which lifts the degree of user independence and stimulates market competition, thus saving transaction costs.” Additionally, developers in the GameFi space have the advantage of deploying private property rights via nonfungible tokens at a lower cost: “This not only is a comparative advantage that traditional game developers never had, but also reflects the intrinsic value of blockchain technology in the gaming industry,” the firm stated.

cardano, News , VCs don't understand that Cardano has a community: Charles Hoskinson ,"In a recent YouTube video, Charles Hoskinson highlighted the rapid growth of the Cardano ( ADA ) ecosystem while clarifying the concerns raised by other members of the crypto community over the past year. “We live in a world where arbitrary groups of people get to be fact-checkers and decide what's legitimate,” said Hoskinson while speaking about the government’s perception of cryptocurrencies. He pointed out that a vast majority of financial crimes are done with the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies.  According to Hoskinson, the growth of the crypto ecosystem this year might be slower than 2022: “It's hard to argue with the $2.5 trillion industry and imagine where that's going to go. I think we're just going to digest as an industry the consequences for better or worse of becoming so big so quickly.” He also highlighted the need to change Silicon Valley’s “bizarre mantra of move fast and break things” in crypto, which caused losses of $10.5 billion in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space in 2021. Stressing Cardano’s slow and methodical approach, Hoskinson said: “That's why VCs don't even actually understand that Cardano has a community. They think it's just me behind a microphone.” Hoskinson also said that Cardano will gradually transition into a permanent open source project and compared it to Linux operating system. He hopes to move away from a hierarchical structure to open-source DApps developed by the members of the Cardano community: “They [the developers] should also commit to putting at least one of their developers to contributing to the Cardano protocol.” In the long-term, Hoskinson envisions faster completion of the Cardano roadmap through this “small resource commitment.” He called out YouTubers, podcasters and VCs that have questioned Cardano’s growth by saying “we're number one for GitHub commits”: “If you're such an expert that you're going to opine on the quality of our comments then tell us which ones are wrong, which ones don't mean anything and what parts of the roadmap we're failing at dramatically.” Related:  ‘The only thing holding us back is us,’ says Charles Hoskinson on DeFi's future In a similar live YouTube session, Hoskinson spoke about DeFi's potential as well as Cardano's small role within the industry.  According to him, developers and creators need to foster a more long-term vision: “It’s very hard to do this kind of engineering and to do it right, with an eye and foresight for the future. Unfortunately, many of the projects in this space will not stand the test of time. It’s just a fact that we will see a great extinction occur in the next five to 10 years.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/vcs-don-t-understand-that-cardano-has-a-community-charles-hoskinson,cointelegraph,2022-01-01,00:00:00,en

The meme contains a letter to the IRS from a tax payer who explains losing 90 percent of their crypto funds after earning 6,900 percent on staking $7,000 worth of CumRocket (a cryptocurrency project ranked 863 on the CoinMarketCap list), then investing the earnings in NFTitties (an NFT project that depicts women’s breasts) and then losing almost all of it after the devs made a rugpull, taking away their investors’ funds. https://t.co/DA5o7gEOG4 The question asked by the author of the letter in the meme is whether the IRS does mind deducting the gas fees for the minting and the balance from the tax on short term capital gains. Gentlemen, this is where we are at  pic.twitter.com/Huyu63uMmr At the moment, according to a definition by the IRS, cryptocurrency is a taxable property. Investors are taxed on the difference between the price they buy and sell at. For crypto held less than one year, investors have to pay from 10 percent to 37 percent by regular marginal tax rates. In summer 2021, Hoskinson was one of the crypto industry leaders who was strongly against the  tough crypto taxing initiative  that a group of US senators attempted to pass. The goal was to collect $1 trillion, including more than $25 billion that the Senate was hoping to collect from crypto investors and traders. The one trillion USD infrastructure bill was planned to be used to realize construction projects all over the United States. John Lennon’s younger son Sean, known for his pro-crypto stance,  supported Hoskinson in a series of tweets .

cardano,No Section,Cardano Improvement Proposals Might Strengthen ADA 2022 Fundamentals,"IOHK CEO  Charles Hoskinson recently mentioned the Cardano Improvement Proposals, a set of community-governed network enhancements slated to go live in 2022. Nearly 22 proposals have been drafted, including human-readable information for assets issued on Cardano and a native web wallet for interacting with the DeFi protocol. Dubbed CIP 14, the User-Facing Asset Fingerprint aims to come up with human-readable information for assets. Cardano's Mary era offers support for native assets, which are uniquely identified by their policy ID and asset name. Because assets are managed in a variety of user-facing features on desktop and hardware applications, Cardano believes it is necessary to create a short(er) and human-readable asset identifier that users would know and refer to when discussing assets. Dubbed CIP 30, the Cardano dApp-Wallet Web Bridge aims to create a webpage-based communication bridge allowing webpages (i.e., dApps) to interface with Cardano wallets. There are various use cases for this such as NFT management. Another, the proposed CIP 7 or Curve Pledge Benefit, aims to modify the current reward calculation equation, with the opportunity to increase incentives for pool operators. Charles Hoskinson disclosed in a whiteboard video on dApps and development that the Cardano network planned to spend the next six to nine months improving its decentralized applications (dApps) ecosystem. Whiteboard: DApps and Development  https://t.co/jyg2nzF4bC Among these are Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), to be implemented in June, e.g, read-only UTXO. He also spoke on the design considerations that went into building Cardano's extended UTXO (eUTXO) model, speaking at length on its expressiveness. He hinted at an optimization plan in 2022 that aims to increase block size, improve node efficiency and network stack, as well as shore up Cardano's transaction throughput to 500-1000 TPS (transactions per second). U.Today,  earlier reported about a dozen  Cardano  projects earmarked for launch in 2022.

Cardano beat Ethereum’s development activity by a wide margin, with the latter coming in fourth place. Santiment  defines  a GitHub event as either creating an issue, creating a pull request, commenting on an issue or pull request, or forking/starring/watching a code repository, among others.  The Most Developed Cryptos on  @Github  in 2021  According to  @Santimentfeed ,  @Cardano , has become the most developed project in the industry, followed by  @Kusamanetwork , and  @Polkadot .  https://t.co/gjKPmOazyB   pic.twitter.com/JHXmWSe0YS — CryptoRank Platform (@CryptoRank_io)  January 3, 2022 
 
 In a live Youtube session last week,  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  revealed that there are approximately 127 projects under development on the Cardano blockchain. In addition, Hoskinson expects the number of  ADA  users to grow tenfold from the existing 2 million, thanks to the growing popularity of nonfungible tokens, or NFTs. Cardano’s technological advancement is also gaining traction post-Alonzo. One of the blockchain's notable works in progress is the  layer-two Hydra upgrade , which channels transactions off-chain to staking pools without partitioning the ledger itself. Theoretically, it could enable advanced linear scaling of the network with hundreds of “hydra nodes” each processing hundreds of transactions. Related:  VCs don't understand that Cardano has a community: Charles Hoskinson Another notable mention is a novel fintech funding mechanism, known as the initial stake pool offering (ISPO), that’s unique to the Cardano blockchain. In this setup, blockchain enthusiasts delegate their cryptocurrencies in a protocol and receive tokens of the new project they fund as rewards. In contrast, the ADA staking rewards go to the developers. Funds do not leave the delegator’s wallet, making the process rather secure. One such project,  Genius Yield , saw its ISPO pools surpass $118 million within 24 hours.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-became-the-most-developed-crypto-on-github-in-2021-santiment,cointelegraph,2022-01-03,00:00:00,en

The Bitcoin community has another reason to celebrate apart from the arrival of the New Year: the BTC network has never been as strong as it is now thanks to the flagship crypto's hashrate reaching  a new record peak  of 203.5 exahashes per second. By the end of the week, Bitcoin mining difficulty is expected to rise to 24.98 trillion, barely a hair's breadth away from the 25 trillion threshold set in May before the China ban. On Jan. 2, Whale Alert crypto tracker reported that after unlocking 1 billion XRP tokens on the first day of the new year, Ripple transferred  200 million XRP . Some time later, anon crypto whales followed suit and moved a similar amount of tokens, 225.3 million XRP, which equals $190,900,260 in fiat. The third transaction reported by Whale Alert was Bitstamp moving 20,154,126 XRP to custodial service BitGo. The XRP price is currently struggling in the $0.8 range. The XRP community believes that the only thing preventing the coin from surging is the SEC v. Ripple case. Therefore, XRP supporters are waiting for April 2022 when, according to attorney  Jeremy Hogan's prediction , the case would be over. Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  has again shared his negative stance on the current U.S. system of taxing crypto by posting a meme about the IRS. In the meme, a taxpayer is asking the service to deduct gas fees for minting and the balance from tax on short-term capital gains after losing 90% of their crypto funds. The taxpayer earned 6,900% on staking $7,000 worth of CumRocket, then invested the earnings in NFTitties and lost almost all of it after the devs performed a rugpull. Back in August 2021, Hoskinson fiercely opposed the  tough crypto taxing initiative  that a group of U.S. senators attempted to pass. In a lengthy Twitter thread, Ethereum co-founder  Vitalik Buterin  decided to reflect on his earlier predictions and to share what he thinks about the matter now. In one of his tweets, he called  Bitcoin Cash  ""mostly a failure"" since it primarily formed as a protest movement based on a rebellious mindset. This is why it lacks a coherent vision for moving forward. Even though the 27-year-old programmer admitted that some of his past comments are laughable (like his initial proof-of-stake and sharding roadmap), a couple of others, he believes, are still worth being proud of. Back in 2013, Buterin predicted that altcoins would become big even before they were cool and also foresaw the emergence of a decentralized exchange like Uniswap. According to the latest news,  nine companies  joined the SHIB Burn Pledge, willing to participate in the Shiba Inu token burning initiative. By signing on to this pledge, businesses agree to send a fixed percentage of profits, sales or a dollar amount to the official SHIB burn wallet.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano, Ethereum Have Taken On NFT Space and Are Moving Forward: Bloomberg Expert","Bloomberg’s market expert Eddie van der Walt believes that 2021 saw a real breakthrough for  cryptocurrencies  as crypto became a firm “part of the financial furniture”. Bloomberg's Eddie van der Walt on the outlook for crypto in 2022  pic.twitter.com/kjeJOxPDEx Compared to just a couple of years ago, when institutions and financial experts used to say that Bitcoin and other crypto “are going to zero” and they are “worthless”, the situation has changed for the better a lot by now. In 2021, the crypto industry saw multiple ETFs arrive, including the first Bitcoin futures-based one in the US approved by the SEC. Besides, the expert says, there have been several IPOs in the crypto space with Coinbase exchange being one of them. Walt confirmed that now there is a whole infrastructure out there that has allowed financial institutions to start entering the space (and Bitcoin in particular) with big amounts of funds. For these particular reasons, Eddie van der Walt stressed, 2021 was a real breakthrough for crypto and has set up a bright future for this space. In 2022, Walt believes, cryptocurrencies are going to define “what they mean, what they are and what we will do with them”, obviously hinting at specific utility. In particular, Walt mentioned such top-tier blockchains as  Cardano  and Ethereum, saying that they “have taken on the  NFT space  and have moved in the narrative a little bit forward in terms of what we are gonna do with cryptocurrencies”. He did not mention, though, dapps and smart contracts that Ethereum has been the first platform for and Cardano now allowing devs to use them on it as well after the Alonzo upgrade in September, aside from just letting users create non-fungible tokens. Since regulators are only awakening to decide how to handle the crypto space, in the US in particular, Walt has called regulation a big risk factor for crypto, since they have not been regulated before. Therefore, at the moment there is a sort of regulatory arbitrage between crypto and regular assets. And that, according to the Bloomberg expert, could be negative for the cryptocurrencies in the short term. However, in the long-term prospect, regulation for crypto assets would be good, he believes, since it would allow more investors – both institutional and private ones – to get involved with them.",https://u.today/cardano-ethereum-have-taken-on-nft-space-and-are-moving-forward-bloomberg-expert,utoday,2022-01-04,14:12:00,en

Hoskinson described how he sees this in a few words: a customer in Kenya or any other country in  Africa , who has a blockchain-based identity and a credit score, can receive a loan in crypto via stablecoins in just one click and pay it back later in the same manner. Transactions here would be settled on Cardano. At the moment, Hoskinson reminded, in the microfinance space, the interest rate is 35-80% per annum with a 40% default rate. As for Pezesha, he started, its interest rate is 3-4% per month (36% per annum) with a default rate of just 2%. Hosk stated that once this Cardano-based financial operating system turns on with Pezesha, it is going to be bigger than the traditional microfinance space in Africa. He believes that this would lead to interest rates dropping gradually due to competition because of the oversupply of capital relative to clients. The second thing is that he believes with this partnership Cardano will completely circumvent the banking system in Africa.

According to the popular Chinese crypto journalist  Colin Wu , this is the lowest since July 21 last year. However, many consider this to be a good opportunity to buy the dip. U.Today reminds the crypto community that they should do their own research in the crypto space. Crypto prices can show extreme volatility, so one must not spend on them more than one can afford to lose. The Crypto Fear and Greed Index fell to 10, the lowest since July 21, 2021.  pic.twitter.com/ZNbTnuH3cb",https://u.today/btc-eth-bnb-ada-sol-face-extreme-bearishness-report,utoday,2022-01-08,10:04:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Sees an Increase in GitHub Commits as Network Vows Updates in Early 2022,"According to  IntotheBlock  analytics, Cardano has seen a rise in Github commits since the start of 2022. IOHK, Cardano's parent company, vows regular updates amid anticipation of the launch of new dApps in early 2022. Most crypto-assets' codes are publicly available on Github, thanks to crypto's open-source, permissionless nature. A Github commit is a set of modifications made by one or more developers to the source code of a crypto-asset. Commits are an indicator of the activity, evolution and upkeep of the software that surrounds a crypto-asset. While development activity has little to no impact on short-term market trends, it is an underrated indicator of project success because it reflects the team's month-to-month dedication to building a working product, improving and upgrading its features, and sticking to its long-term roadmap. According to IntoTheBlock, Cardano has seen a growing trend in Github commits. The recent rise surrounds an improvement in network parameters as the Cardano Node upgrades to version 1.33.0. As stated on the  Cardano roadmap's  official website, improvements carried out in the prior week include that on the hard fork combinator and mempool in preparation for the next steps in UTXO HD integration. As reported by  U.Today,  Cardano ranked the most developed asset in 2021, with an average of 53 daily contributors to its Github repo as indicated by Santiment. On the itinerary of events, 2022 will see Cardano move first into Basho and then into Voltaire. The Basho phase focuses on optimization, scaling and network growth. Over 175 projects are currently building on Cardano, according to IOHK CEO Charles Hoskinson, with a dozen set to launch in Q1. With hundreds of thousands more users expected to join Cardano in the coming months, this could result in significant traffic on the Cardano network when new decentralized applications (DApps) are released, especially in its early days and weeks. Cardano has announced that it would begin making a series of changes to its network parameters to support this continued development. In this vein, the Cardano Node version 1.33.0, a performance-oriented node, was released. The node update aims to bring significant improvements in sync time and block propagation time, and reduce memory usage. Disclosing this in a  thread of tweets , IOHK, Cardano's parent company states, ""We have some exciting months ahead. Expect FUD too. We'll continue to bring you regular updates throughout early 2022 as we continue to add capacity and increase secure throughput.""",https://u.today/cardano-sees-an-increase-in-github-commits-as-network-vows-updates-in-early-2022,utoday,2022-01-10,14:41:00,en

The majority of altcoin tokens are likewise down in the last seven days, with several recording losses between 10% and 30%. However, tokens such as Chainlink (LINK, +31.14%), Cosmos (ATOM, + 6.11%) and Internet Computer (ICP, +34.97%) are up on a weekly basis. The cryptomarket tanked on Jan. 5 along with the equities market minutes after the U.S. Federal Reserve's December meeting indicated that the central bank could hike interest rates as soon as this March.

cardano,Business,Cardano Reaches Goal of Planting 1M Trees,"A restoration effort using the Cardano blockchain reached its first goal of planting over 1 million trees, the Cardano Foundation, a non-profit that oversees developments on the Cardano network, said over the weekend. “The Cardano Forest is 100% funded, we’ve reached the 1 million trees milestone. All trees planted will be recorded on the Cardano blockchain for enhanced transparency and serve as public proof of land restoration activities,” Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said in a  tweet thread . The foundation has partnered with crypto startup Veritree for the planting effort. Veritree uses blockchain technology to record the supply chain of tree plantations for its users, allowing for a verifiable tracking of such activities. Veritree plants a tree each time Cardano’s ADA currency is exchanged for a TREE token. TREE, in turn, can be redeemed for digital trees and non-fungible tokens ( NFT ) during certain “redemption days,” with the rarity of the issued NFTs based on the initial amount of ADA exchanged. NFTs are digital assets that can represent ownership of unique tangible and intangible items on a blockchain. Transactional data shows large amounts of ADA were bestowed towards the effort. One wallet exchanged 100,000 ADA for 100,000 TREE tokens – worth over $118,000 at the time of writing – to become the biggest donor for the cause. Other large donors exchanged amounts ranging from 5,000 ADA (≈$5,900 at press time) to 87,500 ADA (≈$103,900 at press time). Why plant trees? The Cardano Forest activity is part of a broader effort by Cardano to become a climate-positive blockchain. Blockchain technology has been the subject of massive criticism in recent years about the blockchain’s environmental impact. Blockchains run on a global network of users or organizations that use their computing resources – by either staking crypto or running mining rigs – to validate data and process transactions on that network. Mining, in particular, consists of specialized computing systems that solve millions of calculations each second to “win” blocks, using huge amounts of electricity to keep running. Such usage of computing resources is deemed unnecessary by critics, who say the large electricity requirements damage the environment. Newer blockchains like Cosmos, Terra and Cardano run on a proof-of-stake concept that relies on network “stakers” who lock up their tokens on public nodes to maintain the blockchain. This is said to be more environmentally friendly than mining. Planting trees is a step in an environmentally friendly direction. The ethos is simple: The creation of more trees can, in theory, offset the damage done by human activity in other parts of the world. Cardano Foundation and Veritree did not return requests for comment at press time.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/10/cardano-reaches-goal-of-planting-1m-trees/,coindesk,2022-01-10,11:09:00,en

BTC/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView Nonetheless, the  losses suffered by Bitcoin  still appear less than that of some of its top crypto rivals' performances. For instance, Cardano ( ADA ), the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market valuation, has dropped by nearly 11% to around $1.15 in the last seven days. Similarly, Ripple ( XRP ), the eighth-largest by market capitalization, has dipped by around 10% to nearly $0.75 in the same period. Meanwhile, some cryptocurrencies listed among the top 50 digital assets have experienced bigger losses between 15% and 30% in the last week. They include Ethereum's native token Ether ( ETH ), which has plunged over 16%, and its blockchain rival Terra, whose token  LUNA  has declined by nearly 20.50%. That said, listed below are three tokens among the top 50 cryptocurrencies that have performed worse than Bitcoin on a seven-day adjusted timeframe. Axie Infinity (-27.50%) Sitting atop  more than 12,000% year-over-year profits , Axie Infinity (AXS) turned out to be one of the best places for traders to secure their profits. AXS price plunged nearly 27.5%  to around $70 in the last seven days, thus becoming the worst performer among the large-cap coins. Meanwhile, against Bitcoin, the token slipped by almost 17% to 0.0017 BTC in the same period. ASX/USD vs. AXS/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView Nevertheless,  AXS price may rebound  in the coming days as one of the market's key momentum indicators, the relative strength index (RSI), alerts about the token's ""oversold"" status. In detail, the AXS's daily RSI has slipped below 30, which traditional chartists interpret as a buy signal. More bullish cues for the  Axie Infinity token  have been coming from its downside target area between $64.50 and $50, as shown in the chart below. Notably, the $64.50-level served as a support to the AXS price during the August–September trading session in 2021. AXS/USD daily price chart featuring its potential downside targets. Source: TradingView Similarly, the levels around $50 prompted traders to accumulate AXS en masse on four occasions since Sept. 7 selloff. Conversely, breaking below the downside target range may end up pushing below $40, another support level from August 2021. AAVE (-25%) Unlike Axie Infinity, Aave ( AAVE ) native token of the same name had been sitting atop dwarfed year-over-year profits — nearly 60% since Jan. 10, 2021. Nonetheless, it has still become one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies entering 2022. AAVE price dropped by a little over 24%  to $200 in the last seven days. Meanwhile, the token's performance against Bitcoin came out to be nearly -15%, reflecting that traders remained unconvinced about a bullish rebound in the Aave market. AAVE/USD vs. AAVE/BTC daily price chart. Source: TradingView For instance, AAVE's daily RSI has been trending lower since Dec. 27 and now sits near 39. It now eyes an extended correction to reach its oversold levels below 30, meaning there is still room for the AAVE price to go further down than its current rates. The sell signal appears also as AAVE retests its two-month-old ascending trendline support, as shown in the chart below. AAVE has rebounded at least four times from the said rising level since Dec. 4. Therefore, if the coin breaks below it, its likelihood of correcting toward $165, another support level, would be higher. AAVE/USD daily price chart featuring its interim support and resistance targets. Source: TradingView Conversely, a rebound from the ascending trendline support may have AAVE rally toward the $250–$275 trading range, which has a recent history of acting as both resistance and support. Since December 2021, the area has been able to cap AAVE's upside attempts successfully IOTA (-24%) Based on their seven-day adjusted timeframe performance,  IOTA 's losses are marginally less than AAVE's. But given the token has been  sitting atop nearly 150% year-over-year profits , it appears like a good sell for traders looking to offset their losses elsewhere during the recent crypto market decline. Notably, IOTA's price dipped a little over 24% to $1.00 in the past seven days. Against Bitcoin, IOTA is down about 14% in the same period. IOTA/USD vs. IOTA/BTC weekly price chart. Source: TradingView Related:  Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch in 2022: BTC, ETH, BNB, AVAX, MATIC A bounce is now likely, however, as the token's daily RSI neared oversold levels, while it dropped to a trading range of $0.93–$1.00, which has a recent history of attracting buyers.

The team says that fully decentralized governance is impossible for now due to technical limitations on the Cardano blockchain, which is why it sticks with the “beta” label.  
 
As  reported by U.Today , SundaeSwap launched its testnet version on Dec. 5.    
 
In late December, the DEX completed its audit in collaboration with Runtime Verification (RV).   SundaeSwap’s initial staking offering (ISO) will also kick off on the same day. 
 
Thirty stake pools that were selected by the community in November will take part in the ISO. 
 
The ISO, which will last for five epochs, will allow stake pool delegators to earn SundaeSwap (SUNDAE) tokens on top of their regular ADA rewards. ADA tokens have to be delegated to “ISO scoopers” prior to Jan. 25 in order to take part in the first round.   
 
SundaeSwap is by far the most popular Cardano-based DEX, with its social media following greatly surpassing Minswap and Maladex. 
 
On Jan. 20, liquidity providers will also start earning yield farming rewards that will be available at least until June. Half a million SUNDAE tokens will be allocated to yield farmers participating in a selection of liquidity pools. The ADA price is up more than 8% over the past 24 hours, according to  CoinMarketCap data , vastly outperforming the rest of the top cryptocurrencies.

Just getting started Lark, it's just January  https://t.co/ToJ923QOAk Lark Davis had reported that Cardano (ADA) was the number two blockchain in transaction volume in the last 24 hours after Bitcoin (BTC). As  U.Today  reported, Cardano is ahead of Ethereum in terms of transaction volume over the past 24 hours ($7.02 billion and $5.41 billion, respectively) as per Messari data. According to Santiment, Cardano is one of the few large-cap crypto assets seeing positive gains kicking off the new week. ADA is the only top 100 asset that gained double-digit percentages (+11%) in the past 24 hours. In the last seven days, Cardano is up 29.84% and ranks fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap data. ?  #Cardano  is one of the few large cap  #crypto  assets seeing nice gains kicking off the new week.

Nice article by  @timbharrison   https://t.co/VhFpuMbfSB According to an IOHK  blogpost , the path Cardano intends to take to achieve scaling in 2022 includes: Block size increase, Pipelining, Input Endorsers, Improvements in Memory/CPU parameters for Plutus, Node enhancements, on-disk storage, sidechains, Layer 2 Hydra scaling solution, Offloading computation and the Mithril solution. On the Cardano blockchain, the block size was recently increased from 8KB to 72KB (a 12.5% increase). Further improvements will be implemented over time, according to IOHK, based on ongoing system monitoring and overall network health. Input endorsers will also increase block propagation times and throughput, allowing for larger transaction rates. dcSpark's Milkomeda and IOG's Mamba are two EVM sidechains set to launch on the Cardano network. In terms of memory/CPU parameters, IOHK claims that there are memory improvements in Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) management, stake distribution, live stake distribution and pools and hash representation. Cardano (ADA) was the winner of a poll conducted by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin last week, in which he asked which Ether alternative could become the world's dominant cryptocurrency by 2035.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-says-massive-inflows-into-ada-ecosystem-just-getting-started,utoday,2022-01-17,09:56:00,en
cardano,No Section,ADALend's CEO Kaspars Koskins Explains Why Cardano Is Superior to Ethereum,"Kaspars Koskins, founder and chief executive officer of  ADALend  decentralized lending protocol, is one of the earliest figureheads of Cardano's dApps ecosystem. Today, he unveils why Cardano is a smart bet for high-performance DeFis in 2022. In his recent interview, Mr. Koskins compared some mainstream smart contracts platforms. First of all, he stressed that Ethereum (ETH) blockchain is ""plagued"" with problems. You can still join our private sale round! Visit our website  https://t.co/Nj7tpRFKwW  to join!? #Cardano   #DeFi   #cryptocurrency Due to exorbitant network fees and very slow transaction finalization, Ethereum (ETH) becomes unusable for the majority of dApps. In terms of the modernization of technical solutions, Ethereum (ETH) will be replaced by more resource-efficient systems, Mr. Koskins opined. Overhyped proof-of-history (PoH) blockchain Solana (SOL) is also not a solution, in Koskins' view. This network is ""heavily"" decentralized, Koskins emphasized. As covered by U.Today previously, Dr. Gavin Wood, founder of Ethereum and Polkadot, slammed Solana (SOL) for centralization after its collapse in mid-September. While Solana was  down  for 17 hours due to a DDoS attack, its team decided to switch off the network and release an emergency update. Thus, Cardano (ADA) remains the only heavyweight with ""genuine"" decentralization as no hidden whales can take control over it. Mr. Koskins is fascinated by its inclusive and fair design: [Cardano] (…) has security, speed, and low transaction fees needed to provide a truly democratic financial solution that every person on the planet can use. That is why the ecosystem of ADALend is up and running on Cardano's smart contracts. ADALend addresses decentralized lending/borrowing operations for Cardanians; it is going to supercharge Cardano's DeFi ecosystem with the analogue of ""blue chips"": Aave Finance, Curve, Balancer and so on. Due to the highly-scalable and resource-efficient design of Cardano (ADA), ADALend's users can manage their liquidity with negligible fees and zero latency. The protocol  secured  $540,000 in seed funding from the top VCs. Recently, it was added by Cardano's creators IOHK to the ""Essentials"" list: ADALend was mentioned as a crucial dApp for Cardano's ecosystem. It is also added by first Cardano segment browser CardanoCube.io.",https://u.today/adalends-ceo-kaspars-koskins-explains-why-cardano-is-superior-to-ethereum,utoday,2022-01-17,13:16:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Surpasses Ethereum by Transaction Volume as ADA Price Soars,"According to data provided by Messari,  Cardano  is ahead of Ethereum in terms of transaction volume over the past 24 hours ($7.02 billion and $5.41 billion, respectively). The two rival cryptocurrencies are neck-and-neck when it comes to adjusted transaction volume. 
 
Notably, Cardano users only paid $66,058 in transaction fees during the last 24 hours compared to Ethereum’s $44.74 million. 
 
While critics tend to dismiss Cardano as a “ghost chain,” there’s already some prominent dApps running on the top of the proof-of-stake blockchain such as stablecoin hub Ardana, decentralized exchange Maladex, decentralized banking protocol MELD and non-fungible token marketplace CNFT.IO.   
 
As  reported by U.Today , Cardano-powered decentralized exchange SundaeSwap recently announced that it would launch its mainnet this Thursday. 
 
John Woods, director of Cardano architecture at Input Output, described numerous scaling solutions that are expected to be implemented in 2022 (Plutus script enhancements, Hydra, sidechains and Mithril). He also said that there was “an enormous” number of projects that were nearing the completion of their development: You may have a couple of extra minutes for your transaction to go through depending on how busy it is at a given time. However, we have a really really solid plan for scaling.      Last week, Cardano (ADA) also won a poll posted by Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin, in which he asks which Ether alternative could end up becoming the world’s dominant cryptocurrency by 2035. The price of the native ADA token is up roughly 7%, CoinMarketCap data shows. It has added more than 26% over the past week.    
 
It is now the fifth-biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, surpassing the USD Coin stablecoin and Solana.      ",https://u.today/cardano-surpasses-ethereum-by-transaction-volume-as-ada-price-soars,utoday,2022-01-17,06:00:00,en
cardano, How to crypto , Blockchain assessment: How to assess different chains? ,"With so many blockchain networks appearing all the time, new or even experienced crypto enthusiasts may feel overwhelmed when it comes to deciding which are the best to invest in. In this guide, we’ll outline the most important aspects of any blockchain project, and why one should pay close attention to such details when assessing the different chains on the crypto market. Use case Arguably the most important part of any  blockchain project is its use case . What is the project’s reason for existing? Is the project here to enhance payment processing? To improve on a business supply chain or to entertain users? There’s technically no such thing as an invalid use case, but some are certainly more applicable than others. For example, a  project meant to assist millions  in acquiring food is likely to earn more support than a meme coin. If one decides that a project is valuable to them and that this value can translate over to a wide audience, then that’s a point in the project’s favor. When examining use cases, it’s best to  look at the project’s white paper . For example, we can take a look at Polygon’s whitepaper, which details potential use cases associated with the platform. Community A project is nothing without its community. Blockchain technology is an open-source and user-driven solution, after all. When assessing a blockchain, it’s often best to check into the community and see how much power they have.  Reliable projects are generally as decentralized as possible, providing users from all over with the ability to hold tokens and have their say in governance. These users are usually outspoken, with public conversations happening on platforms like Reddit, Twitter and Discord. It’s usually best to join a project’s Discord server to gauge both the size and contributions of its community. Transaction speeds and scalability One’s blockchain project of choice might have the best intentions, but if the technology can’t scale or reliably process transactions, it’s at a severe disadvantage. What good is a platform that can’t serve the hundreds of thousands of customers it hopes to gain? When assessing a blockchain, it’s best to examine the network’s typical transaction speeds alongside how it intends to scale en masse. Is it possible to implement upgrades down the line? Will it, or does the network already utilize a layer-two solution? Does the solution sound realistic in the long term? The Ethereum website contains extensive documentation on its current and future scalability methods.  One can pair this factor alongside the community one, as dedicated community members would have public discussions surrounding their favorite project’s use cases and potential upgrades, as well as how it’s currently running. Consensus and governance The two most common blockchain consensus methods are p roof-of-work and proof-of-stake . Proof-of-work (PoW) networks require miners that are users who dedicate their computing power to solve complex equations and validate transactions. Miners are paid for their efforts with each block mined, though the computer power required is harmful to the environment. Proof-of-stake (PoS), on the other hand, provides power to users who hold and stake, or lock in, their digital assets. Generally, the more assets a user stakes, the more power they have within the network.  By staking, users typically become validators who then validate transactions, removing the need for miners. This process is more environmentally friendly than mining and rewards users in interest for their efforts. While both PoS and PoW have their pros and cons, many believe PoS is the future of blockchain and that PoW networks are on their way out.  After all, PoS is the more scalable option and Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency in terms of market capitalization, is  making the upgrade to PoS  over the coming months. Consensus directly affects network governance and is something to consider when assessing different blockchain networks. Team The team behind the project is just as important as the technical aspects of any blockchain. Projects should be very open regarding who’s developing a project, as well as the history and skillset of the team.  Failing to disclose the details about the development team can be a significant warning sign while assessing blockchains, as a lack of information could  mean they’re looking to scam users . While this isn’t always the case, it’s recommended to stick with projects that are open about their development process. The Polkadot project  has some of its key members available on its website, including their real names and history. That said, it could be improved by including relevant social links to the team’s profiles so that users can conduct their own research to verify the project and the team behind it.  Roadmap Not only should a blockchain have a solid reliable use case, but it should have a roadmap planned out regarding future developments and product feature additions.  A thorough roadmap generally means that the team has thought long-term about their project and how it can benefit the world. It also provides users with more knowledge about what they’re investing in, and whether or not the network aligns with their values. The Cardano roadmap  features detailed sections for each part of its roadmap, ensuring that all users can understand what to expect in the network’s future. Market capitalization/total value locked (TVL) When it comes to  decentralized finance (DeFi) projects  specifically, one vital factor to consider is its total value locked (TVL) and its market cap. The TVL represents the  total amount of all funds locked  into a DeFi platform’s smart contracts. The higher a TVL, the healthier a platform’s ecosystem, as more users are taking advantage of its offerings.  Alternatively, a project’s market capitalization constitutes the value of existing assets within its ecosystem, serving as an indicator of the project’s growth potential. This number constitutes not just those utilizing the platform’s tokens, but also those holding assets in a passive way. One can consider market capitalization to be the indicator of the popularity of a project, while TVL can mark how much money is actually being moved around within its various protocols. Both statistics are important, but it’s important to understand what each means relevant to a project’s competition.  DeFi Pulse details the TVL of all sorts of DeFi projects, while CoinMarketCap lists the market capitalization of nearly any chain on the market. Longevity Finally, take a look at how long the project has been on the market. If it has been available for years, what has the project accomplished? Has it stuck to its roadmap and been reliable, or suffered from consistent delays and failing to deliver? A project’s reliability can be a great indicator of its longevity.  Alternatively, if a project is new to the market, consider observing it for a few months and seeing how things play out. If development appears smooth and the group is making a fair amount of progress and announcements, it might mark a more reliable long-term investment.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-assessment-how-to-assess-different-chains,cointelegraph,2022-01-18,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Launches New Project to Boost Third-Party Smart Contract Development,"Cardano Foundation  has announced the launch of a new project to boost third-party smart contract development in collaboration with EMURGO, the commercial arm of the Cardano blockchain. ?Cardano Foundation &  @emurgo_io  Launch Project to Develop New  #dApp  Tool Stack  @F_Gregaard  said, “The development of this tool stack will further enable a vibrant, inclusive ecosystem for third-party smart contract development on Cardano.""

The project will be divided into two phases: MVP1 and MVP2. Five Binaries, an infrastructure development company, will build a modular tool stack for MVP1. The Cardano Foundation plans to reach out to other projects and collaborators from across the ecosystem in the second stage, MVP2, and openly invite them to contribute to the project. Cardano sees developing a second application backend for its ecosystem as quite essential as it might help increase the diversity of options available for developers to build solutions on Cardano. This move may also allow third-party developers to create a variety of apps as well as satisfy industry standards for smart contract-based infrastructure.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano goes ‘full send’ with a 50% ADA rally ahead of SundaeSwap launch ,"Cardano ( ADA ) traded within striking distance of its three-week high  at the start of this week, leading some investors to suggest that a trend reversal was in order. In reality, the bullish momentum is primarily connected to an anticipation of the upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) called SundaeSwap. ADA price rose by nearly 12% on Jan.17 to reach an intraday high of $1.60, a day after SundaeSwap  announced  the launch of its ""fully-functional beta decentralized exchange (DEX)."" Nonetheless, the upside swing also came as a part of a wider rebound trend wherein ADA jumped by almost 50% in just seven days. ADA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView In detail, ADA's rebound began  almost in sync with similar retracement moves  across the cryptocurrency market. That included Bitcoin ( BTC ), which sharply reversed its trend on Jan. 10 after its price dipped to as low as $39,650. At press time, BTC price trades at $41,500. ADA initially tailed the  crypto market's reversal , but later continued its upside momentum on its own after taking cues from the euphoria surrounding the SundaeSwap DEX launch on Jan. 20. As a result, ADA emerged as one of the best performers among the top-ten cryptocurrencies based on a 24-hour adjusted timeframe. Top 10 cryptocurrencies in the past 48 hours. Source: Messari What makes SundaeSwap bullish for ADA? SundaeSwap's official DEX launch announcement  included  evidence of greater demand for ADA tokens in the future and this is typically a bullish signal for investors. The moment we've all been waiting for has finally come! We're excited and proud to share that SundaeSwap and the ISO will be launching on the evening of Thursday, January 20th (EST)!

 The DEX platform also introduced its native SUNDAE token and discussed three ways to distribute it among users: via an initial stake offering (ISO) round,  yield farming  and direct exchange-based conversion.  Discussing the ISO round, SundaeSwap explained that it would  distribute 5% of the total SUNDAE supply  via five epochs. Each epoch represents a five-day reward cycle wherein users delegate their ADA tokens into a stake pool. ""If you want to make sure you qualify for all five ISO reward rounds, you must have ADA staked with eligible SPOs [Stake Pool Operators] before 21:45 UTC on January 25,"" the DEX's announcement read, adding: ""Your reward will be calculated based on the snapshot taken at that time, and at the same time at each subsequent epoch boundary."" Meanwhile, the yield farming program saw SundaeSwap adding four ADA-based liquidity pools: SUNDAE/ADA, LQ/ADA, WMT/ADA and CARDS/ADA. The DEX also allocated 500,000 SUNDAE per day from January through June. ADA to $2?

Pavio is a Decentraland-like virtual land startup with some 100,000 land parcels, each being  minted  as a unique nonfungible token (NFT) with coordinates. The advent of the Metaverse in the crypto sector in the past months and Cardano's involvement in it may boost demand for ADA further. Related:  Meta poaches staff from Microsoft and Apple for metaverse plans This raises the possibility for Cardano to close above its 100-day EMA resistance wave, thus shifting the next upside target toward the 200-day EMA near $2. Conversely, risks of an overall crypto market crash led by the U.S. Federal Reserve's  tapering programs  this year could spoil ADA's bullish setup to an extent.  ""While ADA is far from its peak, the prospect of obtaining more scalability as part of its 2022 roadmap explains why investors appear to be betting big on Cardano. This point was also noted by Liam Bussel, the chief marketing officer of Cardano-native DEX WingRiders in a statement to Cointelegraph. Bussel said, ""In a world characterized by high performance and novel use cases, Cardano will be able to keep up and lead the pack.

It notes that altcoins specifically are increasingly showing signs of overleveraged shorts and negative funding rates, stating that shorts liquidations might lead to a price rise. This might be possible on the condition that if BTC begins to push markets upward, altcoins that see significant short liquidations will tend to use those liquidations as rocket fuel, it says. ADA attained highs of $1.64 on Jan. 18 amid optimism around the Cardano blockchain. The ADA price suffered rejection and subsequently declined, aided by the ongoing market sell-off. However, ADA fundamentals remain quite strong as  Santiment  reports active development across the Cardano blockchain and an increase in daily active addresses (DAA). DAAs are a helpful metric to track network activity over time. In general, growing DAAs signal greater blockchain usage, while declining DAAs point to lower demand for the network.

In the process of addressing this, Node v1.33.0 was released in early January and now runs on about 80% of SPO systems. According to IOHK, technical improvements included in node v1.33.0 can be broadly categorized as RAM usage optimization and efficiency upgrades. Apart from making memory usage far more efficient than in previous versions, node v1.33.0 includes changes to the algorithms that Cardano uses to calculate rewards and stake distribution. Cardano is entering the Basho phase with a focus on optimization, scaling and network growth.  U.Today  earlier reported a proposal to increase Plutus script memory units to 12.5 million. The initial change will take effect five days after the commencement of the update proposal process, on Tuesday, Jan. 25. Improvements in Memory/CPU parameters for Plutus remain one of 11 ways that Cardano intends to scale in 2022. Other paths include block size increase, Pipelining, Input Endorsers, Node enhancements, on-disk storage, sidechains, Layer 2 Hydra scaling solution, Offloading computation and the Mithril solution.",https://u.today/cardano-increases-node-performance-to-reduce-network-congestion-during-defi-projects-rollout,utoday,2022-01-21,10:26:00,en
cardano, News ," SundaeSwap launches on Cardano, but users report failing transactions ","Cardano’s first decentralized app (DApp), SundaeSwap, has launched but is causing frustration among users due to congestion, platform errors and failed transactions. Is it just a case of expected teething troubles under an influx of excited users or is there more to it? SundaeSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and token-staking platform. Its mainnet launch on Thursday marked a milestone in the Cardano ecosystem by being the first DApp to utilize its smart contracts.  The price of Cardano’s  ADA  climbed 50% over the past week leading up to the launch of SundaeSwap, meaning a successful launch is a high-stakes game for Cardano. Trading on the DEX started at 9:45 pm UTC on Thursday. It took less than two minutes for users on the project’s Discord server to begin complaining about failed transactions and network congestion. Swapping is now LIVE!  Head on over to  https://t.co/GSGzSuqIcf  and swap tokens, deposit liquidity, and enjoy!  $SUNDAE  Token Policy ID: 9a9693a9a37912a5097918f97918d15240c92ab729a0b7c4aa144d77 #Cardano   #SundaeSwap   pic.twitter.com/jhLK6F8PuJ — SundaeSwap Labs  (@SundaeSwap)  January 20, 2022 
 
 By 10:07 pm UTC, SundaeSwap CEO Mateen Motavaf posted a message in bold font and all caps trying to address the volume of complaints on the server:  “IF YOUR ORDER IS ON-CHAIN, IT WILL BE PROCESSED ORDERS ARE FAILING DUE TO CONGESTION, PLEASE BE PATIENT.” The SundaeSwap team  hosted  a Twitter Spaces AMA at about 1 am UTC to further address any issues that traders were having with the platform. In light of the tremendous backlog of orders holding up swaps, or “scoops” as they’re called on SundaeSwap, one user asked what the expected effect of an upcoming Cardano node upgrade would have. Chief technical officer Matt Ho answered: “Once the change happens on the 25th, we expect greater than a 2X throughput increase from strictly the memory bump by itself as additional protocol parameters become available.” Another user noticed that an order was filled on the DEX before it was launched on the website. A tech-savvy trader can bypass the website user interface and execute trades directly on the underlying smart contracts for any DEX. Ho responded that “there were so many things to deal with, we didn’t believe maybe, to our naivete, that someone would have constructed a transaction by hand ahead of time.” By 2:40 am UTC, users were still complaining of failed transactions and orders pending for over four hours. Chief investment officer Pi Lanningham responded on Discord: “Orders will continue to be processed (currently around 2500 orders per hour; currently ~11k orders on chain, ~1600 of them within slippage tolerance).” The SundaeSwap team has not yet responded to Cointelegraph’s request for further comment. The core team of the project expected a large backlog of orders ahead of the launch based on the performance of the testnet about one month ago. In a Jan. 8 blog post, the team  wrote : “We want to inform you all that while orders may take days to process, everybody’s orders will be processed fairly and in the order they were received.” Related:  Cardano goes ‘full send’ with a 50% ADA rally ahead of SundaeSwap launch By using the performance of the SundaeSwap platform from a previous test phase, the team acknowledged the possibility of poor performance at first but said, “We’re very confident that the protocol can meet the normal day-to-day load once things settle down.” The Cardano blockchain  introduced smart contracts  to the platform following the Alonzo hard fork last September. Within one week, over 2,000 smart contracts were  deployed on the blockchain  with a timelock without becoming operational.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/sundaeswap-launches-on-cardano-but-users-report-failing-transactions,cointelegraph,2022-01-21,00:00:00,en

cardano, News , Cardano projects SundaeSwap and CardStarter squabble over failed promises to investors ,"The ongoing drama between two projects built on the Cardano ( ADA ) blockchain escalated across multiple social media platforms Monday, much to the dismay of the ADA community. The issues began in April when accelerator program CardStarter announced it would launch its own decentralized exchange or DEX. Shortly thereafter, its founders incentivized investors to  provide liquidity for the project on Uniswap  in exchange for native CSWAP tokens. The platform's developers landed an agreement with a third-party DEX called SundaeSwap sometime later, marketing the deal as a ""merger"" last June. As per the agreement, CardStarter would no longer develop its promised DEX, and would instead provide liquidity to the existing SundaeSwap DEX. As  told  by Reddit user Environmental-Law768, investors were later promised ""great benefits"" during a YouTube ask-me-anything session for CSWAP holders in the SundaeSwap DEX. Last week, however, it was revealed that these so-called benefits would simply be a conversion from CSWAP to CardStarter's native CARDS tokens ($3.14 at the time of writing), at a rate of 400:1. Holders who had  locked  in $15M worth of liquidity on the platform (at the time of reveal) seemed to feel this was a slap in the face, amounting to no meaningful reward for their efforts. Allegations of a rug pull soon followed. Both SundaeSwap and CardStarter  took  to social media to place blame over the investor fallout on each other — much to the disapproval of ADA enthusiasts and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. In light of SundaeSwap's announcement, we share the following documents which we feel speak for themselves. We will continue to fight for the CSWAP community.  pic.twitter.com/6oM2rdcKYF — CardStarter (@CardStarter)  January 24, 2022 
 
 According to a SundaeSwap statement cited by Hoskinson, the June deal was purely a marketing and collaboration agreement. However, the SundaeSwap team acknowledged using misguided terms on multiple occasions when communicating with users. To make matters worse, the freshly launched SundaeSwap DEX has already suffered from numerous  user reports of failed transactions .  During a YouTube stream on Monday afternoon, Cardano  founder Hoskinson  condemned  the heated exchanges between the parties. Hoskinson elaborated that it was unacceptable for the fiduciary organizations involved, SundaeSwap and CardStarter, to use Twitter, Reddit, Telegram and other channels in social media to make their case. ""It's despicable. It doesn't do anything other than try to abdicate your personal responsibility and damage the brand of the ecosystem as a whole,"" said Hoskinson, continuing: Please, people, get your shit together. Both sides come together, agree to arbitration, talk to each other, and figure out whatever the hell you agree to get done. And if you can't somehow survive the arbitration process, the courts are always available to you.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-projects-sundaeswap-and-cardstarter-squabble-over-failed-promises-to-investors,cointelegraph,2022-01-24,00:00:00,en

On Friday, Jan. 21, U.Today reported that approximately $423 million worth of crypto positions were liquidated as Bitcoin plunged to the $38,000 level and Ethereum faced a harsh drop below $3,000. At least  $70 million of those liquidations  were in Ethereum. Data shared by Chinese crypto blogger and journalist Colin Wu shows that one of the likely causes contributing to the recent Ethereum price decline was the OpenSea marketplace and NFT issuers. According to Wu, over the past 14 days, a substantial 21,000 ETH were wired from the OpenSea address to Coinbase. The amount of Ether moved to royalty distributers constituted 35,300 coins. OpenSea and NFT issuers may be one of the pressures for ETH to crash.

cardano, Sponsored , Cardano-based DeFi protocol hopes to incentivize DApp development ,"While Ethereum ( ETH ) is constantly in the news cycle regarding its upcoming  2.0 update , similar smart contract-powered platforms are slowly building up their reputations. One such network is Cardano ( ADA ), a peer-reviewed, proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain network for DApp development and decentralized finance ( DeFi ).  As developers begin deploying DeFi decentralized applications (DApps) on the Cardano platform, they’ll need the support of  layer-two solutions  to scale, remain secure and manage and incentivize their communities. ADALend is leading the charge in this regard, offering features to slowly entice users away from Ethereum and onto Cardano. A decentralized shift ADALend  is a Cardano-based lending protocol aiming to provide decentralized finance DApps with a flexible layer-two solution similar to those offered by Ethereum-based layer-two protocols. The ADALend solution will offer various lending pools, each with its own cryptocurrency. From there, users can deposit assets to the pool in return for interest, reducing the number of idle assets within the Cardano ecosystem.  The platform then supports borrowers — users who borrow amounts of said cryptocurrency by depositing another asset as collateral. The total amount of the borrowed assets is based on what they put up as collateral, alongside the assets they’ve already borrowed. More insights from ADALend  here Users can borrow funds for as long as they’d like, with partial or full payments accepted whenever. However, a borrowing position can see liquidation in the case of a significant price change. Liquidation will occur when the value of collateral drops below a pre-established threshold.  All price information is pulled from oracles, which are tied to various price providers to keep values as accurate as possible.  Belief in Cardano At this point, ADALend is more than a vision. Top venture capital firms Moonwhale Ventures, JP Maxx and even the IOHK Foundation have backed the project, believing in its goal to power the new wave of flexible financial markets on Cardano. In fact, the ADALend seed round sold out within its first hour of going live. Partly powering this popularity is the fact that ADALend is a protocol powered by users. Platform governance relies on a user-driven decentralized autonomous organization ( DAO ) in which new additions and upgrades are introduced via proposals. Users then discuss and vote on these proposals, which are then integrated into the network after the majority vote. The team hopes that its support of user control alongside fair interest rates will help drive Cardano enthusiasts to the ADALend protocol. Since its venture funding round, ADALend has worked to expand its team into developing even more features. Its next twelve months will focus on building out its current features while laying out the foundation for newer DeFi options as well. That, and the team will continue seeking out new partnerships to offer its user base an ever-expanding set of features. Learn more about  ADALend Disclaimer.

At the same time, the total value locked for the ADA blockchain reached a record of approximately $80 million, despite the  recent fall in the token's price  from the ongoing down market. The current average blockchain load of the network hovers at 93.19%, which means that 93.19% of its blocks are being filled. In context, the metric amounted to only 32.49% on New Year's Eve. The number of ADA wallets is also on the verge of breaking the 3 million mark.  Many ADA enthusiasts took to social media to celebrate the milestones. However, the phenomenon of the network nearing full capacity due to the addition of just one DEX raised questions about its utility, although  scaling solutions are coming soon . Reddit user Additional_Till_838  pointed  out: ""I dislike this because it paints a picture of Cardano's blockchain being overloaded and struggling to handle the load.

The update borders around Atomic swap, ADAX Pro, MinSwap DEX, Muesliswap, Flint wallet and others reaching significant milestones in the prior week. The launch of a Cardano-based NFT game engine was also a major highlight from the previous week. Cardano's SundaeSwap DEX also marked its first week of operation, in which it recorded $71.69 million TVL (total value locked) and more than 300 active trading pools on the exchange, as stated in a recent release. ADA, the native asset of Cardano, was down over 3.16% in the last 24 hours, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of publication, ADA was changing hands at $1.02, down 66.96% from its all-time highs of $3.10 reached in September 2021. Likewise, Cardano seems to also have been tailing Bitcoin's losses against ongoing market uncertainty. The latter remains down 45.89% from all-time highs of $69,000 at present prices. Despite the lull in price action, Cardano whales seem to be accumulating on the dip. As reported earlier by  U.Today,  Cardano whales have been actively accumulating since the massive price drop on the market was initiated on Jan. 17. Large holders, or whales, take advantage of periods of dip or macro consolidation to accumulate their favorite tokens. On-chain data from  Santiment  suggests that large Cardano addresses holding between 10,000 and 1 million ADA have increased their positions by 113%, or more than doubled their holdings by accumulating $53.6 million in tokens.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's Most Crucial Update in 2022 Goes Live: What Does This Mean for Cardano?,"Input Output Global, the development studio behind Cardano (ADA) blockchain solutions, shared the details of radical updates to its consensus structure and data process specifications. As per the dev update shared by IOG on its main blog and social media accounts, Cardano's (ADA) block size increased from 72 KB to 80KB, or by 11%. Also, every Cardano (ADA) transaction can now utilize the increased ""CPU,"" i.e., the number of Plutus script memory units. NETWORK UPDATE: Today, we have proposed the next parameter update as we continue to increase  #Cardano  network capacity in line with the plan. The proposal will increase block size by a further 8KB taking it from 72KB to 80KB.

1/9 This indicator will increase from 12.5M to 14M, allowing every transaction to leverage more resources of Cardano's decentralized computational network than ever before. Both advancements will go live on Cardano's epoch 319 on Feb. 4 at 9:44 p.m. (UTC). These enhancements are steps in Cardano's scaling roadmap designed to meet the increased requirements of its growing on-chain applications ecosystem. During the first epoch after the implementation of this novelty, the Cardano (ADA) team will closely monitor network performance as its consensus enters the Basho stage. Cardano's Basho is all about decentralization and the scalability of transaction processing for dApps and wallets. Besides that, Cardano (ADA) is on the eve of a major upgrade to its consensus layer—so called ""pipelining."" This advance completely changes the logics of Cardano's transaction propagation. Pipelining, or ""diffusion pipelining,"" allows the blockchain to overlay transaction phases instead of launching it one after another. It significantly increases the speed of transaction execution and the net transaction throughput of the network. Pipelining creates the technical basis for CPU, Plutus memory limits and block size improvements. First of all, Cardano (ADA) is set to become more attractive for high-performance dApps like decentralized exchanges and NFT marketplaces. Then, the indicators of the existing dApps will be advanced: they will work faster and in a far more resource-efficient manner.

The proposal will increase block size by a further 8KB taking it from 72KB to 80KB,” Input Output said in a tweet. Block are batches of transactions that are confirmed and recorded on a blockchain. Larger sizes mean more transactions can be included in each batch, but it can affect transaction times and overall network capacity. A separate proposal was additionally triggered to increase the performance of Plutus, the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain. Input Output said script memory units per transaction – or the amount of data that can be included in a single transaction – on Cardano would now increase to 14 million from 12.5 million. The changes are expected to improve the performance of applications built on Cardano, while increasing overall network capacity, Input Output said. The proposals are in line with a broader plan to increase transactional volumes on the Cardano network as it moves towards becoming a decentralized finance (DeFi)-focused blockchain. DeFi refers to financial services that depend on smart contracts instead of third parties. SundaeSwap, the first DeFi decentralized exchange (DEX) on Cardano, went live in January.

As of January 2021, there were only 203,519 total wallets, of which 112,469 were delegated ones.        
 
While Cardano launched smart contacts last September, there are still very few decentralized applications. The need for developers to adjust to the extended Unspent Transaction Output model (eUTXO) is a major reason for the relatively slow progress.

Input Output developers are currently working on implementing various scaling solutions during the “Basho” era of the blockchain’s development. The Kraken report points to the fact that there is a strong correction between ADA’s price action and the network’s growth.   Hence, the much-anticipated rollout of applications could prove to be another tailwind for the token.

After spending months actively recruiting for senior Haskell coders to build on Cardano, 3air was only able to obtain two entry-level part-time developers, said Bitenc. Although the company reached out to development agencies recommended by Cardano, 3air still wasn’t able to find the talent it needed. ""There are many issues we have faced,"" Bitenc told Cointelegraph in a written statement. ""One is for sure a total lack of talented Haskell and even more so Plutus developers on the market. There is also a lack of proper developer tooling and documentation that makes developing on Cardano even harder."" He further explained:  ""Additionally, Cardano uses a UTXO model that calls for new approaches to programming smart contract[s] that will not cause congestion issues. As we have seen, nobody has managed to successfully solve this issue since September’s Alonzo fork that brought smart contracts to Cardano."" By migrating to SKALE, the CEO said that 3air’s developers can begin work immediately on their development goals. He also touted SKALE’s fast transactions, zero gas fees and multichain capabilities, especially around decentralized applications, for the decision to adopt the protocol.  SKALE launched the first phase of its mainnet in June 2020 after  securing $26.75 million in funding  over the previous two years. The Ethereum-compatible network, which claims to be fully decentralized, has shifted its focus to Web3, nonfungible tokens and decentralized applications. Although Cardano has  one of the largest communities in crypto , slow progress on the development front opened door to several competitors in the smart contract space. Whereas Cardano’s developers emphasize an academic approach to development, including following the peer review process, other smart contract platforms have adopted a more iterative approach to building, testing and launching their projects. Related:  If the peer review system is broken, what the hell is the point of Cardano's reliance on it? Cardano’s choice of Haskell, a highly academic programming language, has been criticized for contributing to a slower and more difficult development process. One such criticism from within the Cardano community, dating back to November 2017,  cited  “relatively few devs” using Haskell at the time. In addition to the Haskell language barrier, Sandi Bitenc told Cointelegraph that ""the handling of tokens on Cardano"" represents an additional challenge, as it ""requires minimal ADA to be sent with any asset on Cardano."" The minimum requirement currently sits at 1 ADA, which doesn't include fees. ""While this may not be a potential issue with swaps, it will be an issue with using tokens for one-way transactions and even if this is not considered a fee, in the end, it acts as one for the end-user, making Cardano not really the cheapest regarding transaction costs."" ""We have users in Africa waiting to connect right now, so delivering quickly a low-fee, user friendly platform is of upmost importance to us,"" he said. Despite these challenges, Cardano appears to be making inroads in developing nations throughout Africa, with its development arm Input Output Hong Kong  partnering with regional governments  to improve education outcomes.  Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  believes that the continent could onboard 100 million new DeFi users by the middle of the decade. This article has been updated with additional comments from 3air CEO Sandi Bitenc.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-based-internet-company-3air-abandons-cardano-for-skale-network,cointelegraph,2022-02-08,00:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Undertakes New Proposal to Speed Up Smart Contract Platform Updates,"In a recent  Twitter  update posted by the Cardano developer and shared by Tim Harrison, IOHK communications director, Cardano seems to be working on a proposal to speed up updates to its smart contract platform, Plutus. #Plutus  Core changes to be organized around CIPs, it's all coming together ?! https://t.co/f8pDyGluBG 
 
This proposal by  @mpeytonjones  defines a process for anyone to propose changes to Plutus, with a clear path to acceptance and implementation. 
 
Open to discussion! Jump in ? This CIP, dubbed ''CIP-35,'' proposes a simpler and shorter process for making CIP proposals to change Plutus Core or its interface to the ledger. The idea around the proposal is to have a more specific and clear structure around Plutus updates and the libraries it depends on. It hopes to work on the degree of bureaucracy this adds, reducing a lengthy and complex process. Plutus is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain that allows scripting applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain. Cardano is often reputed for its ''slow and steady'' approach, which has drawn significant criticism in the past. In response to this view, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has always stated that the company's ""slow and steady"" approach to development has proven to be considerably better in the long term. Speaking on network adjustments to support future growth in late November,  IOHK says  that ''every change will be carefully considered and once actioned, subsequently monitored to gauge its impact on performance."" IOHK specifically says that it will not make changes prematurely or at a rate that could jeopardize Cardano's long-term security. It emphasizes the necessity of avoiding decisions that have a long-term impact when dealing with short-term spikes in network traffic. However, investors who demand immediate results may not appreciate its methodical approach. The ADA price remains down significantly from its all-time highs of $3.10 set in September 2021 following the anticipation of a smart contract launch. ADA is currently trading at $1.20, up 1.05% in the last 24 hours and down 61% from its all-time highs, according to  CoinMarketCap  data.",https://u.today/cardano-undertakes-new-proposal-to-speed-up-smart-contract-platform-updates,utoday,2022-02-10,12:52:00,en
cardano,No Section,Crypto Winter Has Arrived: Why Crypto CFDs Might Be a Good Option to Consider Now?,"Alarming articles about the “new crypto winter,” i.e., multi-month bear market for Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins are popping up here and there. Crypto influencers and media outlets are reiterating that all signs of “winter is coming” are present. If true, which trading strategy can help holders to come through this painful prolonged correction? And is there a reliable service that can help in implementing such a strategy? A bear market (“winter,” correction, recession) is a market situation in which the prices of the majority of assets are falling. It is accompanied by negative investing sentiment (from “fear” to “extreme fear”) and panic-driven selling. For stocks and index markets, analysts indicate the start of the bear market at which the rates are falling by 20% from the local peak. As crypto markets are far more volatile, bear markets start here only after a 45-55% decline. Both traditional and cryptocurrency markets know long-term cycles: every market will go through a bullish and bearish stage. For instance, on Bitcoin (BTC) markets, a bearish recession followed 2013 and 2017 peaks. For the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), the last prolonged bear markets took place in 2007-2009. Similar recessions were registered in March, 2020 but bulls managed to push prices higher. While we cannot be sure about whether crypto markets are already in the “bear market” phase, there are some optimistic and pessimistic theories about this trend. Mostly, analysts are sure that Bitcoin (BTC) and major altcoins have already dipped into bearish waters. As U.Today covered previously, Santiment statistics show that social media users have not been so bearish since mid-May 2021. As such, the “crowd wisdom” indicates a bearish correction. So does Chris Burniske, former ARK analyst and author of the most popular crypto asset valuation instruments. NFT volumes & prices in Jan 2022 have been strong. Many say this shows how everything in crypto may not crash simultaneously again. 
 
One could also say  #NFTs  are at the furthest end of risk, the most illiquid, and so the last to pump with the euphoric gasps of a dying bull.  pic.twitter.com/9jW27gwG9s According to him, the surprising upsurge of the NFTs market is not good for Bitcoin as it siphons liquidity from digital gold and major altcoins. For Mr. Burniske, the entire situation looks like the “ICO boom” that ended with the “crypto winter” of 2018. At the same time, the data from many on-chain analytical instruments ‘screams’ that too many large-scale holders are aggressively increasing their bags. Massive BULLISH divergence between  #Bitcoin  price and Illiquid supply. HODLers are accelerating their buys. 
 
Probably nothing... ?  pic.twitter.com/EyPaJYjfSU As per Coinmetrics, Bitcoin (BTC) holders are back to accumulating. So, the sell-off might be over which suggests the upsurge of price is on cards. Also, Bitcoin Relative Strength Indicator dropped to ‘extremely overbought’ levels unseen since ‘Black Friday 2020 in Crypto’. As the trading sphere has come through dozens of bear markets, there are a number of ready-made strategies that might prove helpful in overcoming a bearish recession with minimum losses. Increasing the share of stablecoins in the portfolio might also be a good solution for the bear market. When you are buying stablecoins, you do not need to “cash out” by withdrawing to SEPA, PayPal or other fiat accounts. With increased stablecoins bags, you will be able to either “buy the dip” in potentially promising assets or try “dollar-cost averaging” (DCA), which is generally considered as the go-to strategy for every bear market. Last but not least, bear markets rarely target all types of markets simultaneously. So, the diversification of the portfolio should be increased. Bitcoiners can try adding ETFs and real world segment stocks, while “gold bugs” can experiment on ForEx markets. Contracts for difference (CFDs) are contracts that allow traders to find potential benefits in volatility, while for others it might mean higher risks and potential losses as well. As crypto markets are the most volatile ones, trading CFDs here might bring significantly more benefits than that for stocks or commodities, but of course it might also bring losses as well considering the potential risks. When you are certain that some of your assets have entered the bear market, switching to the strategy with dominant short positions might prove to be a smart move. By opening ‘shorts’ and ‘longs’, traders can benefit from price swings in either direction. Various trading options are available with  Libertex , a Cyprus-regulated CFD broker for stocks, commodities, cryptocurrencies, ETFs, metals, indexes and ForEx (FX). Its polished UX/UI could potentially unlock some unique opportunities even amid a painful bearish recession. Libertex is a regulated trading platform for Contracts for Difference (CFDs). It means that Libertex traders can attempt to take potential advantage of price swings in either direction. So, what makes Libertex special in 2022? Libertex is the official trading partner of Tottenham Hotspur F.C., an  English Premier League football club that needs no further introduction. All positions on Libertex are available through both MT4 and MT5 interfaces as well as through the Libertex mobile app. They boast feature-rich toolkits of indicators, oscillators, time frames and so on. Trading through terminals is available with EUR, GBP, CHF and PLN. To ensure maximum resource-efficiency for all categories of traders, Libertex introduced  a completely novel architecture of fees . As of December 2021, all operations in cryptocurrencies CFD trading on Libertex platform are charged with zero commission fees. Zero exchange fees, commissions or swap fees are introduced for all positions from the crypto segment. As such, spread is the only extra expense for crypto CFD traders. This scheme is valid for all retail crypto trading clients except for U.K. traders, as CFDs on digital assets are not allowed in this jurisdiction. As the market recession after the 2020-2021 euphoria gains steam, stocks and crypto traders should adjust their strategies to new contexts. Diversification, a resource-efficient fee model and advanced trading UX/UI is one of the best choices for trading in a bear market. As such, CySEC-regulated  Libertex  is quite possibly one of the best go-to solutions for all categories of traders due to its unmatched range of assets available, user-friendly interface, large toolkit of deposits/withdrawals methods and reconsidered fee structure.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Inches Closer To Historic Update for Plutus: Details,"Cardano (ADA), the largest Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network, is close to the most radical increase of its transactional capacity. With a new upgrade, Plutus scripts will be able to leverage more computational resources of the network. According to the official announcement shared by Input Output Global, a software development studio behind  Cardano (ADA)  blockchain solutions, its crucial performance upgrade has entered its latest phase. PARAMETER UPDATE: Today, we have commenced the update proposal process to increase per-block memory units limit for  #Plutus  scripts on the Cardano mainnet. This change will take effect at the boundary of epoch 321 on 14th February at UTC 21:44:51. 
 
1/8 Starting from epoch 321, which is expected to come on Feb.14th at 09:44 pm (UTC), every Plutus script (Cardano-specific software program) will be able to harness 14 million memory units every Cardano (ADA) block instead of 12.5 million. As such, with the total CPU capacity of Cardano set at 56 million memory units per block, it is going to support 4 Plutus scripts running simultaneously by this or that dApp. Once the update is deployed and activated, the IOG team will closely monitor the performance of the network for the entire next epoch (almost 5 days). Should the increase be insufficient, IOG devs will consider further near-term advances to its design.  The upcoming upgrade is a part of  Cardano's transition towards Basho , a much-anticipated period of massive scaling improvements.  As covered by U.Today previously, in post-Basho era, Cardano (ADA) will be suitable for sophisticated B2B use-cases as its transactional bandwidth will be way higher than that of competitors.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Doubts Bitcoin Will Be World's Reserve Currency,"During  a recent interview , Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson questioned Bitcoin's ability to become the world's reserve currency. 
 
While the crypto king has the first-mover advantage, the Cardano founder believes that its growing energy consumption will be contributing to increasing centralization.  He is convinced that there is no point in using an energy-intensive process when there are more efficient alternatives. 
 
Hoskinson does not buy the claim that scarcity comes from a high cost of production, claiming that it is actually derived solely from the underlying asset's monetary policy and its utility: If you produce paintings and one you have to paint by hand while the other you can do with the machine and they both look identical, and the demand is the same for both, you are just spending a thousand times more effort to do one versus the other. A digital standard would have to offer smart contracts, metadata standards and systems with high throughput that could reach millions of transactions per second. While Bitcoin cannot provide any of these things right now, Hoskinson predicts that the original cryptocurrency could ""certainly evolve."" 
 
The cryptocurrency billionaire also said that it was ""not impossible"" for a product like  Cardano  to have the capability to become the world's reserve currency. Hoskinson predicts that  ""de-dollarization""  will continue taking place as America's national debt continues to increase, with people fleeing to different monetary standards: 
  It's just going to come down to what the nation-states feel they need.

With the current situation on the market, you can only see fairly established projects and get a shallow view of what the project is all about – no community exposure, no decision-making. 
 
Two of the biggest centralized players facing “glitches” and making “mistakes” that quite by chance become very profitable. The task is to educate the community and provide them with a transparent environment in which they will come to the conclusion through their own research and decide what is profitable and what is not without any “accidental influence”. CryptoToday is an upcoming decentralized crypto data and listing platform made by the  community  for the  community . Listing a project in the early stages of building a community takes a lot of time to get exposure and spread out the word. The project wants to get listed on a site to get validation and social proof. 
 
As centralized aggregators don’t accept payments for listings, so-called agencies came to scoop off the top. The unsavoury dark market allows those agencies to take enormous sums to “get your listing through”. Going through the agency doesn’t guarantee your listing, and the whole process is very ill-mannered. Why is CryptoToday different? What about the users who vote?  They are not left out. All users that are an active part of the CryptoToday community can earn while validating information in the given project proposals. After checking the provided information and ticking checkboxes, the user can lock his $LIST tokens into the vote. 
 
Once the voting time expires, the majority of votes are the successful ones that share the reward pool given by the project. -           The listing is extremely fast (108h at most) and fair -           No VC's -           No presale -           Everything is community-based -           Newly listed projects will instantly have high community awareness (free marketing) -           Vote 2 earn will award those who vote the most 
  On the fair launch which is scheduled for March 7th 2022 , you get 10% of the tokens, with the remaining 90% unlocked at a rate of 10% monthly,  supporting holders and proper believers in the decentralized crypto space.

The Cardano Foundation  launched  its bug bounty program in August 2021 in collaboration with HackerOne, a bug bounty platform that connects businesses with one of the world's largest communities of hackers. Human ""ethical hackers,"" according to the Cardano Foundation, are better at detecting holes in blockchains than automatic vulnerability scanners. The stress testing of its network comes as Cardano is taking continuous steps to improve its smart contracts and transaction throughput. Cardano's Alonzo hard fork ushered in the Plutus smart contract platform, paving the path for NFTs, dApps and DeFi on the  network . With the imminent launch of numerous new Cardano projects, the ecosystem will see tremendous expansion, necessitating increased security. Wormhole, a token bridge between Solana and other DeFi networks, suffered a security breach in February, resulting in the loss of 120,000 wrapped Ether (wETH) tokens valued at $322 million. The Wormhole team tried to bargain with the hacker by promising a $10 million bug reward in exchange for the return of the funds.

The number of new daily addresses being created on the  $ADA  network surged by 167% to hit 112.5K addresses. A sustained increase in this metric generally precedes a spike in price volatility for  #ADA .  pic.twitter.com/9m8tjt2U9m The analyst notes that the number of new daily addresses being created on the Cardano network has grown by nearly 167% to surpass 112,500 addresses. Sustained growth in this metric usually precedes a spike in price volatility for ADA, the analyst maintains. This may also be substantiated by recent data from  Messari ; aside from Bitcoin, Cardano is in the top place in terms of transaction activity, outpacing Ethereum. Based on transaction volume, Cardano overtook Ethereum at $15.06 billion, while the latter registered 24-hour volumes of $6.71 billion. Adjusted transaction volume is still a good way to isolate only the most important transactions. Cardano outperformed Ethereum in adjusted volumes, with a 24-hour volume of $14.26 billion, compared to the latter's $5.20 billion. In comparison to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Cardano users also paid lower fees. Cardano users only paid $54,027.47 in transaction fees in the last 24 hours, compared to $0.44 million and $25.87 million for Bitcoin and Ethereum, respectively. Cardano's SundaeSwap recently hit a milestone of over 100 million ADA traded onto weeks after launching on the market. The  ADA price  is teetering at $1.07 at press time. Several factors could contribute to an increase in the price of ADA in the medium term, as the asset is yet to reflect the favorable fundamentals of its network development. A comeback of buyers, in an optimistic scenario, might see Cardano's price hold its ground around the $1 support level and settle before another large rise. If buyers gather together, a bounce off of the $1.18 barrier might ignite a major rise. If the upsurge then lifts ADA back over $1.79, it might signify the start of a new uptrend to retest the $2 range.",https://u.today/cardano-sees-significant-growth-in-on-chain-activity-as-new-addresses-spike-167,utoday,2022-02-17,11:21:00,en

In today's world, banking has become even more complicated for various groups of people that face numerous obstacles in using traditional banking solutions; that is why Decentralize Finance platforms received even more demand recently, which plays out in the favor of such projects as ADALend. Platforms like ADALend provides users with proficient interest rates for both borrowing and lending solutions. Due to its decentralized nature, all services that users utilize on the platform cannot be attacked, taken or blocked by any centralized party, unless the entire blockchain decides to do so. Be sure to read up on this article about us right here ? ?  https://t.co/02ZIUrxux3 In comparison to centralized structures, the DeFi system is far more robust and anti-fragile, as the ADALend CEO notes. Thanks to the efficient scaling of the Cardano network, their protocol is more stable and more immune to attacks from the outside. According to Koskins, ADALend is being developed as a scalable, trustless, and decentralized lending protocol that utilizes a self-governed environment for protecting its users. It was initially chosen to build the protocol on the Cardano blockchain, as other solutions like Ethereum or Solana have numerous underlying problems that could greatly affect the user experience in a negative way. For example, the Ethereum network at some point became somewhat unusable for a certain group of traders and investors as fees for one transaction could hit hundreds of dollars as well as the exponential increase in average transaction time. Solana network, on the other hand, offers a more delicate fee structure that allows for making a large number of transactions at a low cost but, unfortunately, it has shown itself to not be the most technically stable solution on the market. Currently, ADALend is in the final stage of its private sale that ends on Feb. 28, which will be the last date for acquiring ADAL tokens at a discount. The process of a private IDO stage is somewhat similar to buying Google or Apple stocks before the IPO.",https://u.today/heres-how-adalend-revolutionizes-lending-industry-kaspars-koskins-interview,utoday,2022-02-17,07:52:00,en

Our latest performance update increased the per-block memory units limit for  #Plutus  scripts on the  #Cardano  mainnet, as we continue to improve and optimize the  #Cardano  network. 
 
From our recent mid-month update, here's  @JohnAlanWoods   https://t.co/nP3dSktHzw   pic.twitter.com/LJR74Shxeb According to Woods,  Cardano has increased  the limits of its memory units per block for Plutus scripts (Cardano-specific software programs) on Cardano mainnet. Overall, he stated that this year is dedicated to scaling Layer 1 on Cardano mainnet. Recently, substantial improvements to Cardano block size have been made. The blockchain started off with blocks of 64 Kb, then improved the size to 72 Kb and, finally, the block size was recently increased to 80 kilobytes. The next series of changes was made to the amount of memory units. Plutus requires both computational resources (CPU units) and memory units. It started with 10 million units, then this amount was increased to 11.25 million, followed by 12.5 million units. Finally, the number recently increased to 14 million memory units on Plutus. That was a 40% increase in the memory resources for Plutus scripts, as per Woods. The most recent improvement, however, has been an increase in limits for memory units in each new block. The previous improvements in memory limits were made per transaction. Both CPU and memory units have limits per block. Talking about the results of the improvement in layman's language, John Woods stated that now Plutus developers can not only write scripts that do more but can also put more of those scripts into Cardano blocks that have been made bigger. The previous increase in the per-block memory unit limit was made on Feb. 14, when the limit was raised from  50 million to 56 million per block . That allowed developers to run up to four Plutus scripts simultaneously on each block.",https://u.today/cardano-increases-per-block-memory-unit-limit-for-plutus-scripts-details,utoday,2022-02-18,15:05:00,en

U.Today helps you stay tuned into the latest crypto news and presents you with the top four news stories from the past weekend. On Friday, Ryan Zohoury, founder of Tesla Console, mentioned Elon Musk in his tweet about  Tesla charging stations  that have been recently opened in Santa Monica. In response to the news, the centibillionaire wrote that in the future, he sees Tesla charging stations accepting Dogecoin as payment. Musk also stated that Tesla plans to open “a futuristic diner/drive-in theater” in the Hollywood area, where people will be able to pay in Dogecoin as well. According to Input Output Global, the latest  Cardano update , which increased the per-block memory unit limit for Plutus scripts on the Cardano mainnet, is up and running now. On Saturday, Feb. 19, it entered observation mode. Despite this major update, ADA continues its multi-month price dropdown, changing hands at $0.95. However, participants in the Finder's panel discussion stated that by 2030, Cardano’s native asset might eclipse $58. On Friday, Whale Alert crypto tracker detected five large transactions, carrying a total of 208.6 million XRP tokens. Two of these transactions were made by  Coinbase  crypto exchange, which moved 88.6 million XRP. The other three transactions were conducted by Bittrex crypto trading company to Mexican crypto unicorn Bitso and Europe-based Bitstamp. Coinbase’s XRP transfers made some members of the Twitter crypto community speculate about the exchange readying to resume XRP trading. Coinbase suspended trading operations with XRP in January 2021 after the SEC initiated a lawsuit against Ripple. As  Ethereum  co-founder Vitalik Buterin stated in his recent interview with Bloomberg that he believes that a lot of existing cryptocurrency projects could fail during a brutal bear market. However, according to the Canadian-Russian programmer, despite cryptocurrencies going through the early stages of another crypto winter, the sustainable crypto projects that are actually building things will be able to survive it.

In a recent interview with CNBC,  Du Jun , one of Huobi’s co-founders, shared that he does not expect Bitcoin to recover anytime soon, adding that the flagship crypto’s rally might only start in 2024, the year the reward for mining Bitcoins is cut in half. According to Du, Bitcoin could be in the early innings of another bear market. Bitcoin is changing hands at $38,088 at the moment of writing. Even though it has been one year since the  Ripple-SEC  case started, the notorious lawsuit still remains the talk of the town. The latest update on the case concerns an SEC motion to reconsider 63 emails with drafts and comments about Director Hinman's lecture on ETH not being a security. According to John Deaton, founder of Cryptolaw, if Judge Sarah Netburn grants this motion, it might be the ''biggest decision'' for XRP, since XRP could be found mentioned in one of the emails, or other evidence within could be exculpatory enough to close the case. Whale Alert tracking service reported that, after remaining dormant for seven years, an  Ethereum wallet  containing $5.1 million worth of ETH has been activated. The address has made a staggering 220,799% profit, with only $2,336 as the original investment. The reason behind the sudden activity might be either someone discovering a dusty old wallet or the owner finally unlocking his or her Ether after losing access to the crypto holdings. According to data provided by Messari yesterday,  Cardano  topped Litecoin and Ethereum in terms of on-chain activity, with a transaction volume of $17.04 billion.

Delve into the world of crypto news! Eccentric centibillionaire  Elon Musk  has yet again made the Twitter crypto community wonder what he has on his mind. Yesterday, Musk posted a letter that looks very similar to “h,” but it has a horizontal line in the upper part. Opinions on what this letter could mean differ: @ShibaInuHodler account believes that it stands for “Shib,” while Huobi Global suggested its name as a possible answer. Whatever it was, the Tesla CEO has not supported any of the proposed options, leaving commentators puzzled. According to the official announcement by  ZebPay , an Indian cryptocurrency exchange, its recently launched QuickTrade feature now supports Shiba Inu, allowing for instant buying and selling of the meme cryptocurrency without paying any transaction fees. The feature was initially only available for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Polygon (MATIC). ZebPay has since introduced a slew of new cryptocurrencies, including FTX Token (FTT), the FTX cryptocurrency exchange's native token, and Dogecoin (DOGE).

Filan shared that District Judge Torres denied the SEC's motion to file a sur-sur-reply in support of its motion to strike Ripple's fair notice defense. In its request to file a sur-sur-reply to Ripple's sur-reply, the SEC refers to a similar case featuring blockchain company LBRY Inc. However, Ripple's lawyers argued that the SEC should not be permitted to use ""out-of-circuit"" examples to support its case against the company's crucial fair notice defense. Previously, LBRY joined Ripple by trying to rally with the industry against the SEC, claiming that the regulator’s enforcement actions would jeopardize other blockchain projects. Chinese crypto journalist Colin Wu reports, referring to Coinbase’s message, that after the merge between Ethereum mainnet and Beacon Chain,  ETH staking yields  are expected to rise from 4.3-5.4% APR to 9-12% APR around June of this year. The almost two-fold rise will most likely attract new investors to participate in the Ethereum staking contract that already has 1.92 million ETH. Some of them have already decided to join by transferring 28,000 ETH to the contract in a single transaction. According to  Messari’s  recent data, despite ADA’s 18% price drop, Cardano has managed to outperform the leading cryptos, Bitcoin and Ethereum, in 24-hour adjusted volume transactions. The volume of Cardano totaled $16.49 billion, while Bitcoin and Ethereum demonstrated $8.49 million and $4.73 billion volumes, respectively. Cardano users also paid cheaper fees compared to both BTC and ETH. At the moment, ADA is changing hands at $0.8742, per CoinMarketCap. The holdings of Ethereum whales continue to be filled with the most wanted cryptocurrencies.  Yesterday , WhaleStats data aggregator noticed big amounts of Polygon's MATIC and LINK being moved by three of the top 1,000 whales who hold most of their funds in the second largest cryptocurrency, Ethereum. In all, they have purchased 3.5 million MATIC and 99,990 LINK, worth $4,819,515 and $1,364,836, respectively. In the meantime, these two coins have joined the list of the 10 most purchased cryptos by the largest Ethereum whales.",https://u.today/ripple-scores-another-win-ethereum-staking-yields-to-be-doubled-cardano-tops-in-adjusted-volume,utoday,2022-02-25,16:17:00,en

This implies that assets can be sent back and forth between the two blockchains via the bridge. Users will be able to access the bridge via a MetaMask configured to connect to the Milkomeda Cardano Testnet and the Rinkeby Testnet, respectively. Future Milkomeda deployments intend to allow interoperability between Cardano, Solana and other L1 blockchains. Milkomeda will work to achieve both the sidechain and multi-blockchain interoperability visions in this way. Users holding tokens on the connected chain can move these assets to Cardano and vice versa, simply by wrapping them on the sidechain that links the two blockchains. These tokens become native assets on Cardano mainnet and perform the same functions as native assets on Cardano, once wrapped. In another development, another DEX is set to debut on the Cardano blockchain, and the  occamDEX  team announced that its development is finished and ready to be tested on the Milkomeda testnet. The team also announced the completion of its audit with HX Technologies and an upcoming mainnet release. ADA was trading at $0.83 at the time of publication, up 6.24% in the previous 24 hours. By  market value , ADA is the seventh largest cryptocurrency, with a 19.77% drop in the last seven days. After a sell-off to the $0.74 level the day before, ADA recovered to $0.868 on Feb. 25. In this recent sell-off, ADA fell below the $1 support level, which it had defended for the most part since January.

Per the document, Orbis product has all the chances to significantly advance Cardano's performance and dev experience. Enter Orbis. https://t.co/cdK3T6O8a8 https://t.co/FIKxpQQUtM Just as with other zk-based solutions, transactions on Orbis will take place off-chain and then be broadcast to Cardano's mainnet through a resource-efficient mechanism. The protocol is set to utilize zkSNARKs (Succinct, Non-interactive, ARgument of Knowledge), a type of zero-knowledge proof that does not require two-way interaction between on-chain and off-chain modules. As per the statement, the team is requesting $1 million in funding to develop and launch Orbis on Cardano (ADA). The protocol team is lead by Ryan Matovu, a founder of Ardana, which is Cardano's first stablecoin and DeFi hub. As covered by U.Today previously, Ardana made headlines with its decentralized Cardano-Near bridge. Cardano's Orbis will leverage Halo 2, a technology developed and stress-tested by mainstream privacy-focused blockchain ZCash (ZEC).

Yesterday, U.Today  reported  that ADA's Relative Strength Index has entered the extremely oversold zone by dropping below values of 30. Whenever an indicator shows that the assets are oversold, a short-term rebound should be expected by the market. In the case of ADA, the recovery came even earlier than expected, with the token gaining back at least 10% of its value in the last 24 hours. But at the same time, the recovery is purely speculative, with no major resistance points being broken. At press time, ADA trades at $0.8 and still moves in the amplitude downtrend that has caused at least a 70% loss for all Cardano investors. Luna remains among the leaders of the current rally with a 25% price increase in the last 24 hours. Yesterday,  LUNA  plunged by 16% and reached a 200-day moving average, which could have caused an even stronger drawdown. At press time, Luna trades at $64 and breaks through the 50-day moving average, which is usually considered the first signal of the beginning of the mid-term uptrend on the market. Despite showing more down-to-earth performance, Solana was still able to gain almost half of the value it lost yesterday.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Increases Focus on Interoperability Amid New Investment: Details,"EMURGO , the commercial arm of the Cardano blockchain, has disclosed an investment in Fourier Labs, an interoperability solutions provider. This comes as Cardano's focus on interoperability grows. #EMURGO  announces an investment in Fourier Labs, a  #Cardano  interoperability solutions provider, through its investment subsidiary EMURGO Ventures. 
 
Full Announcement:  https://t.co/LDv2TU1p6H $ADA   pic.twitter.com/LfQ9iODVxP The latest investment intends to develop Fourier Protocol on Cardano, an interoperable, Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible solution that would accelerate the migration of EVM-based projects to the Cardano ecosystem. Cardano also plans to employ Fourier Labs' interoperability solutions to strengthen its dApp and user adoption by lowering transaction fees, increasing scalability and security. According to  Defi Llama , DeFi adoption is on the upswing, with approximately $200 billion in TVL (Total Value Locked) across all of the main DeFi protocols. In just two years, this represents an almost 240% gain. The main user onramp for DeFi is decentralized exchanges (DEX), although many of them now demand higher transaction fees. Reduced transaction fees as a built-in feature of Fourier Labs' interoperability solutions might allow Plutus-based smart contracts and EVM Solidity-based smart contracts to be fully deployed on Cardano, increasing adoption. Cardano recently took the lead in adjusted transaction volumes, as reported by  U.Today , and Cardano users also paid lower fees than users on rival networks. Milkomeda, a Layer 2 Protocol that delivers EVM functionality to non-EVM blockchains, has announced the creation of a Cardano-Ethereum bridge testnet in partnership with the Nomad protocol. As a result, assets can be transferred between the two blockchains through the bridge. Interoperability between Cardano, Solana and other L1 blockchains remains a future goal of other Milkomeda deployments. Cardano remains at the foothills of the Basho Stage, hence, scaling remains another focus for the blockchain. To achieve scaling in 2022, the path Cardano intends to take includes block size increase, pipelining, input endorsers, improvements in memory/CPU parameters for Plutus, and others.",https://u.today/cardano-increases-focus-on-interoperability-amid-new-investment-details,utoday,2022-02-26,15:00:00,en

Thanks to a partnership with philanthropic startup The Giving Block, The Glenrose Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation started accepting  donations in several cryptocurrencies , including Shiba Inu. Taking this step seems logical to GRHF CEO Mark Korthuis since the organization is focused on technology and research. Korthuis predicts that cryptocurrencies will end up playing “a more significant role” in the world. Making donations in crypto is easy: one only needs to create a new account on the Giving Block website and select a certain cryptocurrency from a drop-down menu. On Saturday , to the great delight of XRP enthusiasts, the Ripple-affiliated coin saw a 10% rise, according to CoinMarketCap data. The reason for the upsurge is attributed to rising investor optimism amid the latest updates in the SEC lawsuit, as well as to an overall crypto market recovery. Meanwhile, according to James K. Filan, Ripple and the individual defendants have filed their opposition to the SEC's Motion for Partial Reconsideration and Clarification of Judge Netburn's DPP Ruling. Attorney Jeremy Hogan believes Ripple's recent move might be ''the hardest hitting brief'' on the SEC. According to DeFiLIama, the capitalization of DeFi products on the  Cardano  network skyrocketed after the full release of the SundaeSwap platform. Cardano has also seen a rapid increase in total value locked (TVL) from approximately $70 million to $117 million. The increased usage of the network has positively affected ADA as it managed to bounce from the local bottom and even reach the $1 resistance point. As of now, ADA is trading at $0.88, according to CoinMarketCap. As announced by DogeWhaleAlert Twitter account on Saturday,  Robinhood  is currently holding an eye-popping 42.4 billion DOGE worth $5.4 billion, which comprises almost 32% of the total supply in circulation.

First loans to Kenyan SME’s went out over the weekend. Looking forwards to turning this into a product soon so any Cardano holder can generate yield that’s uncorrelated to crypto whilst making impact.  #Realfi Cardano's RealFi, like DeFi, aims to create a product and technology ecosystem that reduces the friction between crypto liquidity and real-world economic opportunities. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  revealed  that the company plans to introduce peer-to-peer (P2P) lending across Africa this year, starting with Kenya. This, he believes, is part of an effort to close the gap between industrialized and developing countries. During a YouTube Livestream from his home in Colorado in late December 2021, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson discussed the disadvantages of decentralized finance, noting that many users are incredibly frustrated by the low production quality of applications within the DeFi ecosystem. He also mentioned Cardano's aspirations to ""build a financial operating system"" in 2022, which will deliver DeFi services to Africans, as many African countries currently lack financial inclusion. He noted that Africa has always been a priority for Cardano and that the project intends to expand its influence in the region. He said, ""My goal for the second half of 2022 is to figure out how to put all the pieces together to get an end-to-end microfinance transaction on Cardano."" ""So that a real person in Kenya or somewhere with a blockchain-based identity and credit score, stablecoin on the other side, Cardano is the settlement rail. Peer-to-peer, person-to-person, click a button, the loan goes to them. They pay it back, (and it) goes to the other side,” the IOHK CEO mentioned. In 2021, Cardano inked major partnerships in Africa, such as one with the Ethiopian Ministry for Education to create a national attainment recording system and one with World Mobile in Tanzania to enable access to essential online services through blockchain. In a  blog post , Cardano's parent firm, IOHK, described these partnerships as a ""launchpad"" for Cardano's goal to build RealFi. The word ""realFi"" was defined by IOHK as real finance that is focused on people who genuinely need new ways to access finance, producing that real value frequently lacking from DeFi, and also intends to deliver attractive yields to crypto holders, as well as cheaper credit/financial goods for real people.",https://u.today/cardanos-peer-to-peer-p2p-lending-in-africa-gains-traction-with-first-set-of-loans-disbursed,utoday,2022-02-28,13:11:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Might Reach $1 Billion in TVL at Year-End as Metric Grows: Details,"According to  Defillama , a DeFi TVL aggregator, Cardano's total value locked has surpassed its previous high of $130 million set last month. At the time of writing, the proof-of-stake blockchain's live TVL was around $132.52 million. When staked governance tokens are included in the TVL valuation, the Defillama dashboard reveals that Cardano's TVL is much greater. With the change, Cardano's TVL now stands at about $215.55 million. SundaeSwap has the highest TVL of the Cardano decentralized exchanges, Defillama monitors. With approximately $114.97 million in TVL, SundaeSwap retains a 53.51% market share. In the last month, the TVL of the first Cardano-based DEX has increased by roughly 69.98%. @MinswapDEX  started to increase TVL market share quite rapidly.

Overall, Cardano tops in on-chain activity, leading in 24-hour transaction volumes and adjusted transaction volumes as well. Cardano outperformed lead cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum, which recorded $36.38 billion and $7.42 billion, respectively. Adjusted transaction volume remains a good way to isolate only the most important transactions. Cardano outperformed lead cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum in adjusted transaction volumes, with a 24-hour volume of $41 billion compared to Bitcoin's $13.83 billion and Ethereum's $5.94 billion. Alongside this, the Cardano blockchain reported a massive rise in large transactions greater than $100,000 in the last 24 hours. Per  IntoTheBlock  data, the number of Cardano's large transactions has risen nearly 83% over the past day to 6,715. Large transactions are those in which the amount transferred exceeds $100,000, according to IntoTheBlock. The on-chain volume of these transactions gives an idea of the amount whales and institutional players transact on a given day. 
  
Increases in the volume of large transactions indicate increased activity among institutional buyers and sellers. As  U.Today  previously reported, Cardano continues to see accumulation as large addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million tokens bought more than 16,000,000 ADA as the price neared the $1 mark on March 1. In similar news, decentralized  Cardano -based exchange AdaSwap has secured $2.6 million in funding from such investors as Pluto Digital, GBV Capital, iAngels, Finova Capital and Banter Capital. Israeli actress Gal Gadot, who became an international superstar with ""Wonder Woman"" in 2018, is among angel investors who have put their money into the project.

Bashoswap is developing a Cardano accelerator and native token exchange platform that would connect early-stage Cardano developers with early adopters. Technically,  Bashoswap  merges the designs of a token launchpad and decentralized crypto exchange on Cardano (ADA). As such, it allows for conversion between ADA and other Cardano-based assets. It is difficult for most people to trade tokens on Uniswap because of high gas costs, slow transaction confirmation times and overlapping liquidity, making developers looking for other blockchains to build and launch their blockchain projects. Bashoswap was introduced by a group of blockchain professionals in late 2021. Its development is spearheaded by seasoned crypto entrepreneur Mr. Beri Ardas. To some extent, Bashoswap will adapt the mechanisms already known on flagship decentralized platforms, like PancakeSwap (CAKE) and Uniswap (UNI). At the same time, its functions will be adapted according to Cardano’s EUTXO model. Uniswap, an Ethereum blockchain token exchange technology, is one of the most important and widely used instruments. It is difficult for most people to trade tokens on Uniswap because of high gas costs, slow transaction confirmation times and overlapping liquidity. Bashoswap is now running a  private sale whitelist  for early adopters who want to participate in the initiative. BASH token also goes live as a core element of Bashoswap’s tokenomic design. It will be integrated into various Cardano-based decentralized applications. Users will be able to stake BASH tokens and utilize them in yield farming in pairs with mainstream Cardano native assets. It is also planned to utilize BASH tokens as governance assets to let its holders have a say in crucial Bashoswap referendums. BASH will be required to participate in upcoming token sales on Bashoswap’s launchpad. Last but not least, BASH will serve as an instrument to reward ADA stakers on Bashoswap.",https://u.today/cardano-based-defi-project-bashoswap-developing-a-launchpad-and-dex,utoday,2022-03-04,14:38:00,en

Y'all funny. As per his estimations, on average, Sundaeswap (SUNDAE) handles cross-asset swaps in less than one minute. This period can be compared to Ethereum-based and BSC-based top-tier DEXes Uniswap (UNI) and Pancakeswap (CAKE). He also mocked the skepticism of Cardano's crticics who predicted that Cardano's DeFi ecosystem would not get rid of the troubles it faced upon smart contracts launch. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) skeptics repeatedly announced that due to the limitations of its EUTXO model, it will not be powerful enough to host modern DeFi infrastructure. Sundaeswap (SUNDAE) is one of the earliest DeFi protocols in Cardano's ecosystem. It boasts a cross-asset swap module, yield farming instruments and other DeFi tools.

Decentralization and options matters folks. https://t.co/rlm1rEg5N5 At issue in the ConSenSys audit is the valuation of key pillars of the Ethereum ecosystem, including MetaMask and Infura.

According to the official statement by the  Ravendex  team, the service now supports staking options. In the inaugural releases of this instrument, the staking of the RAVE token, a core native utility and governance asset of Ravendex, is available. Ravendex Stake Pool: Infrastructure https://t.co/l9X2ws1Bqt A 12% annualized percentage rate is now offered for RAVE stakers. By press time, the net number of tokens staked surpassed 100 million RAVE, which indicates significant interest in Ravendex's staking opportunities among Cardano (ADA) ecosystem enthusiasts. In the DeFi segment, staking refers to a practice when crypto owners ""lock"" their riches in this or that service in order to obtain periodic rewards. New-gen decentralized services like Ravendex (RAVE) distribute rewards periodically in a noncustodial manner through smart contracts. As U.Today covered previously, Ravendex unveiled its graphic interface frontend design in Q4, 2021. To celebrate development progress and community building milestones, Ravendex also  launched  a number of giveaways. Besides that, representatives of Ravendex announced a novel form of fundraising, i.e., Initital Staking Pool Offering (ISPO). It is set to introduce decentralized token sale (IDOs) principles to the community of ADA stakers. In ISPO, participants should lock their ADA tokens in favor of a specific staking pool associated with this or that fundraiser. For doing so, they are awarded with the ISPO organizer’s native tokens. With Ravendex, people are invited to lock their ADA into the RAVEP stake pool. All rewards will be transferred to contributors in the form of RAVE tokens. A total of 66,560,000 RAVE is allocated for an ISPO initiative by the Ravendex team. ISPO will be opened for 32 Cardano (ADA) epochs between Epoch 320 and Epoch 352. For every ADA token staked, Ravdendex supporters will get 0.0325 RAVE per epoch. ADA holders can stake their tokens with either Yoroi or Daedalus wallets in a totally decentralized manner. Despite a major pullback, crypto markets are optimistic about Ravendex’s progress and its staking program launch. On the first day of the staking program, RAVE/USDT prices on major exchanges jumped from $0.003 to $0.0045, witnessing a more than 50% upsurge. Based on RSI, MAs and Bollinger Bands indicators, traders and analysts foresee that the RAVE price can surge to even more impressive numbers. It should be noted that the coin witnessed its all-time high on Dec. 25, 2021, over the $0.024 level. Ravendex (RAVE) is building an all-in-one decentralized finance protocol (DeFi) with an AMM-powered DEX for various use cases in the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem. Ravendex’s toolkit of products includes a noncustodial wallet for Cardano’s assets, a decentralized crypto conversion system, a ""yield farming"" module and, most recently, a staking ecosystem for RAVE tokens. Besides that, Ravendex will have its own stablecoin module and full set of instruments for decentralized lending/borrowing of ADA and other major Cardano-based cryptocurrencies. Its DEX went live in January 2022, prior to the announcement of the start of ISPO.

Nonetheless, he adds that completely overtaking Ethereum and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), a software platform to create decentralized applications (DApps), would be hard due to first-mover advantage. ""The EVM’s advantage has been so great that major competitors use or bridge to the EVM, rather than try to compete head-to-head without this capability,"" Dunleavy wrote, adding:  ""Even competitors that held out like Solana and Cardano have recently added or are adding EVM compatibility (Terra being the notable exception). In many cases, the EVM has already cemented itself through its network effects."" But most of  the so-called ""Ethereum killers,"" except Terra , have fared far worse so far in 2022 when faced with geopolitical conflicts, energy crises and rate hike risks.  For instance,  Solana and Cardano dropped by more than 50% year-to-date  versus Ether's 30% price decline. Avalanche price dropped by 37% in the same period. Can Ethereum regain market share?  Not everyone expects Ethereum's TVL market share downtrend to continue, however. Marcus Sotiriou, an analyst at GlobalBlock, anticipates that  Ethereum will regain its dominance  as it switches to proof-of-stake later this year from its current proof-of-work protocol. ""This is because it should dramatically reduce the cost of transactions on the Ethereum network, which is currently Ethereum's main drawback,"" he  told Business Insider  earlier this month. As of now, Ethereum works on a surge-pricing model, leading to highly volatile transaction fees. In August 2021, the network underwent a so-called "" London hard fork "" that employed a key EIP-1559 protocol. In particular, the EIP-1559 allows  the Ethereum protocol to burn gas fees , meaning that a portion of Ether's supply goes out of circulation permanently.

""Bitcoin and Ethereum remain in early adoption days, with increasing demand vs. declining supply and related price implications,"" explained McGlone, adding:  ""Our bias is why complicate it — unless something unlikely reverses the proliferation of the nascent technology, prices should rise.""

cardano,No Section,Cardano Creator Invests in Reviving Woolly Mammoths,"Charles Hoskinson , the founder of the Cardano blockchain, has backed Colossal, a biotech start-up that wants to resurrect the woolly mammoth. 
 
The ""de-extinction"" company has an ambitious goal to bring the majestic animal back from extinction by 2027 with the help of the cutting-edge CRISPR gene-editing technology. 
 
George Church, a Harvard Medical School professor, launched Colossal together with technology entrepreneur Ben Lamm in September 2021 after initially raising $15 million in seed funding. Hoskinson participated in the start-up's recently announced $60 million Series A led by Legendary Entertainment CEO Thomas Tull. Crypto-friendly socialite Paris Hilton also invested in Colossal, along with a slew of venture capital firms. 
 
There have been years of research into how to revive an extinct species by juxtaposing DNA samples retrieved from fossils with those of their modern counterparts. Church has spent more than 10 years working to bring the woolly mammoth to life. The gene-editing pioneer continues to work on a mammoth embryo that will be based on the elephant genome. 
 
Where does crypto fit into ""de-extinction?"" Hoskinson claims that blockchain can be utilized for crowdfunding and intellectual property (IP) management.  Colossal's founders have repeatedly stressed that their objective is to reverse the biodiversity collapse that has taken place on Earth. They also potentially plan to tackle the melting of permafrost. 
 
Some critics, however, warn that the resurrection of extinct animals comes with various ethical concerns. Others say that it would be more prudent to invest in preserving endangered species.

cardano, News , Charles Hoskinson under fire for... not dropping out of a Ph.D. program? ,"A debate has surfaced online following claims that Cardano founder and Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson may have fudged the specifics of his educational background.  While the issue is hardly a major scandal, it concerns conflicting reports around whether Hoskinson dropped out of a Number Theory-focused Ph.D. program — as he suggested — or if he embellished the story. Crypto journalist and Unchained Podcast host Laura Shin suggested in her new book and on social media that  he never finished an undergraduate degree  or enrolled for a Ph.D.  The dispute started on Sunday after a Twitter user stated they were reading Shin’s book “The Cryptopians” to get a rundown of the early days of Hoskinson and Cardano as reported in the book. Hoskinson responded to the post by stating: “Great work of fiction. Tough market to beat George R.R. Martin and Tolkien, but we wish her well.” Shin promptly fired back at Cardano‘s founder , as she questioned “speaking of fiction, do you want to address the discrepancies between your claims of dropping out of a PhD program and the schools‘ assertions that you were enrolled as an undergrad?”  The journalist’s book was launched on Feb. 22. In it, she stated that she contacted both the Metropolitan State University of Denver “which doesn’t have a graduate math program” and the University of Colorado, where Hoskinson previously studied. According to Shin, both institutions stated that the Cardano founder studied as an undergraduate, but didn’t earn a degree from either.  “The schools say he didn’t graduate from undergrad. Also, he has said multiple times, including in our interview, that he dropped out from a PhD program.” Shin also noted that she gave Hoskinson and his team “ample opportunity” to talk with her and provide their perspective, but they all ghosted her. Commenting on the thread, BitTorrent founder Bram Choen  chimed in jokingly  that she could also let everyone know that he “dropped out of undergrad,” too.  Feel free to let everyone know that I dropped out of undergrad — Bram Cohen (@bramcohen)  March 8, 2022 
 
 The community debated whether Hoskinson’s wording about not completing a Ph.D. could be technically true, but a little misleading. However, Shin also pointed to an interview with him where he explicitly said he dropped out of a Ph.D. program.  During the interview, Shin asked Hoskinson whether he was getting a master‘s or a Ph.D. when he first heard about Bitcoin. The founder stated that:  “Yeah, I was a grad student. I was trying to get a PhD and I ended up dropping out and never finished.” He didn’t say he dropped out of a PhD program. You’re putting words in his mouth, clearly. Also, Gates, Zuckerburg, etc. all college drop outs. We care about tech not small conversations  @laurashin — McLovin ADA (@RubbishBullocks)  March 6, 2022

cardano, Research , Does the future of DeFi still belong to the Ethereum blockchain?  ,"Ethereum is a decentralized finance giant that has seen significant growth over the past few years, spurred on by events like “DeFi Summer” and the rise of nonfungible tokens (NFTs).  Ethereum’s popularity, however, may be leading to its downfall, as other protocols look to eat away at or completely consume its market position.  Bitcoin and the birth of Ethereum  Bitcoin ( BTC ) is the mother of all blockchains and was the first modern iteration of what is widely known today as cryptocurrency. Since then, there have been numerous attempts to provide users greater functionality, but most have not had the staying power. One that has risen to the challenge is Ethereum, with its native Ether ( ETH ) coin now the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  Cointelegraph Research has released a 74-page report that does a deep dive into Ethereum’s rise to this position, starting off by examining Bitcoin alongside Ethereum’s history and where it is today. Ethereum provided users with a way to create smart contracts in a way Bitcoin could not, which helped propel Ethereum to its current status as the leading blockchain for DeFi. It’s clear that Bitcoin is here to stay, and there have been advancements in its DeFi capabilities — mostly utilizing layer-2 solutions to help scalability, such as Lightning Network, Portal and DeFiChain. However, Ethereum is still out in front of Bitcoin in the DeFi space, but can it stay there? The current strengths and weaknesses of Ethereum  Ethereum saw unprecedented adoption in 2021, peaking at 800,000 daily active users in November. It has real-life adoption use cases, with a total value locked of over $150 billion across DeFi applications running on the blockchain in 2021. Some of the services offered by decentralized applications on Ethereum include lending, derivatives, asset management, stablecoins, trading and insurance. However, due to the increasing adoption of the blockchain over the past several years, its popularity is also its curse.  Download the full report here, complete with charts and infographics. The more the network is used, the more congested it gets and the higher the transaction costs, also known as gas fees, subsequently become. These fees are there to help incentivize the network’s miners to engage with the proof-of-work consensus mechanism it utilizes. There is an answer to the congestion and scaling issue, and that is Ethereum’s switch to proof-of-stake and other upgrades in its full transition to what is known colloquially as Ethereum 2.0. However, delays in going live with the various stages of Eth2’s full rollout, combined with the rising popularity of other smart contract blockchains, could knock the crown off of Ethereum’s head.  New kids on the block  There are plenty of blockchain protocols out there trying to climb to the top of the crypto charts. In recent years, only a few have shown strong adoption, popularity and real-world use cases, and they are starting to get attention from some in the blockchain space who would normally go to Ethereum. Cointelegraph Research’s report dives into three of these blockchains: Solana, Polkadot and Algorand. Each protocol’s history, unique characteristics, ecosystem and potential to scale are explained in detail to help determine if any of these chains have what it takes to be the “Ethereum Killer.” Solana reports that it can process over 50,000 transactions per second (TPS), but the network has yet to reach these levels, though it still provides faster transaction speeds than Ethereum at a small fraction of the cost per transaction. Polkadot brings interoperability to the picture, allowing various chains to work seamlessly together. However, this has not been fully launched yet, and it is unclear how Polkadot will function when it really counts in the real world. Algorand is a blockchain created by some of the best minds in cryptography, with high TPS, low network fees, and no downtime history. Its adoption metrics show a slow but steady pace — will that strategy be a winning one in the end? Solana, Polkadot, and Algorand operate very differently from one another, and each offers advantages over Ethereum in its current form. While it is true that the future may be multichain and complete with paths toward interoperability, only the best can dominate in the DeFi space — which one will it be? Can Ethereum hold its position in 2022 and beyond?  Ethereum has some stiff competition in the likes of Solana, Polkadot and Algorand. Each provides solutions to Ethereum’s current issues. If the full rollout of Eth2 is not executed well or continues to be delayed, these up-and-coming protocols would be happy to take Ethereum's place as King of DeFi.

Don’t miss anything important in the crypto world! Tesla CEO  Elon Musk  is known for his love of memes, as well as for his mysterious posts on Twitter. Yesterday, he combined the best of two worlds by posting a relatively old Satoshi-related meme, in which the names of the largest Asian companies (Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi and Motorola) are combined together, forming “Satoshi Nakamoto.” Most of Musk’s followers enjoyed the joke, but some went as far as assuming that he is hinting at Satoshi's background, suggesting that he is not Japanese but Korean and American mixed. John Deaton , founder of the firm Cryptolaw, has shared yet another opinion on how the Ripple-SEC case would develop. In his recent tweet, Deaton wrote that Ripple's expected court rulings might come down as soon as the end of March, referring to “the 6 months list,” i.e., a list of motions pending for 6 months or longer that is submitted by the judges to Congress twice per year. According to Deaton, the next list is due March 31, and if Judge Torres does not issue a ruling on the pending motions, she must report those motions for inclusion on the six-month list.

-Keep buying/hope for cheaper prices A Twitter user asked Brandt how long he has been bullish on Bitcoin, and the seasoned  trader answered  that he has been bullish on BTC for years. However, he tries to be honest and share not only bullish signals when charts reveal them. Curiously, in early March this year, Brandt tweeted that he was against ""hodling"" Bitcoin.  He wrote  that the asset has had four declines of roughly 80%, and hodlers had to wait for a 400% recovery to reach the previous all-time high. In the thread, the trader received numerous questions from commentators. Answering one of them, Brandt wrote that aside from Bitcoin, he believes in stocks more than in cryptocurrencies, saying that ""crypto is still unproven"" and that he prefers quality stocks over it. He recommends  avoiding the majority of altcoins, as well as NFTs (""jpgs""). I am also very favorable toward rental income property. Between quality stocks and crypto I prefer quality stocks. Crypto is still unproven IMO. Avoid 8hitcoins and jpgs. Hope for a bear market so that stocks can be bought cheaply.

Large transaction spikes are frequently associated with increased activity from institutional players, or whales, who are either buying or selling. These transactions exceed $100,000 moved, according to IntoTheBlock. The ADA price is now attempting to recover after plunging to lows at $0.78 on March 11. At the time of publication, ADA was trading at $0.792 as per  CoinMarketCap  data. Cardano remains down 74.35% from all-time highs of near $3 reached in September 2021. Large investors, known as whales, appear to be bargain hunting as the Cardano network hints at significant development. It might be worth noting that every market cycle has an accumulation phase, during which prices flatten and contrarian investors see an opportunity to buy at a discount. When this market cycle is finished, the next one, the ""Mark-Up Phase,"" begins. This refers to a phase in which the market has been stable for a while and is beginning to move higher. Bitrue (BTR), a cryptocurrency exchange, has  announced  yet another significant addition to its trading pairs based on Cardano (ADA).

As the website suggests, 3,494,888 million wallets are currently registered on the network, which means that during the next week, the number of  wallets  will most likely exceed 3.5 million. But while there are close to four million wallets on the network, only a small part of these entities remain active. According to Messari, only 136,800 wallets are active. Such a small number of active wallets suggests that the majority of Cardano users are simply holding the cryptocurrency instead of utilizing it actively. As for the holder distribution on the network, the largest group of wallets owns from $1 worth to $100 worth of Cardano. The number of whales on the network that own more than $10 million worth of coins equals 393 wallets, which is considered insignificant. The dominance of retail traders and investors on the coin's network makes it more unstable and usually causes a spike in selling pressure amid short-term price rallies. This occurs as the majority of holders at a loss prefer selling at the breakeven point rather than holding out for profit in the future. As the In/Out of the Money indicator on IntoTheBlock suggests, Cardano remains one of the least profitable assets on the cryptocurrency network with less than 6% of all  ADA  holders making profits from their investments. Such a low profitability rate is caused by the asset's price action, which remains unstable since the ATH reached back in August.

According to DeFi Llama's rankings of decentralized finance platforms, Cardano is currently in a distant 28th place. While its total value locked (TVL) has nearly doubled over the past month, it is far from catching up with other major “Ethereum killers,” such as Terra, BSC, Avalanche and Solana. Presently, there’s only a few functioning applications on  Cardano . MuesliSwap became the first decentralized exchange to launch on the mainnet in late December. SundaeSwap, the most anticipated Cardano project to date, was off to a rocky start, with users experiencing technical issues due to severe network congestion. Presently, the top Cardano DEX has a modest $114.35 million in total value locked. Minswap, which made its debut earlier this week, has $63.72 million.

To keep you informed, U.Today has prepared the top four news stories from the past weekend. Last Friday, the  Ripple-SEC  case yet again made headlines, as judge Analisa Torres denied Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse and co-founder Chris Larsen's  twin motions  to dismiss the regulator’s lawsuit. In addition, the judge also denied the SEC's motion to strike the fintech giant's ""fair notice"" defense. In his latest tweet, Garlinghouse described the ""fair notice"" ruling as a ""huge win"" for the defendants, though he left no comments on his failed motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The SHIB Super Store Twitter account  has announced  that they have prepared to add another huge amount of SHIB to the burn pot - 140,712,694 canine coins, or $3,159 in fiat equivalent. By now, the total amount of SHIB to be destroyed at the March 15 burn event equals roughly 655,216,510. Meanwhile, the shibburn team reported that according to etherscan, last Saturday, about 11.06 million tokens were shifted to dead addresses. Peter Schiff , CEO of Euro Pacific Capital and a major Bitcoin critic, decided to explain to his Twitter followers why he believes billionaire Paul Tudor Jones was wrong about the flagship crypto, calling it the best inflation hedge. Schiff claims Bitcoin is not “the fastest horse in the race,” as the founder of Tudor Investment Corporation called it since, over the past year, BTC plunged by 37%, while gold, on the other hand, spiked by 12%. Charles Hoskinson , founder of the Cardano blockchain, has taken to Twitter to comment on the growth of the ecosystem.

The upgrade is expected to take place this June. With over 517 projects building on Cardano, the network has hit several milestones in recent months - for instance in total value locked (TVL). The overall value of crypto assets placed in a decentralized finance (DeFi) system - or DeFi protocols in general - is referred to as total value locked (TVL). According to  data  from DefiLlama, the total value locked in the Cardano ecosystem is currently $192.5 million. The DefiLlama dashboard demonstrates that Cardano's TVL is substantially higher when staked governance tokens are included in the TVL valuation. With the inclusion, Cardano's TVL now stands at about $275.9 million. IOHK  indicated in a blog post that it intends to group multiple code releases to improve delivery predictability for the Cardano ecosystem as more decentralized apps (DApps) and exchanges (DEXs) launch in the coming months. The company says it plans to roll out a slew of scaling improvements in 2022, with an emphasis on hard fork combinator (HFC) events in June and October. Pipelining, new Plutus CIPs, UTXO on-disk storage and Hydra are among the core parts of its scaling plan. In the context of Cardano, a hard fork combinator is meant to allow the combination of multiple protocols, without requiring significant changes. When paired with parameter adjustments, these improvements aim to increase Cardano's throughput and optimize the system to handle an increasing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, smart contracts and DEXs.

In the last seven days, the total value of funds locked in Cardano smart contracts increased by more than $65 million. A strong spike in the value of locked funds is most likely tied to the redistribution of funds that have not existed on the network before. Prior to the launch of Minswap, SundaeSwap dominated the network with over 97% dominance over the total value locked. At press time, SundaeSwap holds $114 million of locked ADA. Minswap's TVL stays at $107 million, while projects in third and fourth places combined hold less than $2 million of users' funds. Following the spike in TVL, ADA's price has also reacted with positive price movement totaling 6.6% growth in the last 24 hours. While the increase has not broken any major resistance, it still moved through the trendline formed since the middle of March. As for the long-term trend, ADA is still moving in the sharp downtrend that caused almost a 70% loss for most Cardano holders. The total value of funds locked on the  network  is a direct reflection of the usage of smart contracts and various solutions on the network. Blockchains like Ethereum and Solana had their run in 2021 with the huge help of  decentralized projects  and applications that created a demand for the digital currency.

Cardano topped the most developed assets in 2021,  U.Today  previously reported. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently  shared the good news  of the first Hydra Heads launching on the public Cardano testnet. Hydra Heads, the first in a suite of protocols, is a critical element in Cardano's scaling journey. Hydra refers to a collection of Layer 2 solutions aimed at improving network security and scalability. With the release of smart contracts technology for the Cardano blockchain, more developers have started to utilize the network and release various use cases. Cardano's total value locked, or TVL,  continues to grow. According to the DeFi LIama tracking service, $223 million is currently locked in various contracts built on the Cardano network. With the inclusion of staking, Cardano's TVL is greater and stood at $313 million at press time. Although the groundwork for future improvements in the Cardano ecosystem has been built, the ADA price has failed to catch up, as it remains down nearly 75% from its all-time high of $3.10. ADA is presently trading in a tight range at $0.85, hinting at an upcoming major price movement.

Stay tuned for what’s on the crypto industry’s agenda! RippleNet’s general manager, Asheesh Birla, has recently been very pleased with its growth. As he recounted in the episode of “The Ripple Drop” published this Thursday, Ripple’s flagship  On-Demand Liquidity  (ODL) product is close to achieving “global coverage” and is currently operating in 22 destination markets. In the meantime, in response to Ripple’s demand to bring new innovative use cases to their customers, Birla is working with RippleX to figure out new opportunities in the NFT space. He states that  the NFT market could be bigger than anything the crypto community has seen so far in terms of adoption. Unlike average investors that would most likely avoid purchasing and even trading  Shiba Inu , whales and large wallet owners think differently. Yesterday, an anonymous whale decided to follow the top 500 Ethereum wallets that have been grabbing SHIB tokens for the last couple of days and bought 271 billion canine coins worth more than $6 million. The purchase coincided with the token’s 5% recovery, but the price uptrend did not last. At the moment, Shiba Inu is trading at $0.00002187 per CoinMarketCap. The Crypto Twitter community is not new to hints and riddles left by the official accounts of popular cryptocurrencies or crypto influencers. This time,  Grayscale  founder Barry Silbert decided to make his followers scratch their heads over his recent tweet. The top exec compared Bitcoin to Pink Floyd, Ethereum (ETH) was likened to U2, Litecoin to the Eagles, XRP to Coldplay and ZCash to Radiohead. However, Dogecoin was not given a comparison, with only a question mark left next to it. Santiment data demonstrates that  Cardano  (ADA) remains among the top five assets in terms of development activity. First place, according to Santiment’s tweet, is held by Uniswap (UNI) and second place by Solana (SOL). Cardano is sitting in third place, followed by Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM).

At a present market valuation of $27.92 billion, Cardano has surpassed Solana's $27.14 billion to clinch the 8th largest coin amid inflows into its ecosystem. The Cardano network has seen  inflows of funds  into its ecosystem as the total value locked (TVL) swelled from roughly $1.7 million seen in mid-January to a present $314.87 million, a near 18,420% increase. Cardano has entered the third phase of building its network, the Basho phase. In this stage, the network is supposed to deliver improved performance and scalability. As part of this phase, Cardano plans to release Hydra, a collection of Layer 2 solutions aimed at improving network security and scalability. In a scaling milestone, the first Hydra Heads have opened on the public Cardano testnet. Hydra Head, the first in a suite of protocols, is a critical element of Cardano's scaling journey. Since the start of March, the Cardano DeFi ecosystem has attracted nearly $150 million more in funds. This is reflected in the surge of total value locked (with the inclusion of staking) from roughly $168.95 million to $314.87 million. The spike in TVL was observed from Feb. 28 to March 16. Without the inclusion of staked governance assets, Cardano's TVL stood at $225.9 million presently. Cardano's Minswap has gained 121% in  total value locked (TVL)  over the last seven days, flipping SundaeSwap to become the largest protocol. The majority of funds on the network is now concentrated on the Minswap decentralized platform, with $115.19 million currently locked.

Don’t miss anything important in the crypto industry! In its recently-released “A Practical Guide for Arab Central Banks,” the Arab Monetary Fund has listed  RippleNet  as a direct alternative to SWIFT. The document advises Arab central banks to improve their ""messaging protocols"" using systems such as SWIFT GPI and RippleNet. This comes just two days after  the news  of Ripple partner The Clearing House, collaborating with Wells Fargo to produce an alternative payment system to SWIFT. What is the connection between  Elon Musk’s tweet  about turning the other cheek to an aggressor and Dogecoin? Most people would be caught off guard with this question, except for one Twitter user. On Saturday, the head of Tesla shared his thoughts on this biblical concept with his followers, which inspired Twitter user @greg16676935420 to find a hidden DOGE-related message in the centibillionaire's post. Greg jokingly assumed that Musk hid the following among the words of this tweet: “DOGE is powerful.” The post quickly went viral, hitting over 3,000 likes. According to WhaleStats data,  Shiba Inu  is back on the list of the top 10 crypto assets actively purchased by the largest 100 Ethereum investors.

The change, which will boost the network’s capacity, is expected to come into effect later today. 
 
Developers will be able to make use of this extra memory by running more sophisticated scripts. 
 
Cardano has been routinely implementing several incremental improvements that are meant to make the proof-of-stake blockchain more scalable. Last month, its block size was boosted by 11%.
The Input Output is expecting to see “high volumes” of network traffic as more decentralized applications are launching on top of the network.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Surpasses Bitcoin and Ethereum in Adjusted Transaction Volume: Details,"According to Messari.io tracking service, Cardano successfully surpassed  Bitcoin  and Ethereum in terms of adjusted transaction volume on the chain. As the metric suggests, ADA gained $68 billion while Bitcoin and Ethereum only have $8 billion in volume in total. Thanks to the Adjusted Transaction volume metric, users can see more informational transaction-related data rather than comparing chains based on regular transactional volume. The metric gives users more insight as it only covers account-based transactions. In terms of regular transaction volume, which is often distorted by UTXO transactions, Bitcoin and  Ethereum  have almost two times more volume together. But despite Cardano's leadership in terms of volume on Messari,  CoinMarketCap's  data suggests that the cryptocurrency is far from being superior in terms of volume, with only $931 million. We could tie the most likely reason behind the explosive growth of volume on the Cardano network to the increased popularity of the project's DeFi solutions as the total value of funds locked in the contract faced another 13% spike after the opening of Minswap. The TVL for  Cardano  remained in a sharp uptrend since March 10. Since then, ADA has gained approximately 10% to its value and broke the short-term descending channel. While losing the DeFi rally in terms of TVL to bigger chains like Ethereum and Solana, ADA could still release the smart contracts technology and support the development of major solutions on their chain like SundaeSwap. According to the most recent roadmap of the project, Cardano might soon have the burning mechanism implemented on the network, which should have the same effect on the coin as it had on the Ethereum network.",https://u.today/cardano-surpasses-bitcoin-and-ethereum-in-adjusted-transaction-volume-details,utoday,2022-03-21,11:29:00,en

The Cardano network has seen a significant increase in inflows into its ecosystem, resulting in a spike in total value locked (TVL). According to DefiLlama, Cardano's TVL presently stands at $272.38 million. With the inclusion of staked governance tokens in the TVL valuation, Cardano's TVL is much greater and stands at $361.4 million presently. The majority of funds on the network is now concentrated on the MinSwap decentralized platform, with $174.51 million currently locked. Second place is held by the SundaeSwap decentralized finance platform with $108.14 million locked. Meld has $72.44 million in total value locked. The Cardano (ADA) network saw a significant upgrade in September 2021, which allowed the implementation of smart contracts capabilities, allowing the blockchain to develop and operate at a faster rate than it had previously been able to.

According to the provided chart, ADA reached $0.97, which is the price level that remains above the mentioned resistance. The last time Cardano successfully broke the resistance was back in the middle of January, but it unfortunately recovered back below the resistance line shortly after. ADA remained under the abovementioned resistance for more than 180 days, which indicates that there is not enough buying power to shift the trend for Cardano. After reaching the all-time high back in August, one of Ethereum's competitors failed to enter another uptrend or consolidation. The reason behind the vigorous growth of the underlying asset of Cardano is most likely tied to the growth of both the number of projects on the network and the spike in the total value of funds locked in various smart contracts on the network. As U.Today previously  reported , both adjusted transaction volume and TVL on  Cardano  broke records with the volume on the network beating both Bitcoin and Ethereum and the value of funds locked in DeFi projects powered by Cardano reaching $270 million. The spike in TVL was caused mostly by the release of new projects on the network like Minswap, which became the main competitor of SundaeSwap. Together, the projects hold around 99% of the TVL. Back in the summer, Cardano presented the smart contracts powered by the network, which is why ADA rallied to $3.2 in a matter of months.

The new fund will be the 18th investment product of the company. Smart contracts are the backbone of the modern crypto economy as they act as automatic programs run on blockchains. Developers build all their decentralized solutions on the technology since it allows the automatic execution of certain conditions in a decentralized manner. With the help of smart contracts, such solutions as DeFi apps, NFTs, IDOs and others were created in 2021 only. The total worth of the industry may exceed trillions of U.S. dollars. In 2021, the demand for the DeFi and NFT industry increased exponentially with the capitalization of such projects as Ethereum, Solana and Cardano skyrocketing by over 100%. Such vigorous growth reflected the existing trends on the market. The new fund will make it possible for institutional investors to follow the trend by being exposed to such projects as  Solana , Avalanche, Polygon and others.

Minswap, a community-driven multi-pool decentralized exchange, accounts for 63.07% of the aforementioned sum. According to a recent Twitter announcement, the DEX is currently under maintenance after detecting several issues. Users are unable to swap, withdraw or harvest their yield farming rewards. However, it is still possible to cancel one’s order. 
 
The Minswap exchange had its mainnet debut Minswap on March 9. After that, its TVL started experiencing rapid growth. Over the past seven days, it has grown a whopping 116%, steadily approaching the $200 million. On March 16, the exchange also launched support for yield farming. SundaeSwap , which was initially billed as the flagship Cardano-based DEX, has now ceded ground to Minswap. The project has failed to gain any traction over the past week, with its TVL being stuck at $111 million.

Its inventor, Charles Hoskinson, shares his excitement. According to the statement by Mr. Morgan Schofield, head of ecosystem growth at Input Output Global, Cardano's (ADA) smart contracts platform now hosts four million non-fungible tokens (NFTs). Today we will witness the 4,000,000th  #Cardano   #NFT  being minted, with 50,000 distinct minting policies. ? 
 
As we scale throughput, this pace will increase. 
Digital, sovereign ownership has never been so easy or secure.  #CNFT   #CardanoCommunity   #NFTCommunity   pic.twitter.com/4GaK5XcrgN About 50,000 different minting policies are registered on Cardano (ADA) blockchain: most likely, these metrics are correlated with the total number of Cardano-centric NFT issuers. Moreover, the number of ""individual"" NFTs is far higher, Mr. Schofield adds, as some items actually boast thousands of pictures attached. Cardano's founder Charles Hoskinson is impressed by the number and even  admitted  being wrong about the real progress of Cardano (ADA) adoption: Remember when I predicted thousands of assets and DApps on Cardano? Well I was wrong, there are now millions of native assets issued and DApps are now in the hundreds. #SlowAndSteady. Mr. Schofield foresees that the pace of adoption will only increase due to the high scalability of Cardano (ADA) as a platform for tokens of all types.

 However, he may have misremembered his own tweet, as he had  predicted  back in July 2020 that by 2021, there would be “hundreds of assets and thousands of DApps” on Cardano.  While the number of assets appears to have  exceeded  his predictions by 2022 thanks to new nonfungible token ( NFT ) minting protocols, the number of decentralized apps running on the network isn‘t so impressive.

The Jan. 21  launch of the SundaeSwap decentralized exchange  (DEX) helped spark a big increase in total value locked. Leading up to the launch, Cardano TVL shot up more than 24 times from $3 million to $87.7 in a single day from Jan. 20-21, according to DefiLlama.

With the massive growth of the TVL, trading volume and other fundamental metrics on Cardano, the price of the underlying asset of the network, ADA, broke through numerous resistance lines and entered a wide range between the 50 and 200 day moving averages. The most important move made by ADA was the swift breakout of the 50-day moving average, which was not successfully tested in February, when ADA's price spiked to $1.20. But despite the strong price action, it lost all momentum and dropped to $0.70. The complete shift of the global trend will most likely happen only after  ADA  manages to break through the next resistance line of the 200-day moving average.

Cardano: Not so bullish yet? ADA's price jumped by around 7.5% in trading on March 25, reaching $1.19 over a month after bottoming out at around $0.75. The Cardano token's huge rebound move netted around 60% in gains. Nonetheless, it remained at the risk of losing its upside momentum in the coming weeks. At the core of this bearish analogy is a multi-month descending channel pattern, with a reliable track record of causing and limiting  ADA's rebound attempts  simultaneously since September 2021.  The channel's upper trendline particularly has served as an ideal selloff zone, now being tested again as resistance, as shown in the chart below. ADA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView ADA's daily relative strength index, now at 71.80, also alerts about its ""overbought"" nature.  In a perfect scenario , an RSI reading above 70 leads to selloffs in an attempt to neutralize the underlying asset's excessive valuation. That puts the Cardano token at an imminent pullback risk toward the descending channel's lower trendline. More signs of ADA's potential pullback move come from its weekly charts. Notably, the Cardano token's rebound has been having it test its 20-week (near $1.21) and 50-week (near $1.31) exponential moving averages (EMA) as resistances. They were instrumental in capping ADA's gains in January 2022.  ADA/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView Alex Benfield, an analyst at Weiss Ratings,  said  ADA needs to reclaim $1.20 as support, a level that kept its bullish bias intact multiple times in 2021.

The meme coin has outperformed every major altcoin over the aforementioned period of time. As  reported by U.Today , the Bitcoin parody saw a double-digit price increase on Thursday after Bitcoin of America, a popular cryptocurrency ATM operator, added Dogecoin to the list of available coins. At the same time, trading app Voyager also added support for Dogecoin.       
 
Earlier today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk commented on the idea of buying Twitter and changing the bird logo to that of Doge, claiming that it would be “sick.” Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, remains in the doldrums, currently changing hands at the $44,500 level on major spot exchanges. Bulls have so far failed to gain footing above the $45,000 level that was recently described as a “key pivot” by veteran trader John Bollinger.     
 
Ethereum is also struggling to make another move higher as the second-largest cryptocurrency remains below the $3,200 level. 
 
Dogecoin rival Shiba Inu is also flat-lining at the time of writing, adding a mere 0.67%.
 Zilliqa (ZIL) is up 73.17% over the last 24 hours, becoming the best-performing altcoin within the CoinMarketCap top 100. It is followed by VeChain (VET), which has gained 14.50% over the same period of time. Holo (HOT) also registered a double-digit price increase, spiking by more than 10 percent.

The world's first cryptocurrency was trading at just $92 back then. The price rally was linked to the Cyprus banking crisis. 
 
Notably, the event was covered by none other than Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin. Before helping to launch the world's second-largest cryptocurrency, he would write articles for Bitcoin Magazine, one of the first cryptocurrency-related publications. 
 
Mt. Gox, which went out of business due to a crippling hacking incident that took place in February 2014, was still the dominant cryptocurrency trading platform back in the day. 
 
Back then, Bitcoin was yet to become a mainstream asset despite growing adoption. During its first years, the cryptocurrency's reputation was tainted by drug dealing and other nefarious activities.  The market capitalization of Bitcoin is currently sitting at $902 billion, according to CoinMarketCap data. The price of the top cryptocurrency has rallied roughly 15.58% over the past week, currently trading at $47,649 on major spot exchanges. 
 
If Bitcoin were a company, it would be the seventh-biggest company in the world (behind only Tesla, Amazon, Alphabet, Saudi Aramco, Microsoft and Apple). 
 
Despite hitting impressive milestones, Bitcoin still has a lot of catching up to do in order to match the market cap of gold, which currently stands at roughly $12.2 trillion.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Ecosystem Grows as Peer-to-Peer Lending to Be Introduced in May,"According to the announcement from the AadaFinance project, peer-to-peer lending powered by the  Cardano  ecosystem is getting ready for the launch of the first version of the  protocol  in May 2022. As the loan scheme suggests, the process of borrowing, with the help of Aada's protocol, is quite similar to solutions based on Ethereum. First of all, the borrower creates a request and deposits collateral into a smart contract. The lender funds the loan via the smart contract, and both parties receive a non-fungible token that will be used later when the borrower returns his or her collateral. ❓ Peer to peer lending? 
 
‼️ Yes, you heard it right. We will launch the first version (V1) of our protocol in early May ? 
 
?More information will seek this week!  pic.twitter.com/AlkTrOwcW2 Whenever the requestor no longer needs the funds, he returns the take amount to the borrower and receives his or her collateral back from the smart contract with deducted fees and the non-fungible token, while the lender gets the assets back with accumulated fees and also returns the non-fungible token. According to CoinMarketCap, the  capitalization  of the biggest and considerably best lending and borrowing platforms, like Aave, increased largely in 2021 and reached approximately $3 billion. Following the recovery of the market, the resumed growth of the DeFi industry and other positive factors,  Cardano's  price on the market rallied by more than 35% in the last 10 days, correlating with the network's TVL that reached $326 million in March. As the chart on DeFiLIama suggests, a massive increase in TVL began in March as the network entered the third month of the year with only $74 million and then faced a 350% increase. Such a massive inflow of funds is most likely tied to the release of additional products on the network, like Minswap.",https://u.today/cardano-ecosystem-grows-as-peer-to-peer-lending-to-be-introduced-in-may,utoday,2022-03-28,11:25:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Beats Solana, Aave and Terra as Market Capitalization Reaches $40 Billion","Cardano (ADA) enters seventh place as one of the biggest  blockchains  in the world with more than $40 billion in total market capitalization. The increase was followed by both market and fundamental growth of a project that recently celebrated $300 million in TVL. The main reason behind such a swift increase in capitalization is tied to the growth of the network from both a market and fundamental perspective. The capitalization of the project correlates with the price of the underlying ADA token—the price of which has recently reached $1.2. The price increase could not have been possible without a growing number of various decentralized solutions powered by Cardano. Previously, U.Today described two solutions that users would be able to see in this year: decentralized  peer-to-peer lending  and borrowing and an interoperable Layer 2. The main reason behind such an increase is tied to at least two factors: release of new DeFi platforms like Minswap and the general recovery of the DeFi industry that lost some of its popularity back in December-January. According to DeFiLIama, the total value of funds locked across all projects in the industry increased from around $200 billion to $223 billion at the end of March. As for Cardano, the total value of funds locked on blockchain-powered platforms and apps increased from $134 million to $326 million in the last 28 days. Inflows into the DeFi industry indicate that the market's demand for risk-on assets increased once again, and investors are more actively redistributing their portfolios, exposing themselves to  riskier  options like high-APY stablecoins.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-beats-solana-aave-and-terra-as-market-capitalization-reaches-40-billion,utoday,2022-03-28,13:56:00,en
cardano, Sponsored , Decentralized media may represent a new future: one that puts creators on top ,"One of the most significant issues content creators and artists face today is a lack of control regarding their overall content. Platforms like YouTube and Twitch constantly alter the rules when it comes to content uploads, forcing users to cater to these new algorithms if they wish to succeed. Instead of media conglomerates owning and controlling content, creators posit a different idea — that media organizations should be owned by creators and consumers rather than third-party intermediaries. Such a view is standard in the Web3 space, and fortunately,  decentralized technology  such as blockchain and cryptocurrencies enable this future. And one project, the Cardano ( ADA )-powered Flickto, is aiming to facilitate it. Decentralized media Flickto  is building what it calls DeMe, or decentralized media. To Flickto, DeMe is defined as an open-source platform that allows users to pitch and fund their media projects.  While creators pitch their projects on the Flickto incubator, the community is voting on the ones they believe have the most value. Supporting projects is possible through staking the FLICK token and voting on pitches that the user deems worthy. Projects with the most votes will receive funding from the Flickto platform, alongside assistance in various avenues like marketing, sales, pre- and post-production and much more.  From there, voters can communicate with creators, ensuring the two parties can work together to create something truly remarkable. Voters can then earn FLICK when projects perform well,  generating a passive income for themselves . Democratizing creation Flickto hopes to achieve what the current creative industry cannot: the democratization of content ownership. However, they’re looking for community funding to do so.  The company is currently holding an initial staking pool on Cardano and has also been working hard to expand other offerings. It has recently expanded its team, established new partnerships, held two successful IDO raises and more –– all to build the foundation of its vision. More insights from Flickto  here “The optimism and hope generated by DeMe is not to be understated. The ability for anyone to learn and apply their creative expertise to produce meaningful content has been emphasized through the rise of platforms like Youtube where creators ultimately give away ownership and creative control to meet the needs of obscure algorithms or centralized authority,” the team shares. “Flickto brings change to this status quo. Placing creators and consumers in the driving seat of media projects to ensure they create thriving communities and projects not reliant on a centralized authority.” Learn more about  Flickto Disclaimer.

Read the top four news stories over the past weekend to find out! Patrick Hansen , head of growth and strategy at decentralized finance start-up Unstoppable Finance, started a worrying Twitter thread, stating that the European Parliament is about to vote to include unhosted wallets in the anti-money laundering package as part of the Transfer of Funds Regulation. While the FATF travel rule requires businesses to verify transactions that exceed 1,000 euros, the draft does not include any lower limit, meaning that all crypto transactions will be accompanied by sharing of personal information. The Economic Affairs Committee is set to vote on the de-anonymizing all cryptocurrency transactions to self-hosted wallets tomorrow, on March 29. In their recent letter to Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn,  Ripple  executives’ lawyers have condemned the SEC’s conduct and called for immediate ""sanctions"" against the regulator. The lawyers state that the SEC has not ""met its burden to prove"" that Dr. Metz's last minute ""expert report"" is pertinent to the trial and will not prejudice the outcome. Also, according to the letter, Dr. Metz's unauthorized reply added new opinions entirely that were not present in his original report. The SEC's questionable conduct and general lack of transparency ""necessitates sanctions,"" Garlinghouse's lawyers said. The Queen of Pop,  Madonna , has joined Justin Bieber and Eminem in buying a Bored Ape NFT, according to her announcement on Instagram. The superstar’s NFT piece features a bored-looking ape wearing a black leather cap, matching the style of its new owner. Madonna’s fans, however, were not impressed by her foray into NFTs, with some of them even saying that the pop star is destroying her musical legacy by promoting questionable crypto projects. Madonna is not new to the crypto industry. In 2018, she  partnered with blockchain company Ripple  to raise funds for orphans in Miami. Cardano  might be set to hit a major interoperability milestone amid the debut of Milkomeda, an EVM-compatible Layer 2. The launch of the Milkomeda C1 mainnet is expected on March 28. Previously, Milkomeda launched a bridge testnet between Cardano and Ethereum. Now, the bridge is expected to go live in mainnet. Once deployed, assets can be sent back and forth between the two blockchains via the bridge. Users holding tokens on the connected chain can move these assets to Cardano and vice versa.

With the release of new solutions on the chain, Cardano becomes more relevant for institutional investments that often look for real value behind the project rather than speculative returns. In analogy with Ethereum’s path on the  market , experts expect a rapid increase in Cardano's capitalization and number of users. The theory speaks of the increase in transactional volume, number of holders and total value locked in various smart contracts. Previously, Cardano's TVL exceeded $300 million while staying at around $100 million at the beginning of the month.

The year began with about 3.4 million addresses, which has now grown to 5 million. While only seven decentralized applications (DApps) appear on DefiLlama currently, co-founder Charles Hoskinson said  many more are expected  to follow due to a hard fork expected mid-year.

The two ETPs have started trading on Euronext exchanges located in Amsterdam and Paris. 
 
The products boast a total expense ratio (TER) of just 0.95%. It measures the total costs associated with operating a certain investment fund. 
 
According to Eric Balchunas, Bloomberg's senior ETF analyst, the offering is poised to severely undercut Switzerland-based crypto ETP issuer 21Shares, which charges its investors a 2.5% management fee. 
 
Earlier this week, the Solana, Cardano and Polkadot ETPs were also launched on Zurich-based SIX Swiss Exchange and Frankfurt-based Xetra. 
 
Cryptocurrency ETPs provide investors with exposure to a slew of cryptocurrencies in a secure and cost-efficient manner. Such products are typically popular in Europe, where regulators have shown a willingness to list such products. As  reported by U.Today , 21Shares recently launched ETPs for such exotic cryptocurrencies as Decentraland (MANA) and Aave (AAVE). 
 
Crypto investment firms are getting more creative. Earlier this month, Bloomberg  reported  that CoinShares had joined forces with crypto exchange FTX in order to launch a Solana-based ETP that would offer staking rewards in order to reduce management costs for investors.  While there is already stiff competition among ETP issuers that offer exposure to esoteric altcoins, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is yet to greenlight a physically backed Bitcoin exchange-traded fund. 
 
Leading cryptocurrency asset management  Grayscale Investments , which is vying to be the first to launch a spot-based Bitcoin ETF, recently warned that its quest to launch such a product could result in a lawsuit against the formidable regulator.",https://u.today/wisdomtree-launches-solana-cardano-and-polkadot-etps-on-euronext-exchanges,utoday,2022-03-31,14:24:00,en

As  reported by U.Today , the price of Bitcoin recently reached a year-to-date peak of $48,234 on the Bitstamp exchange. 
 
Yet, publicly listed cryptocurrency firms are struggling to benefit from the recent rally. Cryptocurrency mining stocks have taken the harshest beating, with their shares losing more than half of their value since November. The stock of Bitcoin mining company Stronghold Digital recently plunged by more than 30% after a painful revenue miss that caught some shareholders off guard. The firm's outlook for the rest of 2022 remains grim now that it has admitted that its ambitious hashrate target will not be achievable due to operational issues. 
 
Shares of Bit Digital, Hut 8 Mining Corp and other prominent mining companies are down more than 20% since the start of the year despite the fact that the price of Bitcoin briefly turned green over the same period of time. 
 
Shares of Bitcoin-focused business intelligence firm MicroStrategy are also down more than 10% on a year-to-date basis. The stock is also down roughly 41% from its November peak of 860%. That said, the company keeps doubling down on its unyielding support for the largest cryptocurrency. As  reported by U.Today , it recently secured a $205 million loan to buy even more Bitcoin. MicroStrategy currently holds about $5.9 billion in the largest cryptocurrency. According to analyst Christopher Brendler, the shares of these companies are affected by the inhospitable environment in the equities market.

cardano, News , Is Ethereum really the best blockchain to form a DAO? ,"The crypto community and industry have chosen Ethereum as the chain of choice for most blockchain-based decentralized applications (DApps), but other chains may be better suited to handle the workload for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). Technical advantages and cheaper transactions have yet to become a major pull factor from Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) chains. EVM compatibility enables a network to  use Ethereum’s security features .  Ethereum and its compatible chains have a clear advantage in the number of DAOs compared to any other. They house more than 4,200 DAOs and protocols requiring governance participants according to data from blockchain voting platform Snapshot.  Comparatively, the Solana ecosystem has only 140, Cardano has 10 DAOs,  according  to ecosystem tracker Cardano Cube and Polkadot Substrate  says  it has just eight. This is not to discount the fact that among the top 10 DAOs by the number of decisions made over the past seven days, DAO tracker DeepDAO shows that three are  based  on Solana. Ethereum’s leg up over the rest may be due to simple yet practical reasons, according to DAO tracker DeepDAO CEO Eyal Eithcowich in response to Cointelegraph. He attributes Ethereum’s dominance to the fact that it is “the chain where the DAO movement started.” “More importantly, Ethereum is the most mature ecosystem in terms of tools for starting and managing all facets of DAOs, mostly financial but not only. This may change as other chains grow in popularity.” On the other hand, he pointed to high gas fees as a shortcoming of Ethereum. He added that Solana allows DAOs to make fast and cheap transactions, “But, again, the supporting features and tools in the ecosystem are less robust.” Additionally, Solana has become vulnerable to  infrequent network outages . The  co-founder of the nonfungible token  (NFT) game on the EOSIO-based WAX network Alien Worlds, Saro McKenna, told Cointelegraph last week that she believes EOSIO is better for building DAOs.  In her view, Ethereum is too expensive for voting purposes and was designed to be a “general-purpose blockchain” to handle any number of different tasks. This contrasts with EOSIO, which McKenna said “was partly built for the purpose of DAOs.” “The EOSIO codebase is extremely powerful, allowing for layered multisig permissions and dynamic collection election mechanisms that are critical for DAOs to function properly.” Gas fees have long been an issue for Ethereum users, but in March, fees were at their  lowest levels since last August . Related:  Opera integrates Bitcoin, Solana, Polygon and five other blockchains However, CEO of blockchain consulting firm Koinos Andrew Levine had  pointed criticisms of EOSIO  which could explain why it falls short of Ethereum’s rate of adoption. In February, he wrote that while EOS transactions are virtually fee-less, there is an account creation fee. Furthermore, holding coins on an account is fairly complicated compared to Ethereum: “The EOS database is built on something called ‘memory-mapped files,’ another vestige of the Steem design, an important consequence of which is that it is designed to use the most expensive form of storage possible: random-access memory.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/is-ethereum-really-the-best-blockchain-to-form-a-dao,cointelegraph,2022-04-04,00:00:00,en

The competition consisted of four rounds with a total of 16 coins, including Binance Coin, Cardano, Solana, Polkadot and Dogecoin. During the first three rounds, Shiba Inu managed to top Terra, Solana and Cardano, and then secured a victory after facing off against Polygon in the grand finale. According to an article by Santiment, the crypto market is about to face  Bitcoin’s  next mid-halving correction. While halving usually leads to a significant spike in the BTC price, mid-halving might not be so upbeat for the market. As shown on the chart shared by Santiment, each mid-halving event was marked with a local price top, after which Bitcoin's value decreased until the next halving. Experts, however, note that it remains unclear whether or not Bitcoin will follow the same pattern as it did before, since it is still in the local uptrend that started in the middle of March. Ripple partner  iRemit, which leverages Ripple's ODL to process Australia-to-Philippines remittances, has entered into a partnership with Velo labs to unlock the $34 billion cross-border payment market in the Philippines.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Marks New ATH with Number of Holders Reaching 5.1 Million,"The Cardano network reached a new milestone of over five million addresses functioning on the network with a year-to-date increase of 48%. The strong increase in the number of users correlates with the rising number of dApps and solutions on the network, showing the fundamental growth of the  network . Back in March 2021, the number of addresses on the  Cardano  network totaled around 2.6  million. By comparing both TVL and the number of holders metric, we can clearly see the spike in the number of addresses with the release of smart contracts technology for Cardano. Thanks to high demand for decentralized finance, Cardano could get a ""second wind"" in terms of development and fundamental growth. We can clearly see the dynamic before the announcement of the new disruptive technology as the price of underlying coin ADA barely moved since the bullrun of 2017. $ADA  holders are on the rise.

But the announcement's effect on the price was mostly speculative, which made ADA a heavily overbought asset. As the imbalance between sell and buy orders appeared, the market could not cover the selling pressure, which sent the asset tumbling down to new lows. Since the announcement of smart contracts, ADA dropped by over 70%.

A focus on delivering cutting-edge programs in Africa seems beneficial to Cardano as it might accelerate the growth of its ecosystem. In late February, John O'Connor, IOHK director of African operations, shared the news about the first set of loans being disbursed to Kenya SMEs, highlighting the incoming potential of Cardano's RealFi. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson revealed that the company plans to  introduce  peer-to-peer (P2P) lending across Africa this year, starting with Kenya. This, he believes, is part of an effort to close the gap between industrialized and developing countries. Last year, Input-Output Global (IOG) announced its partnership with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide five million Ethiopian students with a way to verify their academic credentials using Atala PRISM technology, built on Cardano. IOG is also working with World Mobile in Zanzibar to connect the unconnected and enable access to essential online services through blockchain technology. In a  blog post , Cardano's parent firm, IOHK, described these partnerships as a ""launchpad"" for Cardano's goal to build RealFi.

In a nutshell, NFT bonds are two different types of assets: borrower's note and lender's bond. The first one holds an NFT and pays back the loan with a guarantee to take back the collateral before maturity. The lender's bond works with the other with a guarantee to claim a loan, interest if the loan was liquidated and interest with collateral. Regular bonds will act in a similar way to  traditional financial  alternatives, where they bring interest over time depending on the bond's type and percentage. Bonds bought on the decentralized platform are expected to bring a certain amount of tokens in the next few months when they expire.

cardano, News , 67% of Cardano holders underwater and most bought less than 1 year ago ,"As Cardano ( ADA ) prices fall back toward the psychological one dollar level, more and more investors are finding themselves with unrealized losses by holding on to the digital asset. Cardano’s ADA token has had a bearish week. Since Monday, the price has fallen 11.4%, resulting in more holders being in the red. More significantly, ADA is now 64.7% below its September 2  all-time high of $3.09  and is in danger of falling below a dollar over the next few days should the trend continue. According  to IntoTheBlock’s in/out of the money indicator, more than two-thirds, or 67% of ADA holders, are underwater. A quarter of Cardano investors are green, and 9% of them are at a breakeven point. The indicator identifies the average cost at which the tokens were purchased and compares it to the current price, which was $1.09 at the time of writing. The analytics provider reported that 3.41 million ADA addresses are red compared to just 1.25 million in green. In/Out of the Money: IntoTheBlock A related metric is the amount of time the token has been held. The vast majority, or 76% of ADA holders, have held it for between one and 12 months. Just 11% of Cardano investors have held the token for more than a year, and those are the ones that are still in profit. From a technical standpoint, ADA has turned bearish and could quite quickly revisit its 2022 and yearly low point of around $0.80, which occurred in mid-March. This would plunge even more investors into the red unless they sell at a loss. The slide in prices could be tied to the network not living up to high expectations set around the launch of smart contracts. In terms of the numbers of decentralized applications (DApps), Cardano  is still somewhat of a wasteland , with DefiLlama  reporting  that there are just ten decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols running on the network with a combined total value locked of around $233 million.  Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson, however, believes that many Cardano DApps are waiting for the Vasil hard fork in June, to launch. The“Basho” phase of the Cardano upgrade roadmap will  focus  on scalability and smart contracts with a new technology called Hydra to boost network throughput even further.  Related:   Cardano Foundation and the University of Zurich expand academic blockchain research In terms of other fundamentals, Cardano is looking relatively strong.

That feeling when you deploy your enormous premine to boost your TVL  https://t.co/ksoyE9k7DD   pic.twitter.com/ownQFQWJmz According to  DefiLlama , Cardano's total value locked is currently $298.27 million. Without the inclusion of staked governance tokens in the TVL valuation, Cardano's TVL stands at about $219.42 million. Total value locked (TVL) refers to the total worth of crypto assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol—or in DeFi protocols. Cardano has witnessed steady growth in TVL from January, after the launch of projects Sundaeswap and Minswap, which contributed immensely to its TVL. Taken from all-time highs of $434.74 million in TVL reached on March 28, Cardano has seen nearly 50,000% growth in TVL since the start of 2022. Despite the growth, Cardano is far from catching up with other major ""Ethereum killers"" such as Terra, Avalanche and Solana. According to  DefiLlama 's rankings of decentralized finance platforms, Cardano is currently in a distant 28th place. As previously covered by  U.Today , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson explains the seeming delay in growth because many decentralized applications (dApps) are waiting for the Vasil hard fork to benefit from pipelining. Pipelining is a scaling solution that accelerates the process of distributing blocks, thus drastically reducing the ""dead time"" between them. This would make it possible to implement more aggressive changes such as reference scripts, which could dramatically increase the blockchain's throughout. Presently, there are currently 10 dApps contributing to the total value locked on Cardano. MuesliSwap became the first decentralized exchange to launch on the mainnet in late December. Sundaeswap launched in January, while MinSwap made its debut in March.

Ethereum, which is currently the leading force in the decentralized finance (DeFi) space, uses the account-based model, which represents assets as balances. Hence, users are able to partially use their accounts instead of spending the whole thing.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's Annual Interest Rate Spikes to 54% as Binance Running Short on Supply,"One of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world,  Binance , is reportedly short on its supply of  Cardano  as investors are moving the coin away from exchanges and using it in alternative decentralized solutions and wallets. Binance's staking feature is created to control the supply of various cryptocurrencies on the platform, as the outflow trend is still on the market since 2021. Whenever the exchange's supply is running short, it uses various techniques for attracting more funds to their  wallets . With Binance, the platform offers a relatively high interest rate for anyone who deposits their ADA coins. Compared to stablecoin staking, which offers around 10% APY, the rate of 54% is considered significantly higher compared to the average market offering. As more traders and investors deposit their Cardano on the platform, the interest rate will slowly get down to an average value, which causes the stabilization of the supply of  ADA  on the exchange. Usually, exchanges are using the supply to fund short-orders and pay income from open positions. March was a considerably successful month for ADA, which gained over 50% to its value since the local bottom reached on March 14. After reaching $1.2, Cardano swiftly reversed below the $1 threshold and now trades at $0.9. Following the retrace, Cardano dropped below the 50-day moving average, showing lack of buying power on the market and the bearish sentiment of long-term investors. Cardano remained in the prolonged downtrend for the last 230 days.

This is reflected in the surge of the total value locked (TVL) from roughly $267 million on April 12 to $313 million seen at the time of publication. Without the inclusion of staked governance tokens in TVL valuation, Cardano's TVL stands at about $235.47 million. Total value locked (TVL) refers to the total worth of crypto assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol—or in DeFi protocols. Cardano witnessed steady growth in TVL from January, after the launch of projects Sundaeswap and Minswap, which contributed immensely to its TVL. Taken from all-time highs of $434.74 million in TVL reached on March 28, Cardano has seen nearly 50,000% growth in TVL since the start of 2022. Presently, there are currently 10 dApps contributing to the total value locked on Cardano. MuesliSwap became the first decentralized exchange to launch on mainnet in late December.

The Ripple-SEC lawsuit , which started back in December 2020, is still on its way to a resolution, with the San Francisco-based tech giant being the one with more victories on its side. With that said, Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn brought Ripple another “very big win,” as James K. Filan called it in his recent tweet, by denying the SEC’s motion for reconsideration of the DPP ruling. Previously, the court ordered the regulator to turn over some documents, including a draft of William Hinman’s infamous Ethereum speech, which, according to the SEC, was protected by the DPP. The judge, however, opined that the personal views of the agency’s staff were not shielded by the privilege, defining the emails as “neither pre-decisional nor deliberative.” The efforts of the  Shiba Inu  community to persuade Robinhood to list its beloved canine coin have finally borne fruit. According to a listing bot, the commission-free investing app added support for SHIB. Shiba Inu has been listed alongside Solana (SOL), Polygon (MATIC) and Compound (COMP), bringing the total number of available cryptocurrencies to 11. The news made the price of the SHIB token spike 8.3%. According to CoinMarketCap, it is currently trading at $0.00002652. Binance , one of the world’s biggest crypto exchanges, is craving additional supply of Cardano as investors are moving the coin away from exchanges and using it in alternative decentralized solutions and wallets. In case the exchange runs short, Binance uses various techniques to attract more funds to their wallets, such as offering a relatively high interest rate (54%) for anyone who deposits their ADA coins. As more traders and investors deposit their Cardano on the platform, the interest rate will slowly get down to an average value, stabilizing Binance’s supply of ADA.

Check out the top four news stories over the past day! According to  David Gokhshtein’s  recent tweet, Shiba Inu, the second largest meme coin, could ""touch"" the $0.001 mark. However, he does not reckon Shiba Inu can reach $1. Gokhshtein’s view on the coin’s price attracted lots of SHIB fans to the comments section; they rebuked the influencer, reminding him that the dev team of SHIB has not yet revealed an additional burn mechanism for the token. Despite this pinch of salt, the founder of Gokhshtein Media expressed a more positive opinion about Shiba Inu in his earlier tweet, saying that it can attract numerous amateur investors to the giants of the crypto market, Bitcoin and Ethereum. Prominent trader  Peter Brandt  shared a prediction in response to a tweet by long-time Bitcoin proponent Tuur Demeester. The latter claims that after long-lasting periods of consolidation, BTC tends to explode “like nothing on this planet.” According to Brandt, Bitcoin could either increase 10 times two years from now or continue its streak of sideways trading for a prolonged period of time.  Previously , a veteran trader forecasted that Bitcoin’s next “rocket stage” may be ignited in 2024 based on how previous market cycles have played out.

Harrison also shared IOHK's tweet on the Plutus enhancements that will boost Cardano throughput in June. If you want understand more about some of the  #Plutus  enhancements the Vasil hard fork will bring to  #Cardano , read this. 
 
Next, be sure to tune into tomorrow's mid month update to enjoy a rather nice deeper dive segment  @JohnAlanWoods  has recorded for the show specially ?  https://t.co/gsyYWTaiM1 Cardano's big update, the Vasil hard fork, is expected to land in June. The upgrade in question appears to be named after Vasil Dabov, the late Bulgarian mathematician who was a prominent member of the Cardano community. The June event remains of paramount importance to the Cardano ecosystem as it is expected to accentuate growth. In March,  Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson, while commenting on the growth of the ecosystem, explained that many decentralized applications (dApps) are waiting for the Vasil hard fork to benefit from pipelining. Pipelining is a scaling solution that accelerates the process of distributing blocks, thus drastically reducing the ""dead time"" between them. It would make it possible to implement more aggressive changes such as reference scripts, which could dramatically increase the blockchain's throughput. As stated in an IOHK blog post, Plutus script referencing and reference inputs are two major improvements planned to be included in the June Vasil hard fork. Along these lines, CIPs for reference inputs (CIP-31) and reference scripts (CIP-33) have been submitted for implementation on Cardano and are expected to be implemented as part of the Vasil hard fork in June. These Plutus enhancements, in addition to other scaling improvements, will increase throughput for decentralized apps (dApps), decentralized finance (DeFi), RealFi, products, smart contracts, and exchanges built or operating on Cardano. CIP-31 introduces a new mechanism for accessing information in datums, a reference input. Transaction outputs include datums, which allow for the storing and retrieval of data on the blockchain. CIP-33 offers script referencing, which is the ability to refer to a script without including it in each transaction, thus reducing the contribution of scripts to transaction size. Referencing scripts in several transactions can minimize transaction sizes, increase throughput and lower script execution costs.",https://u.today/cardanos-big-update-lands-in-june-iohk-shares-two-things-to-expect-details,utoday,2022-04-14,11:24:00,en

BlackRock, with over $9 trillion in assets under management, is broadly studying the crypto sector, including stablecoins, digital assets, permissioned blockchains and tokenization in general.

cardano,No Section,Here's How Cardano Can Catch up with Ethereum or Solana in 2022,"Cardano has already shown impressive performance in 2022, showing the fundamental growth of the network. But despite powerful performance in March, ADA is struggling to gain confidence in April, which is why some investors raise concerns on how Cardano is expected to close the  gap  with such projects as  Ethereum . Three main disadvantages  Cardano  has compared to the biggest networks like Ethereum and Solana are relatively lower speed of transaction processing, lack of decentralized applications and underachieved UX/UI. While dApps and UI/UX are issues that will be fixed as time goes by, the fundamental lag that Cardano always had compared to other projects is quite noticeable, especially after the NFT and dApps craze that took place in the summer of 2022. Cardano is rolling out a dAapps project only in 2022, while the trend is already showing signs of fading. Currently, Cardano is at 17 Dapps, with 10 L1s and 7 EVM L2 of Milkomeda C1. But at the same time,  Cardano  is expecting a rise in the number of lending products that will work in the ecosystem of decentralized exchanges that are being actively developed right now. As for processing speed, the developer community in the Cardano ecosystem is actively working on the project's scaling, which has already allowed ADA to appear in the top 10 of assets by TPS.

Descending channel hints at ADA sell-off ahead ADA, which makes up about 1.75% of the total crypto market capitalization, has been trending lower since September 2021 inside a “descending channel” pattern that has successfully capped its multiple upside attempts, as illustrated in the chart below. ADA/USD daily price chart featuring descending channel setup. Source: TradingView The channel showed further strength as ADA  broke above its upper trendline  on March 27 only to reverse entirely in later sessions, showing a lack of conviction among Cardano bulls.  ADA’s 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave), alongside the 0.236 Fib line (near $1.29) of the Fibonacci retracement graph, drawn from a $2.96 swing high to a $0.78 swing low, further aided the bearish bias. As of April 15, ADA’s price has been consolidating inside the $0.97–$0.92 range, signaling intentions to continue its pullback from its fakeout top near $1.25.  If the descending channel setup continues to pan out, ADA/USD could fall to its previous bottom range near $0.78 while eyeing the channel’s lower trendline around $0.65 as its primary downside target.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder Aims to Create Network Cross Chain for BTC, DOGE and ADA","Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  recently proposed creating a new decentralized social media platform from scratch together with Tesla Elon Musk in case the billionaire's audacious attempt to take over Twitter fails. In response to a user who asked if the decentralized media platform would be used across chains, the Cardano creator said it would be a cross-chain network with Bitcoin, Dogecoin and Cardano. Cross chain with Bitcoin, Doge, and Cardano  https://t.co/6Q8bJgaCY9 The Twitter user had asked, ''Great idea, but will it be able to be used across chains and not limited to Cardano-only? If it is only limited to Cardano or any single chain, then I don’t think it qualifies as true decentralization.'' As reported by  U.Today , Tesla CEO Elon Musk made an offer to pay $41 billion to make Twitter private, claiming that the unsolicited bid was meant to protect freedom of speech. Before that, he acquired a 9.2% stake in the company. In response to Musk's bid, the Twitter board seems to have adopted the ''poison pill,'' as covered by several  media outlets . The company is intent on fending off the billionaire's bid to buy it in a deal that could be worth more than $40 billion. Cardano's  big update , the Vasil hard fork, is expected to land in June. The upgrade in question appears to be named after Vasil Dabov, the late Bulgarian mathematician who was a prominent member of the Cardano community. Speaking on the expected update, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson said, ''This is one of the most important updates we've done in a long time.'' In a recent mid-month update,  IOHK  shared the latest on network performance and status on preparations for the major June Cardano release, including the target date for the Vasil hard fork, which is June 29.

After the offering, Hoskinson faced a wall of criticism, including questions about the network's choice for a potential decentralized alternative to the platform. Since Hoskinson works with Cardano blockchain, users suggested it would not be fair if the ""free version"" of Twitter would work on one blockchain only. Cross chain with Bitcoin, Doge, and Cardano  https://t.co/6Q8bJgaCY9 But Hoskinson rushed to calm down the community with the concept on which the decentralized version of the social network would work. According to another Tweet, Hoskinson would be happy to build a cross-chain between Dogecoin, Bitcoin and  Cardano  for the platform. Ironically, Hoskinson did not mention the  Ethereum  network in his blockchain trifecta since it is considered the major competitor of Cardano in the same category as Solana. Since Cardano has barely implemented smart contracts technology and has released some solutions on the network, it is almost impossible that someone would successfully build such a complicated structure like a social media platform based purely on Cardano. It is also not clear how  cryptocurrencies  fit platforms like Twitter apart from tipping and transferring funds, which is not a primary goal of such platforms. Even if the richest person on Earth builds a decentralized alternative to Twitter, he will most likely choose more sophisticated networks like Ethereum, which has proven its validity as a network with complex solutions built on top of it.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-teases-bitcoin-doge-and-cardano-cross-chain-for-decentralized-twitter,utoday,2022-04-16,17:44:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano's Profitability Remains Extremely Low, But Whales Are Still Accumulating Asset Actively","Cardano network and its underlying coin,  ADA , had a pretty successful start to 2022, with a more than 54% pump in March that gave hope to all investors that the coin is finally breaking through the long-term downtrend and may finally retrace but, unfortunately, it was not the case as the coin's  profitability  remains below 20%. The asset's profitability is a strong metric that allows us to measure the effectiveness of an asset as an investment tool since it reflects the percentage of previous investors that remain in  profit . The profitability metric can also act as an ""overbought"" and ""oversold"" signal generator. Whenever an asset's profitability reaches or exceeds 90%, traders or investors are more likely to take profits, which then causes a cascade of liquidations and further reversal of the uptrend. In the opposite case, when the asset's profitability is extremely low, it is more likely that more fresh buying power will pour into it as  traders  at a massive loss are less likely to sell at the bottom. This creates an opportunity for upwards movement. Despite being one of the most fundamentally developed projects in the industry, Cardano does not seem to be popular among retail and institutional investors as it almost completely missed the bullrun between September and November. But showing relatively weak performance in the last months of 2021, back in August,  Cardano  was the most actively growing cryptocurrency on the market following the announcement of smart contracts technology. The most recent rally was also based on the release of numerous DeFi projects and solutions that have gradually increased Cardano's usage, hence, the demand for the underlying ADA coin.",https://u.today/cardanos-profitability-remains-extremely-low-but-whales-are-still-accumulating-asset-actively,utoday,2022-04-17,15:11:00,en

As the chart of the first cryptocurrency suggests, traders failed to maintain the previously established support level, which caused a drop below $39,000. Bitcoin had already plunged below the support previously but only as a candle's shadow, which is not usually considered a breach of the support. In the current case,  Bitcoin  had an opening right at the trend line, so it may still bounce back, leaving the support impenetrable as of yet. As for liquidations, 95% of liquidated orders were longs, with Okex providing 45% of the total volume. There is no fundamental or any other specific reason behind the drop, which may have caused traders to immediately sell their holdings. But we may highlight the unusual tendencies noticed during the last week as traders were actively moving liquidity away from exchanges. According to Glassnode data, $6.5 billion worth of Bitcoin were moved from exchanges last week. With more liquidity leaving trading platforms, the appearance of major selling pressure caused more significant price moves. Besides massive amounts of Bitcoin leaving exchanges, other cryptocurrencies like  Ethereum  are also facing a supply crisis after traders moved $4.3 billion worth of Ether from exchanges.

Between April 12 and April 13, the project gained over $41 million in total value of funds locked in the project. Such a strong increase shown on the tracking service is not actually tied to natural demand. The strong spike is caused by the official release of the platform, and $500,000 remaining there prior to the listing were most likely owned by users participating in the closed testing of the DEX.

In his detailed analysis, Mr. Sooraj indicated the most crucial Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs) that are set to be included in Vasil's hardfork agenda. #Cardano  is anticipating a new wave of upgrades with the Vasil HFC event on the 29th of June 2022 
 
Upgrades on Plutus-  #Cardano 's smart contract platform (CIPs) 
 
are among the most anticipated components of this HFC event 
 
Here’s a breakdown of each one of those upgrades:??  pic.twitter.com/bmU4U2bRkt First of all, CIP 33 will reconsider the logics of how the Plutus scripts (compiled Haskell programs) are submitted to the blockchain. This will reduce the usage of data and increase the net throughput of Cardano (ADA). The CIP 31 upgrade allows dApps to access transactional outputs without the necessity to spend and recreate them. This will solve the  ""one transaction per block""  issue bashed by Cardano (ADA) critics. The CIP 32 upgrade will allow Cardano (ADA) users to store data on-chain ""seamlessly,"" which, in turn, will advance the decentralization and adoption of the blockchain. Last but not least, the CIP 40 upgrade is designed to advance DDoS-protection of Cardano (ADA) and protect users from losing their ADA collateral. The Vasil hardfork is scheduled for June 29, 2022. Once implemented, it improves smart contracts capabilities and the user experience for Cardano (ADA) users and developers.

According to a Tuesday Twitter post from Cardano creators Input Output (IOHK), there are nearly 900 projects in development on the network. The figure has grown by roughly 400 since March 11, after IOHK Vice President Tim Harrison  stated  that the total stood at around 500 via Linkedin post.  As of today, nearly 900 projects are  #BuildingOnCardano ⚒️ And this number goes up day by day. Keeping track of all the news from this incredible ecosystem is not easy & this is why every week we compile an ecosystem digest with highlights & updates. ⤵️ #Cardano   $ADA — Input Output (@InputOutputHK)  April 18, 2022 
 
 Cardano is a public and decentralized proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchain that was created by Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson in 2017 after he left the team over disputes on the future direction of the network.  Pointing to some of the positive developments on Cardano over the past 10 days, IOHK highlighted six projects ranging from token swaps to decentralized finance (DeFi) applications that went live on the mainnet, entered test nets or launched via open beta.  One new project getting considerable attention is the AGIX ERC-20 Converter Bride, which was developed in collaboration with SingularityNET.  The tool went live this week and it enables users to bridge over Ethereum-based ERC-20 Tokens for use on Cardano, with the network’s DeFi sector expected to be a significant beneficiary.  After all these years Cardano has finally found utility, to copy Ethereum.  https://t.co/kdwaZaQJGf — MatiGreenspan.near (@MatiGreenspan)  April 18, 2022 
 
 Despite increasing numbers of projects in development, the number of decentralized applications (DApps) up and running on Cardano appears to be limited, with DefiLlama listing just 10 different platforms accounting for $224.96 worth of total value locked (TVL). Notably, four of those platforms have $0 TVL also outside of their native tokens.  On the nonfungible token (NFT) side of things, Cardano doesn’t even make the top 15 blockchains in terms of sales volume over the past 24 hours, despite fifteenth ranked Theta only generating $375 during that period.  It has been a slow burn for Cardano since  launching smart contracts  in September, with the network yet to fully take off and provide the promised competition to Ethereum, or even fellow “ETH killers” such as Solana, Avalanche and Flow.  However, founder Charles Hoskinson recently suggested in a video posted to his YouTube channel that the tide could soon turn with the  upcoming Vasil Hard Fork  upgrade in June. He stated that it will  provide  a “massive performance improvement to Cardano” and its smart contract capabilities.   Related:  67% of Cardano holders underwater and most bought less than 1 year ago ADA Wallet surge  One area of strong growth at the moment is wallet activity on Cardano, with data from Cardano Blockchain insights showing that the number of ADA wallets has increased by 100,000 since March 22.

In light of this, Cardano's parent company, IOHK, shares a technical briefing, explaining the nitty-gritty details of Plutus and interaction with smart contracts using Plutus Core scripts. #Cardano  & its smart contract platform,  #Plutus , are set to undergo significant enhancements in June’s HF.

?⤵️  pic.twitter.com/6nDi5vQJSb Explaining in a thread of tweets, Plutus Core is Cardano's native smart contract language that provides a safe programming environment to create scripts with Haskell. Plutus Core scripts enable the creation of dApps and multi-asset support on the blockchain (i.e., anyone can create their tokens). Interacting with a Plutus contract differs from interacting with an Ethereum contract as Plutus Core scripts do not go on-chain until used in a transaction. Founder Charles Hoskinson recently expressed positive expectations that the upcoming Vasil Hard Fork upgrade in June might provide a ""massive performance improvement to Cardano"" and its smart contract capabilities. The Vasil hard fork is scheduled for June 29 and aims to improve smart contracts capabilities and the user experience for Cardano developers, once implemented. As previously covered by  U.Today , the AGIX ERC-20 Converter Bride, which was developed in collaboration with SingularityNET, went live this week, and it enables users to bridge over Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens for use on Cardano, with the network's DeFi sector expected to be a significant beneficiary. Cardano also reports another step in interoperability as Cardano-based assets can now move between chains seamlessly. Milkomeda has announced a recent update that enables the transfer of assets to Cardano from Milkomeda C1. This includes stablecoins like USDC and USDT. In recent updates shared by IOHK, there are nearly 900 projects in development on the network. The figure has grown by roughly 400 since March, after IOHK Vice President Tim Harrison shared that the total stood at around 500.",https://u.today/iohk-shares-technical-briefing-on-cardanos-vasil-hard-fork-details,utoday,2022-04-21,16:15:00,en

However, on June 23, 2021, McAfee  was found dead  in a Spanish prison where he had been awaiting to be deported to the U.S. to do jail time for averting tax payments for roughly eight years. The official version is that McAfee took his own life by hanging himself. However, his wife Janice doubts that and insisted on an investigation. Prior to his death, McAfee frequently discussed the suicide of imprisoned U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was also found dead in his prison cell. McAfee believes that his death was a setup and stated that if here were found dead in the same circumstances, it would not be a suicide. The former CEO of McAfee Associates was a renowned libertarian who often poured harsh criticism on the U.S. government and law enforcement organizations. McAfee believed taxes to be unconstitutional.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Takes Aim at Bitcoin Mining Centralization,"In a recent tweet, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  sparred  with Blockstream CEO Adam Back over the centralization of the leading distributed consensus mechanisms in the cryptocurrency industry. Back has opined that proof-of-stake is inherently plutocratic since decisions are made based on the number of tokens stakeholders hold. The rules and upgrades of a certain blockchain protocol are primarily made by the wealthiest participants, thus creating oligopolistic cryptocurrency systems. In turn, Hoskinson took aim at the centralization of Bitcoin mining by attaching a pie chart, which highlights the fact that only a handful of mining pools control the entire network. In a separate tweet, Hoskinson says that there are no individual miners left due to the proliferation of highly complicated equipment and the emergence of a highly professionalized multibillion-dollar business. 
 
Some critics believe that Bitcoin has strayed out from what is supposed to be due to such an unhealthy level of centralization. In 2018, Bitmain-controlled mining pools gained control of nearly 51% of the Bitcoin hashrate, which brought them alarmingly close to potentially coordinating to attack the network. 
 
Bitcoiners tend to brush off such concerns, claiming that mining is not even supposed to be widely distributed since it is very costly to attack Bitcoin.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-takes-aim-at-bitcoin-mining-centralization,utoday,2022-04-22,09:00:00,en

Filan Gives XRP Lawsuit Timelines: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today presents you with the top four news stories over the past day. With daily announcements about the largest addresses on the market buying billions of  SHIB , it is important to break down exactly why they are doing that. The first reason is whales’ desire to to take control of the asset's circulation, with Shiba Inu remaining the biggest USD-valued position among Ethereum whales. Second,  SHIB  lost more than 70% of its value since the ATH, which makes the Risk/Reward ratio in the event of another rally appealing for investors. Third, SHIB has “meme potential,” which means that the asset may stage a strong rally with no fundamental reasons behind it. According to CryptoLaw founder John Deaton, San Francisco-based company  Ripple  and the Securities and Exchange Commission are expected to file a joint proposed scheduling order to Judge Torres today, April 22. He believes that the parties will agree to an early June deadline for motions, with responses due by the end of June. However, defense lawyer James K. Filan stated that a June timeline for briefings might not be feasible. In his opinion, a more realistic timeline for summary judgment motions would be opening briefs in either July or August and then all briefings completed by either October or November.

Destroying canine coins makes them more scarce, which can potentially boost their price. Contributors to reducing the SHIB supply will be able to receive rewards in the form of burntSHIB tokens.

cardano,No Section,CyberCapital CIO Highlights Why Cardano Is Lagging Behind Other Networks,"The CIO of cryptocurrency investing fund CyberCapital, Justin Bons, described on his personal  Twitter page  why the Cardano network was propped up by false promises and remains outdated and ""least capable"" among competition on the  market . The thread began with the description of all of the problems the newly emerged ADA smart contract platform has. According to Bons, it is not properly optimized and cannot handle capacity increases and fast processing because of script execution. With the further development of solutions on the Cardano network, it may become a bottleneck for all projects. In addition to problems with processing, Bons highlighted the economic issues of the network, which is a lack of any sort of fee market. All transactions on Cardano are being processed on a ""first seen basis"" with no prioritization of transactions. The main problem with such a mechanism is the possibility of a spam attack, which will block the usage of  ADA . On the other hand, which the CyberCapital CEO prefers not to mention, such a mechanism opens up the network for anyone making it more effective in terms of payments and transaction costs, contrary to networks like  Ethereum  which, when congested, may demand up to $100 per transaction.

Unfortunately for Charles, the technology was not implemented and the promise was forgotten. The expert also noted that this is not the only promise Cardano management gave to ADA holders.

In a tweet published on April 25, Hoskinson stated that the Tesla boss was the only person who has promised to ban crypto scam giveaway bots on Twitter ""or die trying."" Therefore, Hosk expects this social media platform to significantly improve under its new leader. I will remind everyone that Elon was the only person to promise to get rid of crypto giveaway bots. I cannot wait to see Twitter become a significantly better company under new leadership.  https://t.co/RZZ3KHBG4J Previously, Cardano and the  IOHK founder tweeted  that he was happy to build a decentralized social media platform from scratch with Elon Musk should his  bid to buy Twitter  be rejected. However, yesterday, it was reported that the Twitter board approved the buyout for Musk for roughly $44 billion in cash. Some believe that the Tesla boss will have to sell some of his TSLA shares in order to fund the purchase. Two major investors and fund managers have posted their comments on Twitter regarding the approved buyout deal—Mike Novogratz (CEO and founder of Galaxy Digital) and Peter Schiff (chairman of SchiffGold, Bitcoin hater who prefers gold as an inflation hedge). Novogratz's tweet mirrored that of Hoskinson, as Novo expects Musk to clean Twitter of crypto scam bots. He stated that even if Musk's management style does not suit everyone, if he keeps his word about the bots, that alone would be worth gratitude. the hysteria around  @elonmusk  buying Twitter is unsettling. While his style might not be for everyone, he usually does what he says he is going to do. Give him a chance to remove the bots. For that alone we will all be thanking him. It also will be a boon for  @DefeatByTweet  ? Schiff has taken this deal as a chance to criticize Musk, assuming that the centibillionaire may now have to sell his Tesla stock to ensure the funding. This would be convenient for Musk, Schiff believes, as he expects ""the Tesla bubble to pop"" at some point, and now Elon will be able to sell TSLA at a higher price rather than having to sell at a discount later on. Since  @elonmusk  is actually buying  #Twitter  the smart move is to sell  $TSLA . At some point the  #Tesla  bubble will pop, and Musk's shares will be force-sold after the collapse to cover his margin debt. Given the size of his position the block will likely trade at a large discount. Besides, Schiff pointed out that he did not expect Musk to actually buy Twitter, adding that it is not the first time he ""overestimated an investor's intelligence.""",https://u.today/cardano-founder-expects-significant-improvements-in-twitter-under-musks-leadership-heres-why,utoday,2022-04-26,10:52:00,en

The app now supports smart contracts, which is one of its new features. This implies that users will be able to interact with smart contracts straight from the Cardano app. Moving the chains. Great work ledger  https://t.co/YW5Q7nMPOH Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  shares this positive news while commending Ledger for its great work. Cardano's network update, Alonzo, in September 2021 ushered in smart contract functionality. The creation and deployment of smart contracts, which are pieces of code that self execute when predefined conditions are met, were enabled on the Cardano mainnet. Cardano and its smart contracts platform, Plutus, are set to undergo significant enhancements in June's hard fork. Founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that the upcoming  Vasil Hard Fork  upgrade in June will provide a ""massive performance improvement to Cardano"" and its smart contract capabilities. The Vasil hard fork is scheduled for June 29, 2022, and aims to improve smart contracts capabilities and the user experience for Cardano users and developers once implemented. In the latest updates to the network, IOHK developers have increased the block size by 10%, which is an increment of 8 kilobytes to the 80 Kb of current block size. This upgrade comes on the wave of Cardano network improvements that have been planned for this year by Cardano. Presently, there are nearly 900 projects in development on the network. The figure has grown by roughly 400 since March after IOHK Vice President Tim Harrison shared that the total stood at around 500.",https://u.today/cardano-ledger-app-receives-new-smart-contract-compatibility-updates-details,utoday,2022-04-27,10:09:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Announces New Collaboration to Promote Interoperability; Here's What to Know,"As shared by  Tim Harrison , IOHK's vice president of community and ecosystem, Cardano's parent company IOHK and Wanchain are collaborating on enabling interoperability between the Cardano mainnet, Cardano sidechains and other blockchain networks. Here, Wanchain will become an EVM-compatible sidechain to Cardano. The journey continues ?  #Cardano   https://t.co/8BUj6DJzMA As stated in a  blog post , both teams, IOHK and Wanchain, will work together to deploy directional cross-chain bridges that will connect Cardano to other Layer 1 blockchains. Wanchain bridge nodes will also be updated to peg the Wanchain and Cardano networks, making Cardano's cross-chain bridges and transactions even safer. More than fifteen Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks are currently connected via Wanchain bridges. Cardano's inclusion in this broad network of blockchains connects the Cardano network to other DeFi and Web3 ecosystems, expanding both potential use cases for ADA holders on other chains and the possibility of BTC, ETH, DOT, WAN, XRP and other coins being used in Cardano's own dApp ecosystem. In recent months, Cardano has reached several milestones in interoperability while announcing new partnerships and integration. As previously covered by  U.Today , the AGIX ERC-20 Converter Bridge, which was developed in collaboration with SingularityNET, was recently launched. Its functionality allows users to bridge Ethereum-based ERC-20 tokens to Cardano, with the DeFi sector expected to benefit the most. Also in March, the Milkomeda Foundation announced the launch of C1, an EVM compatible sidechain connected directly to the Cardano blockchain. This allows users to seamlessly transfer assets between the two blockchains, allowing Ethereum-based dApps to function on top of Cardano through the use of wrapped smart contract technology. In another recent collaboration, Cardano's commercial arm,  EMURGO , unveiled its partnership with Blockpass to onboard on-chain KYC in its regulatory compliance bid. Through this collaboration, Blockpass will add Cardano crypto addresses to the Blockpass app and offer on-chain KYC services for Cardano ecosystem projects, optimizing their KYC requirements.",https://u.today/cardano-announces-new-collaboration-to-promote-interoperability-heres-what-to-know,utoday,2022-04-27,13:27:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano's Number of Holders Exceeds 3.6 Million as ADA Reaches Year's Bottom,"The hold count on  Cardano  has recently exceeded 3.6 million wallets as the price of underlying coin reached March's bottom of $0.8, according to Messari on-chain and market data  aggregator . The increasing number of Cardano holders suggests the overall growth of the network despite the questionable market performance of ADA cryptocurrency. The divergence between market and fundamental factors may be a reassuring factor for long-term holders of Cardano as the  market  performance of the asset usually catches up with the growth of the project. Currently, addresses holding around 100 ADA are the biggest representatives of the  network , while only 3,042 holders have more than 1 million ADA on their balance. Compared to other networks, it is clear that ADA has more millionaire whales compared to similar networks. Such distribution is also possible due to the relatively low price of ADA on the market. ADA has, in fact, reached the 2022 absolute bottom in terms of a price, as it now trades around $0.78. Such a strong drop occurred after Cardano pumped by 55% following the growing number of  DeFi  solutions on the network. Previously, ADA was moving in the prolonged downturn caused by the speculative nature of the last pump of ADA, fueled by the smart-contract technology announcement. The problem was that the first working solutions on ADA were delivered months after the release, which is why the market lost interest in the coin.",https://u.today/cardanos-number-of-holders-exceeds-36-million-as-ada-reaches-years-bottom,utoday,2022-04-27,12:38:00,en
cardano,Tech,Cardano Network Developers Increase Block Size by 10%,"A new upgrade on Cardano has seen the network’s block size increase by 10%, as per developers earlier this week. “Before the weekend, an update proposal was made to increase #Cardano mainnet block size by 8K,” said Cardano development firm Input Output in a  tweet . “The current block size is 80KB, and after this change, it will be 88KB.” Blocks are batches of transactions that are confirmed and recorded on a blockchain. Larger sizes mean more transactions can be included in each batch, but it can affect transaction times and overall network capacity. Input Output said the 10% increase in block size network would help increase data throughput and scalability. The performance of decentralized applications, or services that rely on smart contracts, on Cardano is additionally expected to improve. Input Output added it would monitor network performance and behavior closely over the next five days to determine the next required increase in block size. The previous increase came earlier in February when block sizes expanded from 72KB to 80KB at the time. The step comes ahead of Cardano’s eventual Basho upgrade, which would introduce sidechains on the network.  Sidechains  are a separate blockchain network that connect to another blockchain – called a parent blockchain or mainnet – via a two-way peg. Meanwhile, the fundamental improvement did little to buffer the price of Cardano’s ADA token amid a declining sentiment in the broader crypto market. ADA fell 8.3% in the past 24 hours, one of the biggest losers among major tokens, as bitcoin (BTC) lost support at $40,000 and slumped to the $38,000 level. ADA traded around the $0.90 mark on Tuesday but  declined sharply  to the $0.82 level on Wednesday morning before slightly recovering at press time.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/04/27/cardano-network-developers-increase-block-size-by-10/,coindesk,2022-04-27,07:56:00,en

This is reflected in the surge of the total value locked (TVL) from roughly $268 million on April 27 to $278 million on April 28. Without the inclusion of staked governance tokens in TVL valuation, Cardano's TVL stands at about $203 million. While the increase might seem insignificant, Cardano's TVL (staking included) has steadily declined since peaking at $434.74 million on March 28. Total Value Locked (TVL) refers to the total worth of crypto assets deposited in a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol—or in DeFi protocols. Cardano had witnessed growth in its TVL after the launch of projects Sundaeswap and Minswap, which contributed immensely to this metric. The ADA price is currently consolidating after testing lows of $0.816 on April 26. At the time of publication, ADA was trading down 1.67% for the day at $0.828. At its present price, ADA remains down 73.29% from its all-time highs of $3.10 attained in September 2021. Despite the price drop, Cardano continues to mark significant milestones.

Most likely, it will take weeks or even months until  Cardano-based  dApps receive  updates . The reconsideration of Plutus script's logic, submitting to a new blockchain and other advantages we have described in the most recent Vasil-related article will most likely reach specific decentralized apps with a delay. The main reason is tied to the complicated process of transfer of solutions based on the current version of the blockchain to the new foundation. Most users believe that solutions that already function in the space like Minswap and SundaeSwap will need months to rewrite a massive amount of scripts and make a complete audit. Whenever the network implements new features via hardfork, solutions based on it are applying recent changes relatively slowly. We could compare the same process with  Ethereum's  EIP-1559 update that brought a fee burning mechanism that was fully implemented by all pools only a month after. Users are not happy with Cardano-based apps' tendency to slowly implement new updates. ""Thanks"" to the slow implementation process, the newly emerged smart-contract technology announced back in August 2021 is only now getting recognition in the blockchain sphere. The first fundamental effect felt by cryptocurrency users was noticed only in March when numerous decentralized applications like Minswap, SundaeSwap and  Wingriders  were fully released, attracting more than $300 million in TVL and pushing ADA's into a new 50% rally.",https://u.today/cardanos-vasil-network-implementation-in-project-to-be-delayed-for-months-heres-why,utoday,2022-04-28,10:17:00,en

As the crypto ecosystem builder co-founder Sebastien Guillemot noted, recently released DeFi platform Wingriders is offering $7 million USD-based stablecoins. According to the developer, anyone can wrap their USDC/USDT in Cardano by using only two bridges: Nomadxyz and Milkomeda. Both projects that allow usage of stablecoins on Cardano are open to any user. Djed is an algorithmic stablecoin so it definitely comes with its own risks as well. It depends whether or not you want to learn about the risks of a bridge or learn about the risks of the algorithmic stable coin's adjustment mechanism Some Cardano enthusiasts expressed their concerns with using bridges as they bring more risks during transfers and are less user-friendly. But Guilemot shed some light on algorithmic stablecoins widely used by  crypto  enthusiasts as they bring their own risks, as well depending on the change mechanism. Algorithmic stablecoins are one of the most common types of assets in the cryptocurrency market as it offers easy-to-use solutions accepted by numerous centralized and decentralized cryptocurrency  exchanges . But before using each algorithm, it is better to become educated on the type of mechanism used by it as a wrong configuration in the coin's code may bring various risks to its users and even cause a decoupling. Back in the summer of 2021, users were actively criticizing the biggest stablecoin on the market, Tether, which is being used on three chains: Tron, Ethereum and Omni. The main concern of crypto users was the fact that it was not clear if Tether held any illegal papers to back their stable asset.

Following the discussion of the latest upgrades to Cardano (ADA) blockchain and its infrastructure, an anonymous Crypto Twitter enthusiast asked IOG's Matthias Benkort (@_KtorZ_) about the details of Hydra's design. Voilà! 
 
The first building block being basic Hydra heads, then incremental commits, then inter-head etc... The exact order depends on what people will need and request. In a similar fashion features of the core head are user-driven; so come and tell us what you need.  https://t.co/TfLZnrCq8l Mr. Benkort was asked about the modular design of Hydra that could allow the deployment of various decentralized applications (dApps) to its infrastructure. The developer confirmed that Hydra will be able to onboard dApps with different structures using its separate elements (""Heads"") in a Lego-like manner. Also, the exact design of Hydra and the roadmap of its progress will depend on the requests of community representatives; some features of the core ""Head"" are already 100% up to the community. As covered by U.Today previously, Hydra is an ecosystem of Layer 2 scalability solutions for Cardano (ADA). Being among the first protocols of this type, Hydra is set to surpass mainstream Ethereum-based L2 protocols, including the likes of Optimism (OP) and Arbitrum. Meanwhile, the Cardano (ADA) ecosystem inches closer to Vasil, its most significant upgrade since the implementation of smart contracts in Q3, 2021. As such, Cardano (ADA) strengthens its infrastructure for the DeFi segment: its pioneering algorithmic stablecoin Djed, developed in collaboration with COTI Network, is now  available  on some major decentralized finance protocols.",https://u.today/cardanos-first-ever-l2-solution-hydra-to-work-in-lego-like-manner,utoday,2022-04-30,16:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Might Be Less Than 75% Utilized Capacity of Ethereum: Report,"According to data shared by  Cardano blockchain insights , Cardano might be operating at 25% utilized capacity of Ethereum. The analogy goes thus: Cardano presently has over 100,000 transactions which, on average, comprise three payments, as one transaction per the metric supplied can be a payment from one or several addresses to many different addresses. Ethereum, on the other hand, has around 1.1 million daily transactions on average. Since  #Cardano  has now ca 100k transactions which currently contains on average 3 payments and Ethereum has about 1.1 mln transactions on averageper day, it is safe to conclude that Cardano network is about 36% utilized capacity of Ethereum. 
 
Doesn't look like?chain to us.  pic.twitter.com/NCCHSweQ6Z The Cardano network has reached several milestones in recent months.  Over the weekend , IOHK shared statistics regarding network growth in a chart provided. Currently, 925 projects are being built on Cardano, up from 917 previously. Fifty projects have recently launched on Cardano, while the number of NFT projects is at 5,441. Github connects also totaled 2,995, while Cardano native tokens stood at 4.5 million. The number of wallets holding the ADA token recently surpassed the 3.6 million count. 
Despite the developments, Cardano did suffer a significant backlash. One of the most common criticisms has to be its comparison to a ""ghost chain."" Overall, the Cardano blockchain might be said to have evolved significantly, with a Santiment report indicating that Cardano was the most developed cryptocurrency network on Github in 2021. A critical parameter change took place last week, in which block size was increased from 80KB to 88KB to allow for more transactions and scripts in a single block. Cardano and its Plutus smart contract platform are also set to undergo a major update in June, dubbed the ""Vasil hard fork."" Despite this, Cardano participants and the community as a whole are not relenting on Cardano's wider adoption. As indicated in a recent IOG blog post, the capacity to work with other blockchains, or interoperability, is crucial. Along these lines, Input-Output Global plans to release a new permissionless EVM sidechain this year. This sidechain aims to make it possible for Cardano developers to write Solidity smart contracts and create EVM-compatible dApps and ERC20-compatible tokens. Amid a spate of developments, the  ADA price  has failed to keep pace with recent progress. At a present price of $0.787, the ADA price remains down 74.6% from its all-time high of $3.10 reached in September 2021.",https://u.today/cardano-might-be-less-than-75-utilized-capacity-of-ethereum-report,utoday,2022-05-02,09:59:00,en

The tweet gathered the most recent negative events from each network, including Ethereum, Cardano and Solana. But while the wealth manager highlighted functionality and performance issues on the two networks, Cardano's critique was not of the fundamental issues of the network. Solana is broken. Ethereum gas fees are so high that it's essentially unusable. Cardano is going to zero. 
 
Meanwhile,  #Bitcoin  issues a new block every 10 minutes like clockwork. 
 
This isn't rocket science, folks. Alfred noted that Cardano's market performance was far from being acceptable by the cryptocurrency market standard, but the network keeps on growing, allowing developers to build scalable, cheap and efficient decentralized solutions and applications. Following the minting of lands in the Otherside Metaverse related to the Bored Ape Yacht Club, the Ethereum network became highly congested, causing a record-breaking spike in transaction fees. According to the  Ethereum  blockchain explorer, a random user paid $40,000 in fees for a simple mint. The spike in fees caused a massive controversy in the cryptocurrency community. One side accused Yuga Labs of inappropriate smart contract optimization, while others criticized Ethereum's inability to scale properly. Solana's stability is a long-lasting meme in the crypto community as some users constantly make fun of the ""Ethereum killer,"" which constantly goes down after the number of transactions rises above average. Recently, Solana was down for hours after a spam transaction attack. The downtime on Solana was ironic as Ethereum beat the record in the number of fees generated in 24 hours.",https://u.today/wealth-manager-mike-alfred-may-have-left-secret-message-for-cardano-community-in-his-recent-tweet,utoday,2022-05-02,12:48:00,en

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano price drops to level that sparked a 65% ADA rally in March — Will history repeat? ,"Cardano ( ADA ) price has been rebounding after falling to its worst levels since February 2021. Meanwhile, a technical fractal suggests that ADA's upside retracement could continue in the coming weeks. Can ADA price extend the recovery? ADA's price has started bouncing  after testing the same support area that preceded a 65% bull run in March 2022.  Specifically, ADA/USD witnessed a bullish rejection as its price fell below $0.75 on Feb. 24, a move that followed a short period of sideways consolidation.  It later broke out of the flat price range, rising to $1.24 on March 26, indicating a strong buying sentiment near the area around the $0.75-level (the red bar in the chart below). ADA/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView The March 2022 fractal also showed ADA's three-day relative strength index (RSI) treading near its oversold threshold of 30. The momentum indicator has returned to near the same level as ADA consolidates inside the flat range. As a result of this fractal, Cardano eyes a sharp rebound from $0.75 in May 2022, with its interim upside target around $1, a level that coincides with the upper trendline of ADA's prevailing descending channel pattern.

ADA whales buying the dip Cardano can also undergo a sharp rebound because of strong accumulation sentiment. Notably, Cardano's richest investors, or ""whales"" that hold between 1 million ADA and 10 million ADA, have added 196 million ADA (worth $147 million at May 3's price) to their addresses in the past five weeks, on-chain data from Santiment shows.

Today, May 4, 2022, the IOG team published a  blog post  to cover the latest addition to its ecosystem of dApps, anti-counterfeit solution Atala SCAN. Product authentication tech has numerous applications across multiple industries. A smart NTAG microchip linked to a blockchain can defeat counterfeiters. With the Atala SCAN app consumers will be able to look up a product on  #Cardano  & check if is genuine  https://t.co/qhriWdsSG1 The new protocol is built on top of ""touch-chip"" technology: it utilizes micro-chips as ""smart seals"" that verify the authenticity of this or that drug or spirit. Atala SCAN equips this seal with an auditable link that can display full information about the production and distribution cycle of the product. Atala SCAN utilizes the largest Proof-of-Stake (PoS) network Cardano (ADA) as its technical platform; it guarantees the integrity and visibility of all data within the system. Per the statement, this design has a number of advantages over ""seals, holograms and fancy packaging,"" the previous generation of verification tools. Juan Ignacio Sierra, the Atala SCAN project manager, is certain that the new platform will change the narrative in anti-counterfeit mechanisms: Working with blockchain ensures the immutability of the product information, but if there's no mechanism in place to securely link the information to the product itself, fake products can take advantage of the same blockchain information as the originals do. In Atala SCAN we use high security cryptographic hardware in the seal to ensure the security of the link between the blockchain information and the physical product. Working with this system takes no special skills: the authenticity of a product can be checked through a smartphone in a couple of clicks. Thus, end users and watchdogs can start using it immediately upon mainnet launch. Atala SCAN's module is installed at the first point in the supply chain that delivers the product to the brand owner. The owner makes an entry about the product in its own register. Then, a special transaction for every item is created on the Cardano (ADA) blockchain. The brand owner can specify which information is disclosed to the end customer through the embedded smart chip. Besides authenticity data, it might include information about the ongoing marketing campaign.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-to-host-anti-counterfeit-platform-with-micro-chips,utoday,2022-05-04,15:17:00,en

According to recent  SHIB: The Metaverse  statistics shared by @shibaInuart, the number of current landowners stands above 5,100, with 18,700 plots bought so far. Over time, 100,595 more lands will be unlocked; during the first introductory phase, 36,431 lands will be revealed, and only 32,124 of them will be available for purchase. Some lands will remain locked as they will be used as common ground. Apart from that, Shiba Inu has gained more than 4,000 holders in just a few days. At the moment, the total number of SHIB holders comprises 1,143,515, per WhaleStats. MicroStrategy  is currently reporting a massive loss on its Bitcoin position, adding that if the flagship crypto plunges to $21,000, the company will face the first margin call, which would require it to additionally fund its existing position. However, MicroStrategy’s new CFO Phong Le is not worried about the risk of receiving the call thanks to the massive liquidity at the company's disposal. Before Bitcoin drops to $21,000, MicroStrategy will most likely provide funding for their position, averaging down their position and moving the margin call limit significantly lower. Whale Alert crypto tracker has spotted four transactions carrying nearly  19,000 BTC  from Coinbase crypto exchange to several unnamed digital wallets. The amount of BTC moved is worth roughly $703.5 million. The two largest transactions shifted 8,000 BTC and 7,794 BTC, comprising $300,543,330 and $293,180,231. The other two moved 1,000 and nearly 2,000 Bitcoins.

cardano,No Section,Cardano to Host Two Developer Events Ahead of Vasil Hard Fork,"According to  Tim Harrison , vice president of community and ecosystem at IOHK, Cardano will be hosting two developer events at the end of May and mid-June. The two developer events are expected to take place in Barcelona, Spain, and Austin, Texas, respectively. We're hosting two  #Cardano  developer events between end of May and mid June, in Barcelona (focus on audit and certification) and Austin, Tx (focus on Plutus plus some Marlowe) respectively. If you are  #buildingonCardano  and want to get involved,  @benohanlon  is your man ? The end of May event will focus on auditing and certification, while the Austin event in mid-June will focus on Plutus, the Cardano-based smart contract platform, and Marlowe, a language designed for developing and executing financial contracts on Cardano. Cardano and its smart contracts platform, Plutus, are set to undergo significant enhancements to June's hard fork. The Cardano Vasil hard fork event is slated to occur on June 29. As shared by  IOHK , certain Cardano improvement proposals (CIPs) are coming with June's hard fork. The upcoming Vasil update is set to introduce four different CIPs, which are CIP-31 (Reference Inputs), CIP-32 (Inline Datums), CIP-33 (Reference Scripts ) and CIP-40 (Collateral Outputs). CIPs coming with June's HF: 
 
CIPs (Cardano Improvement Proposals) present new features to the  #Cardano  network that are key to bettering our blockchain 
 
The upcoming HF introduces: 
CIP-31: Reference Inputs 
CIP-32: Inline Datums 
CIP-33: Reference Scripts 
CIP-40: Collateral Outputs  pic.twitter.com/bx8vOKDF3H IOHK went on to explain further. Reference inputs allow multiple DApps to be able to read from the same datum at the same time, improving concurrency. Inline datums allow data to be stored on-chain rather than just a hash of it, as Cardano currently does. This makes it easier for developers to interact with the script because they do not have to include the data. Reference scripts aim to help reduce transaction costs. Currently, new scripts need to be included in each transaction. With reference scripts, scripts can be interacted with through a reference, pushing it onto the chain. Interaction with a smart contract thus becomes minimal. Collateral outputs aim to improve the transaction validation experience. Currently, if a transaction fails validation, the collateral set aside for such scenarios is lost. With collateral outputs, only enough collateral is included to complete the transaction. The Cardano network has reached several milestones in recent months. According to recent updates, 925 projects are being built on Cardano. Cardano native tokens have also reached 4.5 million, while the number of wallets holding the ADA token recently surpassed the 3.6 million count.",https://u.today/cardano-to-host-two-developer-events-ahead-of-vasil-hard-fork,utoday,2022-05-05,15:48:00,en

In the meantime, Bitcoin has fallen below the $37,000 zone. Schiff believes that now that Bitcoin and the crypto market in general are plummeting, along with the stocks of companies working in the blockchain sphere, the whole crypto industry will be exposed as a ""malinvestment."" Many redundancies in these firms will force retail crypto investors to sell their holdings in order to pay for bills that are rising. #Bitcoin ,  #crypto , &  #blockchain  related stocks are getting decimated. Many of these companies will go bankrupt as the entire industry is exposed as malinvestment. Mass layoffs will result in mass selling of crypto as unemployed workers raise cash to pay soaring household bills. He has  also commented  on the overall excessive amount of new coins on the market, totaling 19,316. With the demand for various cryptocurrencies, he says, the overall decline in the capitalization of the crypto market in the past half-year has comprised 42%. He believes that, eventually, the supply of cryptocurrencies will exceed the overall market cap. In early January, Schiff expressed the view that the global leading cryptocurrency is likely to collapse  below the $30,000 support . Back then, Bitcoin was trading at the $35,000 level. Now, that BTC has been hit by the recent interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve by half a basis point (the highest rise in 22 years), the price has fallen to the $36,362 zone. The fall of Bitcoin is causing the rest of the crypto market's prices to go down as well.

cardano,No Section,Why Is Cardano's TVL So Small? Charles Hoskinson Attempts to Explain,"In a  recent tweet , Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson claims that Cardano's total value locked (TVL) is small because it does not take into account staked coins. Users are not required to lock ADA tokens to stake them. 
 
If they were added to the mix, the blockchain's TVL would hit $19 billion, according to Hoskison. This would make it the third-biggest smart contract platform. 
 
However, 0xngmi  tweeted  that DeFiLlama, a software engineer at popular decentralized finance TVL aggregator DefiLlama, refuted Hoskinson's comments, confirming that the platform does not count native staking at all. TVL has become the most popular metric for gauging the success of certain projects within the decentralized finance industry. 
 
According to data provided by decentralized finance aggregator  DefiLlama , Ethereum continues to dominate the DeFi sector with a total of $108.37 billion. Curve, a stablecoin-focused decentralized exchange, remains the biggest protocol by total value locked. Overall, Ethereum's share of the market stands at 55%, its lowest level ever. A year ago, Ethereum accounted for 67% of the DeFi sector. 
 
Terra and BNB Chain come in second and third places, respectively. They have $28.92 billion and $12 billion worth of total value locked, respectively. 
 
At press time, Cardano's TVL stands at $202 million, which puts it in a distant 32nd place. It is trading below Thera, EOS, Gnosis, Celo, Astar and other chains.

According to on-chain data provided by  Glassnode , the number of balances holding the asset for 30 days or fewer spiked by 186%. Data suggest that short-term traders are holding 36% of the cryptocurrency supply. Such a strong increase in short-term interest could be tied to both the market and fundamental conditions in which  Cardano  currently sits. Following the 50 bp rate hike by the Fed yesterday, a large portion of the cryptocurrency market felt relief, which led to the extremely short rally on the market, with some assets gaining up to 40% in one daily candle. Cardano also benefited from the relief on the market and gained 17% to its value, bringing hope to some long-term investors. The spike in the price may have attracted numerous retail investors that were looking for an entry into digital  assets . The massive and rich development process follows Cardano's path on the cryptocurrency market behind the scenes. Only at the beginning of April did the Cardano network report $300 million in funds locked in various decentralized platforms and smart contracts. As for now, Cardano awaits the delivery of various decentralized solutions and projects like the Djed stablecoin, which should become a bridge between fiat assets and Cardano's underlying coin.

?Enjoy testing ErgoDEX:  https://t.co/pfcUIBir6S With many innovative new products, the Cardano ecosystem is rapidly expanding. Djed, a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin, became live in public testnet recently. Cardano founder and IOHK CEO, Charles Hoskinson, notes this as a major milestone for algorithmic stablecoins, saying ""DJED is live on the testnet. This is a major milestone for all algorithmic stablecoins."" Hoskinson recently stated that Bitcoin's UTXO model has not moved so far because of its limited programmability. The IOHK CEO noted that the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) accounting model that Cardano uses seems ""the logical next step."" Bitcoin uses the UTXO model, while the second largest cryptocurrency Ethereum uses the account-based model, which represents assets as balances. The EUTXO design, according to Cardano developers, is preferable to Ethereum's account-based paradigm. This is because two or more parties can control the same data owing to a ""far larger"" surface area for attack. The EUTXO model also features great parallelism and scalability. The Cardano founder believes that the model is what Ethereum developers are ""fundamentally missing,"" saying that Satoshi Nakamoto, the mysterious Bitcoin creator, dropped the account-based model Ethereum currently uses because of its deficiencies. In a recent tweet, Input-Output CEO Charles Hoskinson claims if staked coins were added to Cardano's TVL, the blockchain's TVL would be more than $19 billion.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Highlights Best Part of Cardano's eUTxO Architecture,"Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson , in a recent tweet, highlights the best part of Cardano's EUXTO model: superior knowledge of functional programming. The best part of EUTXO is that it exposes how little some DApp developers know about functional programming. Cardano , similarly to Bitcoin, is an Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO)-based blockchain, which uses a different accounting model for its ledger from other account-based blockchains, such as Ethereum. Cardano, on the other hand, uses an innovative Extended Unspent Transaction Output (EUTXO) model, which was introduced by the Alonzo upgrade to support multi-assets and smart contracts. 1/14) Cardano has made major trade offs by relying on a UTXO model instead of a account model 
 
The disadvantages of a UTXO model far outweigh the advantages 
 
From a worse user experience, 
 
To ADA smart contracts being far more limited 
 
I will cover these fundamental flaws here: This comes amid critical remarks made by the founder and CIO of CyberCapital,  Justin Bonus,  who cited that Cardano has made major trade-offs by relying on a UTXO model instead of an account model. The CyberCapital CIO had cited limited interoperability between smart contracts as part of the ""fundamental flaws"" of EUXTO architecture. He says that while this may restrict the types of contracts that can be built on Cardano, ""The trade-off for the loss in concurrency is parallelism which gives scalability advantages."" This is the case because EUTXO expands the UTXO model by allowing output addresses to incorporate complex logic to determine which transactions can unlock them. And by adding custom data to all outputs, a significant degree of parallelism is feasible due to the ""local"" nature of transaction validation. The EUTXO paradigm appears to have more advantages, such as increased security and predictability in smart contract execution costs, and more powerful parallelization. According to  CoinMarketCap  data, Cardano has flipped Terra (LUNA) to rank 8th largest in terms of market capitalization. With a present market valuation of $25.27 billion, Cardano now ranks ahead of Terra, whose present market capitalization is $21.85 billion. As  U.Today  previously reported, Cardano pulled in a surprise recovery on May 4 before the latest price retreat. On-chain data indicates an accumulation spree among whales and a spike in retail interest. IntoTheBlock recently reported that balances held by traders, which refer to addresses holding for less than 30 days, have surged by about 186% in the last 30 days or so.

Following massive outflows from UST on Anchor, holders of the stablecoin had to witness a brief de-pegging, which caused the price of the stablecoin to drop below $1. To regulate the prices of stable assets, the foundation had to sell some of their BTC holdings, which added even more pressure to the poorly performing asset. It is not yet clear how much of their funds Terra Foundation sold, but it will not be an unnoticeable amount as Anchor reported $2.3 billion in outflows, indicating massive outflows from the stable asset. While there are at least two reasons behind the increased outflows, the major cause is tied to increasing volatility on the cryptocurrency market, followed by increased demand in exit  liquidity . As Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies plunge further down, panic sentiment has overtaken the market and is causing massive outflows from both stable and regular digital assets. According to CoinMarketCap, the market has lost at least $200 billion in capitalization. The second reason that fueled the outflows could be tied to the release of USDD stablecoin by  Tron , which will offer greater rates for liquidity provision at the start of the project.

Terra's native asset, LUNA, also declined more than 50% as the incident fueled negative sentiment among Terra holders. These markets aren't going to be defined by first to market or fastest to get network effect. They are always going to be defined by best under stress and most durable. The long term will always eat the daily drama and volatility UST's challenge came over the weekend as hundreds of millions of UST were sold on Anchor, Terra's native lending platform, as well as Curve and Binance, resulting in accusations of a ""coordinated attack"" on the UST stablecoin. On Monday, Luna Foundation (LFG) stated that it was taking steps to ""proactively defend the stability"" of UST. That includes lending $750 million worth of Bitcoin to trading firms to ""protect the UST peg"" and a further 750 million in UST being lent out to buy more Bitcoin ""as market conditions normalize."" This, however, failed to assuage the situation. While all this was going on, crypto pundits  criticized UST  while questioning its decentralized status. Concerns about the viability of UST's economic model have resurfaced as it battles to preserve its $1 peg. And that's only going to grow. Cardano has its own growth fund and its decentralized!  https://t.co/uzTUaciMPE Stablecoins are designed to maintain a peg to the value of currencies like the U.S. dollar, and traditional types of these tokens are backed by fiat assets. UST, on the other hand, is an algorithmic stablecoin with no such asset backing, relying instead on trade and treasury management to maintain its value. Though Terra's algorithmic stablecoin, UST, may be the first to debut, it is unlikely to be the last, as several blockchains are already testing this concept. TRON recently launched its algorithmic stablecoin, USDD. Djed, a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin for Cardano, developed by IOG and issued by COTI, went live in public testnet recently.

Sebastien Guillemot, dcSpart co-founder, tweeted that the company has been managing to focus on building its projects based on Cardano thanks to the aforementioned Treasury that currently contains three-quarters of a billion USD in ADA.

Hoskinson suggested buying some LUNA tokens for ""negative correlation,"" repeating a joke made by controversial Terraform Labs leader Do Kwon. 
 
A negative correlation indicates that one asset increases in value while the other decreases. Investors tend to include assets that are likely to move in the opposite direction for diversification purposes. In this way, it is possible to significantly reduce the level of risk. 
 
Kwon, who is known for his abrasive tweets, has seemingly been humbled by the market. The controversial crypto founder has been silent for almost a day after announcing that Terra was busy deploying more capital in order to shore up the embattled UST stablecoin.

With the price of the company's stock tumbling over 12% in the last few hours, the market  capitalization  of one of the biggest exchanges in the world is now beaten by projects like Cardano. According to CoinMarketCap,  Cardano  (ADA) total market capitalization is now sitting at approximately $20.8 billion as Coinbase's capitalization is now at $19 billion, while being close to almost $40 billion only a one week ago. Cardano is not the only cryptocurrency that is beating one of the biggest cryptocurrency trading platforms in the world, as XRP's $24 billion market capitalization also ‌exceeds Coinbase. According to the company's letter to investors, the first quarter of the new year inherited the trend of low cryptocurrency prices and high volatility directly from 2021. Because of increased risks on the market and worsening market conditions, more users had to leave the space for better times, which impacted the company's performance in Q1. High volatility on the cryptocurrency market and poor performance of most digital assets on the market caused a drop in the trading volume from $547 billion to $309 billion for the period. Coinbase added that current market conditions are temporary, and the company still believes in the cryptocurrency's  market  growth and the industry's further development. But despite the company's idealism, Coinbase's stock does not seem to reflect the same attitude of investors in both the middle and short-term perspective.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Explains How Djed's USD Peg Is Stronger Than UST's,"Charles Hoskinson , founder of IOHK and Cardano chain, has suggested an explanation to today's collapse of Terra's stablecoin, UST, and its native coin, LUNA. He has also claimed that Cardano-based stablecoin Djed is well protected from losing its dollar peg. Meanwhile, LUNA has managed to put up a fight. After falling below $1, the coin surged to the $5 zone but then again went down. At press time, it is trading at $2.14, down 92.4%. Hoskinson believes that LUNA's crash was the result of an attack that any DeFi protocol or cryptocurrency may face at any time. He stated that an attack like that could be pulled off by anyone from hackers to traders. A little exploit is enough to break it and succeed, Hosk tweeted. The rumors floating around about how Luna collapsed so quickly all converge to the same reality that every defi protocol and cryptocurrency face: There is a massive attack surface from hackers to traders. If there is an exploit, then someone will find it and break it. When asked by a Twitter user how the  Djed stablecoin  based on Cardano can avoid losing its USD peg, Hoskinson gave a short reply: ""Overcollateralization."" Djed is also an algorithmic stablecoin, like UST; however, its algorithm is based on a 400%-800% collateral ratio for Djed and Shen (Djed's reserve coin). Through this, Djed's collateralization mechanism is decentralized and supported by users who mint Shen and put ADA into the liquidity pool. Thus, the rate of collateralization remains more or less stable.

Terra's native asset, LUNA, has also declined nearly 93% as the incident fueled negative sentiment among Terra holders. Hoskinson had inquired into the progress of SigUSD, an algorithmic stablecoin based on the AgeUSD protocol. The AgeUSD protocol was researched in partnership among the Ergo Foundation, IOHK media and Emurgo, Cardano's commercial arm. In response to updates on SigUSD, the IOHK CEO then stated, ""protodjed is looking good."" SigmaUSD has proven the  $Djed  technology and its stability. This will bring new capital into the  #Cardano  ecosystem, benefitting every project. Stablecoins are vital for crypto markets because price stability is integrated into the assets themselves. This opens up various chances for DeFi and value transfer without the fear of price swings. The underlying collateral is how they attain price stability. Cardano's algorithmic stablecoin is named after Djed, which is the symbol of ''stability'' in ancient Egypt and the symbolic backbone of the god Osiris, the god of the afterlife and resurrection. Explaining the details on Djed, Cardano developer  Sooraj stated : ""Djed is the 1st stablecoin protocol for which stability claims are precisely & mathematically stated, proven & formally verified. Djed's governing algorithm behaves like an autonomous Bank that buys and sells stablecoins for a price in a range that is pegged to a target price.""

The first and biggest coin on the list of assets that remain profitable is Tron (TRX), which at press time shows around a 4% gain in the last 24 hours. The main fuel for Tron is the release of USDD stablecoin and constant buyouts on the  market . Previously, U.Today covered that Justin Sun, who is behind the Tron DAO, announced the purchase of 600 million TRX coins, which ‌allowed Tron to withhold the massive selling pressure across the cryptocurrency market. But since Terra's stablecoin has failed miserably, investors do not feel secure investing in an asset with a similar pegging mechanism. The token of the industry-leading Axie Infinity P2E game does not seem to care about the performance of other digital assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum as it gained almost 9% in the last 24 hours. Axie's performance looks even more impressive if we put it against Bitcoin or  Ethereum  pairs. As USD inflation is on the rise, stablecoins are losing trust, and Bitcoin has dropped by 20% in recent days and gold has gained more attention from investors as both inflation and volatility hedge, while almost every financial asset out there is heavily underperforming.

Yesterday, the worried community was finally presented with  Terra  co-founder Do Kwon’s recovery plan, which addresses the unmatched de-pegging of TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin. Kwon believes that there is no other way to stabilize the situation except for aggressively destroying the UST tokens that are leaving the market. Thus, he proposes to increase the ""minting capacity"" of the protocol from $293 million to $1.2 billion in equivalent; it will help to accelerate the process of token burning. Mudit Gupta, Polygon's chief information security officer, compared this collapse to the Lehman Brothers situation in 2008 that caused a financial crisis. According to Gupta, the crash of the second largest smart contracts platform will leave no crypto business unaffected. According to @DogeWhaleAlert Twitter account, over one-third of the overall circulating DOGE supply (30.90%) is currently kept by  Robinhood . This is worth an eye-popping $4,390,002,113 and constitutes 40,998,170,618 DOGE. The meme crypto that belongs to Robinhood's customers is held in the platform's two known wallets, 3334959 and 1699275, using eight addresses. Meanwhile, @DogeWhaleAlert has detected an anonymous address sending 359,324,741 coins worth $38,079,439 to a top 20 crypto wallet. The fee for this huge transaction was $6.71 (63.33 DOGE), a fee that no bank can offer. Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  provided a possible explanation for LUNA and UST’s collapse.

The top ten crypto assets' recovery in the past 24 hours. Source: Messari But the sharp ADA recovery does not promise an extended upward continuation, at least according to the three factors discussed below. Stock market crash far from over First, the price action in the Cardano and similar crypto-assets has  been in lockstep  with U.S. equities, especially tech stocks. Notably, the correlation coefficient between ADA and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite was 0.93 on May 13, meaning that any major moves in stocks would likely steer Cardano in the same direction.  The correlation between Cardano and Nasdaq Composite. Source: TradingView Moreover, the chances of Nasdaq undergoing a sharp recovery are currently slim, as analysts highlight the overstretched valuations of the Big Tech stocks and their probability of crashing further in a higher interest-rate environment. ""The [ax] is hanging, rather, over high-growth tech companies,""  opines  Richard Waters, the Financial Times' West Coast editor, adding:  ""This is where valuations became most stretched, and where the market is having the most trouble finding its nadir."" Simply put, Cardano's persistent positive  correlation with Nasdaq  could result in more sharp declines in the ADA market, at least for the time being. ADA's ""fifth wave missing"" Secondly, another hint of a potential  Cardano price decline  comes from a technical structure highlighted by Capo of Crypto, an independent market analyst. The pseudonymous analyst  notes  that ADA could fall to the $0.30–$0.35 range next, given its possibility to paint the fifth and final wave of a bearish Elliott Wave setup, as shown in the chart below.  ADA/USD two-day price chart featuring bearish Elliott Wave setup. Source: Capo of Crypto/TradingView The target range coincides with the support area from January 2021 that preceded a 850% bull run. Descending channel breakdown  Thirdly, Cardano has been breaking below its multi-month descending channel in another sign of weakness.   ADA has been trending lower inside a range defined by two falling, parallel trendlines, underscoring traders' current strategy of buying near the lower trendline and selling toward the upper trendline.  But on May 12, ADA/USD broke down below the lower trendline near $0.568, showing that traders ignored the buying opportunity. Instead, buyers showed up near the $0.378-level to  accumulate ADA , leading to the price rebound, as discussed above. However, the trading volume backing the recovery move was lower than during the selloffs, indicating a weakening rebound trend. ADA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Simultaneously, the upside retracement move showed signs of further weakness after testing the descending channel's bottom as resistance — a way of confirming the breakdown.

Djed, a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin for Cardano, developed by IOG and issued by COTI, was launched on the public testnet recently. Hoskinson noted this as a major milestone for algorithmic stablecoins. Explaining what gives Djed its stability, the COTI network writes in a recent  blogpost , ""Djed's algorithm is based on a collateral ratio in the range of 400%-800% for Djed and Shen."" If the reserve ratio is under 400%, the smart contract will prohibit minting any new Djed. In addition, Shen holders will not be able to burn their Shen at any time while the reserve ratio is below 400%. If the reserve ratio goes above 800%, the smart contract will prohibit minting any new Shen. Burning Shen is allowed and will decrease the reserve ratio. The reserve coin, Shen, is charged with the responsibility of providing extra reserves for the pool.

Tether, the biggest stablecoin used in cryptocurrency exchanges to facilitate trade, has recovered from a previous mini-drop, assuaging fears on the general cryptocurrency market. Tokens underpinning key DeFi protocols also recovered as several altcoins posted significant gains. Shiba Inu's recent listing on the Dubai exchange, Rain, has also contributed to the positive sentiment surrounding the meme cryptocurrency. Dogecoin  is also enjoying continued support from Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who again stated that the Bitcoin parody has the potential to become a currency in a recent tweet. Bitcoin rose above $30,000 on Friday despite significant concerns about stablecoin TerraUSD, which has sparked fear on the crypto market. According to  CoinMarketCap  data, the first and largest cryptocurrency was trading at roughly $30,268, up 9.07% in the last 24 hours after dropping to levels not seen since late 2020 earlier this week. On a weekly basis, though, the leading asset and the majority of altcoins were still trading lower. The crash of TerraUSD or UST stablecoin, which is intended to maintain parity with the U.S. dollar, has prompted the latest crypto meltdown that saw billions of dollars wiped off the market. The broader crypto market lost as much as 16% of its overall capitalization on Thursday alone, putting investors at risk. Earlier this week, Bitcoin and the rest of the market plummeted due to inflation fears and the potential of contagion from the fall of UST.

To keep you informed, U.Today has prepared the top four news stories from the past weekend. Elon Musk , head of Tesla and well-known Dogecoin supporter, seems to be reconsidering his purchase of Twitter, one of the biggest social media platforms in the world. In his recent statement, Musk said that bots or spammers may account for almost 90% of the platform's daily user base. Such statistics may cause significant reputational damage for Twitter, as well as bring issues with advertisers that use the platform to promote their services. The news made investors rapidly sell their Twitter stock, which caused a massive 10% drop on the market. Bitcoin’s price movement is sparking discussions all over the crypto industry, with many influencers offering their opinions on whether it will drop lower or surge to the moon.  Jack Dorsey , billionaire and prominent Bitcoin evangelist, has also shared his views on the matter while being rebuked by U.S. journalist Tom Philpott for not commenting on “Bitcoin burning.” Dorsey responded that he is not watching the BTC price as he is certain that the largest crypto will rise again in the long term. The reason for his confidence is the growing adoption of BTC as “more people are able to use it.” At the moment, Bitcoin is trading at $29,548, according to CoinMarketCap. On Sunday, two Ethereum killers,  Cardano and Solana , demonstrated the best performance among the top 10 cryptocurrencies, adding 11% and 14%, respectively. Avalanche, yet another competitor of Ethereum, has also spiked, increasing its value by 15%. However, the token remains down 32.56% due to extreme selling pressure caused by Avalanche’s affiliation with the Terra disaster. At the time of publication, SOL is down 2.67%, changing hands at $52.72, and ADA is up 0.44%, trading at $0.55, CoinMarketCap data shows. According to data shared by @shibburn, which tracks burn transactions and destroys  SHIB  itself from time to time, the Shiba community has sent a total of 948.6 million SHIB to dead-end wallets. However, this sum is not as impressive when converted to fiat - only $11,058 at the exchange rate at the time of burning.

In the December-March period, ADA had at least three attempts to break through the massive downtrend by entering a short-term 20-40% rally that should have become a catalyst of a retrace but failed to do so because of the massive selling pressure caused by the low  profitability  of the asset.

With the crash of  $UST  /  $LUNA , unsurprisingly, much doubt has been cast on  #algorithmic  stablecoins.  #Cardano  is launching its own  #stablecoin  as most of us know -  $DJED , which is already on testnet, but how is it different? ? With the majority of investors making their exit, UST's crash to near-zero levels was bound to happen. Cardano's stablecoin, Djed (DJED), which is currently in testnet, is backed by ADA, the core native asset of the Cardano (ADA) protocol. As such, it would be vulnerable to the same ""death spiral"" issues. However, to ensure its stability, an additional coin, SHEN, was integrated into its design. If there is not enough ADA to pay out to DJED holders, SHEN bonuses will come to the rescue. SHEN asset is also protected from inflation: When the reserve ratio hits 800%, SHEN minting stops. The mentioned design was already stress-tested by COTI Network and Input Output Global; even during periods of market volatility and ADA sell-offs, it kept a 1:1 peg to the USD equivalent. As covered by U.Today previously, the reconsideration of APR in Anchor Protocol (ANC) triggered the collapse of TerraUSD (UST) and Terra (LUNA) assets.

The study boiled down to highlighting five key points that define the crypto world. Some of the theses seem interesting, and some are obvious. But one of them clearly stands out. According to a16z's report, there are still no equal projects to Ethereum in the Web3 space, and those who can represent the real competition are still far behind. The thesis of the superiority of Ethereum, made by a16z analysts, is based on several metrics. One of them is the ratio of monthly active developers to days since the first commit. According to this indicator, about 4,000 developers are involved in the building of Ethereum. In second place is Solana, with 1,000 active developers. Cardano, for example, did not even make it into the top 500, as did the rest of the blockchains cited in the study. Other key parameters for blockchain popularity analysis are the number of active addresses and the number of daily transactions. In this case, Ethereum is behind Solana and BNB Chain and Polygon, with 5.5 million active addresses and 1.1 million daily transactions. Avalanche and Fantom also had the honor to be included in the table, but even there Cardano is many times inferior in numbers, having only 115,000 active addresses and about 125,000 daily transactions, according to  Messari . To summarize, despite its popularity, Ethereum gives in to the scale, placing more emphasis on decentralization. For this reason, other blockchains—Cardano among them—have been able to attract users with the promise of better performance and lower fees. And while Cardano is still in catch-up mode right now, it still has a small ray of hope for the future and a sizable number of followers.",https://u.today/venture-capital-giant-a16z-does-not-consider-cardano-competitor-of-ethereum,utoday,2022-05-17,15:20:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Pattern Predicted LUNA Crash, 3 Metrics Suggest BTC Has Strong Support, Hoskinson Offers Buterin to Come to Cardano: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","Check out the top four news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today. According to  Peter Brandt , chartists could have predicted LUNA’s collapse. A prominent cryptocurrency trader claims that the crash of Terra’s native asset was launched by the formation of the classic head and shoulders chart pattern. Despite the fact that traders sometimes ignore the significance of such classic patterns, Brandt believes that their predictive value was demonstrated during the notorious breakdown of the red-hot token. In the meantime, the UST/LUNA drama has drawn the financial watchdog’s attention to crypto regulation, with this subject being added to the agenda of the upcoming  G7 meeting  in Germany. Fidelity’s director of global macro, Jurrien Timmer, provided three metrics showing the current place of  Bitcoin  on the market and its potential for a reversal. First, the BTC to gold ratio stays on a major support after retracing from a local top. The ratio has successfully held through the selling pressure on both gold and BTC and is now merging. Second, the metric that determines whether Bitcoin is mainly held by ""weak"" or ""strong"" hands remains at its lowest point since the 2014 and 2018 bottoms, suggesting that older coins remain unspent and ""younger"" ones have been redistributed. Third, the metric tracking the number of ""old"" investors remains at 13% for more than a year, meaning that long-term holders are not even close to capitulating. Ethereum co-founder  Vitalik Buterin  has recently shared his inner struggles in a thread of tweets, thinking about contradictions in his thoughts and values. One such contradiction is between Buterin’s desire to see Ethereum become a more Bitcoin-like system and the realization that attaining this requires ""quite a lot of active, coordinated short-term changes."" In response to that, Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson (who is also a co-founder of Ethereum), tweeted that ""it's not too late to come to Cardano."" As of now, Buterin has not replied to the IOHK head’s invitation. Shiba Inu’s  daily charts show that the asset remains in support around the $0.0000117 to $0.0000119 level, holding above this level since May 15. The daily RSI is trending slightly upward above the oversold levels, indicating the probability of a near-term rally. Shiba Inu continues to trade in a triangle pattern with support near $0.0000087. Given the triangle pattern's impending constriction in the coming days, a huge move could be on the way. At press time, however, SHIB is trading down 4.55% at $0.00001177. Meanwhile, according to WhaleStats, Shiba Inu returned among the top 10 most purchased tokens by the 2,000 biggest ETH whales.",https://u.today/pattern-predicted-luna-crash-3-metrics-suggest-btc-has-strong-support-hoskinson-offers-buterin-to,utoday,2022-05-18,16:18:00,en

According to the official annoucement shared by the Input Output Global (IOG) developers - the engineers of Cardano's decentralized solutions - their new peer-to-peer networking instrument passed security checks. Shout out to the IOG networking team for a brilliant job on the new Peer-to-Peer (P2P) networking codebase. This is from our partners  @galois  who recently audited the code?  #Cardano   pic.twitter.com/OIlamQ1f4X As per screenshots shared on the new account, @IOG_Eng, on Twitter, the auditors - Galois, Inc. -  confirmed that the code is of a very high quality. They also highlighted that all necessary testing infrastructure (QuickChecks) is required for a safe, secure and attack-resistent developer experience. While reading and analyzing the code, the auditors unveiled zero bugs or potential vilnerabilities. As such, the system has no dangerous attack vectors. Cardano's (ADA) peer-to-peer networking testnet system went live in testnet in December 2021. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) is getting closer to its most crucial update in months, i.e., Vasil Hard Fork. Its testnet might be unveiled as soon as late May 2022. Vasil Hard Fork will go live with the implementation of four Cardano (ADA) improvement proposals or CIPS: CIP-31 (Reference Inputs), CIP-32 (Inline Datums), CIP-33 (Reference Scripts) and CIP-40 (Collateral Outputs).",https://u.today/cardano-devs-iog-shared-first-details-of-third-party-codebase-audit,utoday,2022-05-18,12:44:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Might Pull Off a 100% Recovery If This Pattern Plays Out Correctly: Details,"According to  CoinMarketCap  data, Cardano is down nearly 9% in the last 24 hours at $0.50. The bulls locally capitulated after an unsuccessful attempt to push the price above $0.613 on May 16. On the daily chart, the pullback from the Nov. 9, 2021, high of $2.38 and the recovery in late March followed by another round of declines resembles a  ""Cup and Handle""  pattern. #Cardano 
 
Cup and Handle….  pic.twitter.com/KIDqxDWY3B The ""Cup and Handle"" pattern is a bullish pattern that resembles a cup with a handle, where the cup is in the shape of a ""u"" and the handle has a slight downward drift. The consolidation period is captured within the handle, which is usually followed by a breakout. The target for the cup-and-handle formation is the height of the cup, plus the breakout point of the handle. For this pattern to gain strength, Cardano bulls might need to squash the horizontal barrier near the daily MA 50 at $0.85. Above that, another barrier is located at the daily MA 200 at $1.19. Rising above these constraints might imply a 100% rally for the eighth largest cryptocurrency, Cardano. Cardano recently found support for declines near the $0.39 level. Otherwise, if a retest of this level is necessitated in the coming days and the resilience of this support is confirmed, a new high might be attained soon.

cardano, News , Cardano accelerator program Genius X ISPO nets $105 million in ADA ,"Cardano-based accelerator program Genius X has seen more than $105 million worth of ADA delegated to its  initial stake pool offering  (ISPO). This comes after the firm’s decentralized automated market maker and liquidity management protocol  Genius Yield completed its ISPO  on May 10, with over 14,500 delegators staking 270 million Cardano ( ADA ) across four official stake pools, making it one of the biggest ISPOs within the Cardano ecosystem. Genius Yield is a Cardano-based decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that features a decentralized exchange with an order book. It integrates a liquidity provision model, which aims to mitigate market risk and eliminate impermanent loss. Genius X will serve as the accelerator program arm of the company, providing early-stage blockchain startups with relevant tools, consulting services and investment to build blockchain-based companies within the ecosystem. The Genius X ISPO has garnered significant support in the week following the ISPO launch on May 15. More than 205 million ADA ($105 million) has been delegated to four staking pools by nearly 14,000 participants. Genius X investors will receive GENSX for delegated ADA staked in the four staking pools of the accelerator’s ISPO — GENS1, GENS2, GENS3 and GENSX. Related:  3 reasons why Cardano can sink further despite ADA price bouncing 58% Dr. Sothy Kol-Men, the managing partner of Genius, believes the high interest in the ISPO is heartening given the last fortnight of events in the cryptocurrency space, dominated by the collapse of algorithmic stablecoin and DeFi platform Terra: ""This is an endorsement from our community and investors that we are on the right path, building and releasing the necessary foundation to accelerate growth, support ambitious projects planning to leverage Cardano's unique smart contracting architecture, and indeed, further promote adoption."" An ISPO is the Cardano ecosystem’s crowdfunding equivalent of an initial coin offering (ICO). ADA stakers delegate tokens to pools and exchange staking rewards for a project’s native token. An ISPO is non-custodial, meaning investors can reclaim their delegated ADA at any stage. The fundraising method has gained popularity given that investors continue to control their delegated funds to a given project, giving added peace of mind. The method contrasts a conventional ICO, in which investors part ways with a specific token to have a stake in a project or company.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-accelerator-program-genius-x-ispo-nets-105-million-in-ada,cointelegraph,2022-05-20,00:00:00,en

Also, 937 projects are being built on Cardano while the total number of NFT projects is increasing to 5,549. The rise in the number of minted pieces of non-fungible art and projects is linked to the Cardano network's growth. In April, NFT project Clay Nation launched its official collaboration with Snoop Dogg and Champ Medici, thus bringing iconic clay animations, land pitches and unlockable music content to Cardano. Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain that uses network validators to process transactions and maintain the network. It was founded in 2015 and launched in 2017 as an alternative to Ethereum. With a market capitalization of $18.22 billion at the time of writing, it is the eighth largest cryptocurrency. Cardano fell to lows of $0.39 in the past week as the crypto market experienced a sell-off. Cardano recovered, reaching a high of $0.613 on May 16. Cardano is presently consolidating while attempting a rebound. Cardano was presently trading at $0.535, up 4.28% in the last 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap data. The crypto asset remains down 5.79% since the past week. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson recently stated that cryptocurrencies might have entered a bear market when asked about the underperformance of the ADA coin. The Cardano founder admitted that no announcement would have an impact. As a result, the ADA price might continue to struggle despite the protocol's expanding technical capabilities and growing community.

This comes after a successful Fund8, with the winners already announced. The upcoming Project Catalyst Fund9 expects over 1,000 proposals to be submitted, with $16 million worth of ADA already earmarked for grants and ecosystem rewards. Project Catalyst is a collaborative effort between the Cardano community and Cardano's parent company, IOHK, to encourage Cardano network development. The community provides challenges across a range of Cardano-related projects during each funding round. The community then responds to these concerns by presenting plans that define concrete solutions. The community votes on the proposals and chooses which ones will be funded. In its weekly development updates, IOHK shared statistics regarding network growth on a chart. Currently, 943 projects are building on Cardano, up from 925 previously. A total of 85 projects have recently launched on Cardano, while the number of NFT projects has risen to 5,656. For the week, Github connects totaled 3,132, while  Cardano native  tokens stood at 4.8 million. Also, the number of Plutus scripts was 2,714. The  Vasil Hard Fork , scheduled for June 29, hopes to bring significant improvements to Cardano and its smart contract platform, Plutus. A suggested road map has been provided by IOHK ahead of the Vasil Hard Fork event.

cardano,No Section,"More Than 800,000 NFTs Minted on Cardano Since March as Number of Projects Increases","According to recent statistics  shared  by IOHK, the number of native assets issued on Cardano has risen to 4.8 million. On March 23, Morgan Schofield, head of ecosystem growth at Input Output HK, reported that Cardano's smart contracts platform hosts four million non-fungible tokens (NFTs), stating that ""the 4,000,000th Cardano NFT is being minted, with 50,000 distinct minting policies."" Charles Hoskinson , quoting this tweet, wrote, ""Remember when I predicted thousands of assets and DApps on Cardano? Well, I was wrong. There are now millions of native assets issued and DApps are now in the hundreds SlowAndSteady."" This difference suggests that since Morgan Schofield's tweet on March 23, more than 800,000  native assets  have been issued. The Cardano blockchain can natively generate, interact with, and delete custom tokens (or ""assets""). ""Native"" indicates that users can interact with these custom assets straight out of the box, without having to employ smart contracts. Cardano NFTs are the same as native assets from a technological standpoint. However, a native asset might be a Cardano NFT if it has other properties such as amount or value, name, and a unique policy ID. NFTs can be produced using the Cardano node and, thus, are native assets. However, unlike fungible native assets, which might consist of millions of interchangeable tokens, an NFT is a single native asset that cannot be reminted or destroyed, and it exists on the blockchain in perpetuity. In the past week, IOHK gave the total number of NFT projects on the Cardano network as 5,549. Presently, this number has risen to 5,656, representing an increase of 107 projects. The rise in the number of minted pieces of non-fungible art and projects is linked to the Cardano network's growth. As reported previously by  U.Today , Cardano NFT sales touched $27 million in April.

As Cardano blockchain explorer suggests, Milkomeda has processed through more than five million transactions since launch, or almost 100,000 transactions daily. Despite such a large flow of transactions, users are not facing any issues with transaction costs or network congestion. The average cost of a transaction is at $0.001 USD. In terms of security:

If they would do something ""dodgy"" - they are likely to receive bad publicity and loose delegators on L1. Currently, Milkomeda supports wrapped tokens via two bridges: Celer and Nomad. Traders can use stablecoins like USDT and USDC and cryptocurrencies like AVAX, BNB and ETH, besides a variety of  Ethereum-based tokens. In terms of security, the platform offers better and cheaper solutions compared to sidechains like BSC thanks to trusted operators on Cardano who run the network. As Insights Cardano suggests, any explicit activity by operators would cause an immediate loss of delegator spots on L1. Milkomeda plans on having 32 validators and may now offer a relatively high capacity of 500 to 1,000 transactions per second. Also, another sidechain or L3 solution would have no issues running whatsoever. In comparison,  Binance Smart Chain  has only 13 validators, which puts it behind Milkomeda. Milkomeda launched on Cardano network first with Solana support planned for the future.

Between May 19 and May 21, Cardano's DeFi witnessed inflows of nearly $73 million. This is reflected in the surge in total value locked (TVL) from roughly $124 million on May 19 to $197 million on May 21. Although this spike was short-lived, Cardano's TVL is facing an increase once again, as seen in the 24-hour change. Without the inclusion of staked governance tokens in TVL valuation, Cardano's TVL presently stands at about $137.87 million. However, with the inclusion of staking, its TVL is presently at $173.31 million. The majority of funds on the network are concentrated on the MinSwap decentralized platform, with $64.35 million currently locked. Second place is held by the recently launched Wingriders, with $34.08 million locked up. SundaeSwap currently has $32.56 million in total value locked in it.

cardano,No Section,This Is When Cardano Vasil Hard Fork Might Be Available on Testnet,"According to  glneto , a developer at Mutant NFTs, an NFT platform based on Cardano, the upcoming Vasil Hard Fork might be available on the public testnet by June 2, with the mainnet launch slated for June 29. The suggested road map provided earlier by Cardano's parent company,  IOHK , gives the end of May for the closed public testnet phase, and Vasil is expected to launch on the Cardano testnet in early June. Also, the mainnet hard fork proposal deadline has been set for June 29. Meanwhile, Cardano inventor Charles Hoskinson assures the community that the anticipated Vasil upgrade should take place as planned. The upcoming Vasil update will introduce four different CIPs: CIP-31 (Reference Inputs), CIP-32 (Inline Datums), CIP-33 (Reference Scripts) and CIP-40 (Collateral Outputs), as shared by IOHK. Reference inputs allow multiple dApps to be able to read from the same datum at the same time, thus improving concurrency. Multiple dApps can read from the same datum at the same time thanks to reference inputs, which improves concurrency. Inline data allows data to be saved on-chain instead of merely a hash, as Cardano does now. Developers can interact with the script more easily because they do not have to incorporate the data. On the other hand, the goal of reference scripts is to lower transaction costs. Currently, new scripts need to be included in each transaction. Scripts can be interacted with using reference scripts, which pushes them into the chain. As a result, smart contracts interaction is reduced to a bare minimum. Meanwhile, the purpose of collateral outputs is to improve the transaction validation process. The collateral set up for such instances is now forfeited if a transaction fails validation.

Take a closer look at the world of crypto! During his recent interview with CNBC Squawk Box in Davos, Guggenheim’s global chief investment officer,  Scott Minerd , shared that should Bitcoin break substantially below the $30,000 zone, the ultimate bottom for it would be $8,000. He also added that considering the current state of the market, the flagship crypto has a long way to fall. Even BTC’s technical factors being better than those of other cryptocurrencies does not help the situation, said Minerd. Per the Guggenheim CIO, there are no dominant players in crypto yet, and the right crypto prototype has not yet been created. Minerd then named three criteria a proper cryptocurrency should meet: be a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account, noting that most existing cryptos cannot meet even one of these. One of the  Cardano  community members has recently highlighted “a dishonorable mention” in a CNBC article. The article is devoted to European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde, who said that cryptocurrencies were worthless during the Dutch talk show ""College Tour"" on Sunday. One person from the show’s audience claimed they lost 7,000 euros ($7,469) after purchasing Cardano. Charles Hoskinson replied to it in a sarcastic manner, asking his followers if he should make a “Where’s Waldo?” version of ADA. The Cardano founder has already commented on ADA’s underperformance, indicating that cryptocurrencies may have entered a bear market. The Federal Reserve  conducted yet another annual survey to observe the economic health of the United States. For the first time, however, it included questions related to cryptocurrencies—Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. The results of the survey showed increasing interest in crypto among adults, with 12% of Americans holding crypto as an investment tool and 3% using it for payments. As per Pew Research Center, in November of last year, 16% of Americans (males between 18 and 29) admitted they had used crypto for trading, investing or payment. Bank of England Governor  Andrew Bailey  predicted that Bitcoin would not end up becoming a widely accepted form of payment since it is not “practical.” He argues that Bitcoin has value only because people want to own it. “People collect all sorts of things,” Bailey said. This is not the first time a high-profile central banker slams crypto. As reported by U.Today, Shaktikanta Das, the governor of the Reserve Bank of India, said that crypto has no underlying value,  echoing  Bailey’s comments.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Network Has 4 Times More Active Users Than Ethereum in Percentage Terms,"According to data by  Messar i on-chain and market tracker, the number of Cardano active users greatly exceeds Ethereum's in percentage terms. Such an imbalance could have been caused by a couple of  factors . The total number of Cardano wallets is currently at approximately 3.6 million, which is less than 5% of Ethereum's total number of opened wallets on the network. Such a sizeable difference in the number of wallets does not speak in favor of Cardano, making a percentage-based comparison less objective. Prior to the release of smart contracts on Cardano  blockchain , investors and users were treating ADA as a payment tool rather than a dApps platform, which is why its number of active wallets is close to Bitcoin's 2.2%, compared to Ethereum's 0.63%. With the rising number of decentralized solutions on the network, the percentage of active wallets compared to the total number of wallets is slowly decreasing. This effect is tied to the fact that developers and users ‌create many wallets for interacting with one decentralized app or testing it during the development process.

Good news for  SHIB holders  who love traveling: according to XcelTrip, a decentralized ticket and hotel booking platform, the canine coin can now be used for booking trips on their website, xceltrip.com. From this moment on, 2.3 million hotels, over 450 airlines and car rentals in more than 70 countries can be at Shiba Inu fans’ disposal. By introducing SHIB as a payment method, XcelTrip is now joining the ranks of luxury brands such as  Gucci  and Tag Heuer, which earlier in May announced the possibility of making purchases with the memecoin. However, the price of SHIB continues to steadily decline despite its mass acceptance as a means of payment. At the moment of writing, SHIB is changing hands at $0.0000105, down almost 5% over the past 24 hours. Earlier this week, a video featuring  Elon Musk’s  deepfake went viral on Twitter. The video  aimed to lure crypto holders into putting their money into a trading platform that offers “30% dividends every day for the rest of their life.” The Tesla boss rushed to comment on the phony promotion, stating that it was “definitely” not him. Luckily, most crypto users did not fall for the poor-quality video, taking issue with Musk’s voice, which sounds robotic and unintelligible. The viral video has not been left unnoticed by Dogecoin co-founder Billy Markus. He said that those who are stupid enough to fall for such a sham deserve to part ways with their money. The latest market picture demonstrated a few signals of a potential price surge of the  Ethereum  cryptocurrency. Santiment on-chain analytics platform reports that Ethereum's average fees are at extremely low levels (roughly $2.54 per transaction), adding that ETH tends to rise after average transactions dip below $5. The drop in gas prices was caused by the asset’s price sinking due to inflation fears and system risks within the broader crypto market. Also, the latest sell-off has pushed ETH price closer to the MA 200 at $1,179 on the weekly chart, which could serve as the lower support. According to market observers, a rebound could happen around here as major long-term buyers emerge. Iagon, a decentralized cloud computing platform,  has announced  that its Ethereum-Cardano token bridge goes live in beta version. According to the IAGON team, the token bridge was built to facilitate the conversion of ERC-20 IAG tokens to CNT IAG tokens, allowing tokens on different blockchains (Ethereum and Cardano) to interact.

I've learned so much these past 2 weeks while exploring  @cardano 
 
Here is my blog post which gives an overview of the Cardano tech, dapp ecosystem, and community 
 
I hope you all enjoy ? https://t.co/kW8JVVNrSj He admitted that he ended up spending two weeks on Cardano (ADA) research instead of the intended one week. In terms of technology, Mr. Valaitis is fascinated by the way Cardano takes after Bitcoin (BTC) in using the UTXO model and Nakamoto-style node consensus. Also, Cardano has ""relaxed"" its requirements for ADA staking: no slashing procedures or ADA locking periods have been introduced by the team. ADA tokens can be staked directly through dApps: as such, 70% of the aggregated ADA suppy is staked. Mr. Valaitis stresses that Cardano's launch was ""fair"" in terms of the ratio between public and insider allocations: this paved the way for more inclusive token distribution. With the release of Milkomeda EVM sidechain, Cardano (ADA) will be fully Ethereum-compatible: developers will be able to move their dApps from Ethereum to Cardano. Also, Cardano is still in the top five in terms of development activity. Flagship Cardano (ADA) DeFis SundaeSwap and Minswap have UX/UI on par with the top popular decentralized crypto exchanges in the segment. The breakout of Cardano's NFT ecosystem is yet to come: I expect Cardano NFTs to experience breakout growth in the coming quarters as more of Cardano’s passionate community moves their funds into these collections. Cardano's large and passionate community is ""the secret sauce"" behind the progress of this blockchain. In general, Mr. Valaitis is optimistic about Cardano (ADA) and claims that ""everyone in the space should dive into [Cardano] at some point.""",https://u.today/ethereum-defi-advisor-reviewed-cardano-ada-results,utoday,2022-05-27,12:59:00,en

Satoshi Nakamoto, the enigmatic Bitcoin creator, believes that scarcity may create value; hence, the maximum supply of Bitcoin was limited to 21 million coins. The 19 millionth Bitcoin was mined in April, leaving only two million BTC to be mined in about 100 years. Cardano, like Bitcoin but unlike Ethereum, has a finite supply limit, with only 45 billion ADA ever to be created over the coin's existence. Presently, 33.82 billion ADA are in circulation, accounting for 75% of the maximum supply, and 34.27 billion ADA have been created so far, per CoinMarketCap data. However, because of continued unfavorable market conditions, the ""ADA whale"" believes that now may not be the time to load up on ADA.

Explaining how the Vasil Hard Fork might contribute to an influx of lending apps, Cardano Blockchain Insights wrote: ""After the Vasil hard fork, if dApp developers start using CIP-33 and users batch transactions, we can expect at least a minimum (conservatively) x10 of this value at ca. 40 PPS but more like 250 PPS. This should allow a wide range of applications (e.g. lending dApps) to finally go live."" Overall, the goal of reference scripts (CIP-33) is to lower transaction costs. Currently, new scripts need to be included in each transaction. Scripts can be interacted with using reference scripts, which pushes them onto the chain. As a result, smart contracts interaction is reduced to a bare minimum. The upcoming Vasil Hard Fork might be available on the public testnet in early June, with the mainnet launch slated for June 29.

On Friday, May 27, the Twitter account of Travis Johnson's  SHIB  burn games announced that SHIB Super Store, a regular canine coin burner, has been added to the Amazon affiliate program. From now on, the shop intends to use from 1 to 20% of profits from it to buy SHIB, which will be burned every Sunday. At the moment, the total amount of tokens burned by the project stands at 2,036,128,785 SHIB. To reach such an impressive result, SHIB Super Store used part of its income from advertising in games, selling SHIB-branded merch and a SHIB-themed YouTube channel. John Deaton, founder of CryptoLaw, is concerned about  Elon Musk  frequently promoting Dogecoin on his Twitter account. Thus, Deaton decided to warn the Tesla boss about the potential danger of such activity, noting that it may get him in the same legal trouble as Ripple and XRP token. It all started with Twitter user @JayBlessed901 complaining about the unfairness of the SEC’s long-lasting suit against Ripple, while Musk freely drives the DOGE price up with his tweets. The complaint caught the lawyer’s attention as he suggested that the SEC might sue the centibillionaire for that. According to Deaton, Gensler and the SEC may identify Dogecoin as an investment contract with Musk and his companies. Terra , a collapse-surviving project, announced reaching a new milestone: producing Block 1 of the brand new Terra blockchain. Now, holders eligible for the LUNA airdrop can view their wallet balances on the new chain. On its official Twitter account, the team behind the project wrote that the event marks “the next chapter for the Terra community,” in which Terra’s potential knows no bounds. However, the project’s optimism is not shared by everyone. Billionaire investor  Mark Cuban  criticized the new Terra blockchain ahead of its launch, with Dogecoin’s Billy Markus and BitGo CEO Mike Belshe doubting Terra’s future success. Hartmann Capital’s Felix Hartmann, on the other hand, believed that the new initiative is worth watching, but it will also require a lot of grinding on the part of the founders because they will no longer have billion-dollar market valuations.

The profitability of the ADA shorting strategy just dropped to an extreme level. The amplitude downtrend on Cardano was potentially broken after the price of the asset spiked by around 40%. Such a strong price performance caused around $300 million in liquidations, which is a massive volume for a single  coin . We have previously seen signs of a reversal on  Cardano , as the downtrend slowed down progressively with RSI entering the oversold zone. On May 28, ADA's reversal began, with the coin's upward volatility increasing. Unfortunately, a 40% price spike is not enough to pull out ADA from the strong downtrend in which it remained for the last 270 days. Cardano's break through the price of $0.75 would be one of the first signs of a trend reversal. Another signal suggesting that a reversal is around is the divergence between the Relative Strength Index and the price chart. The indicator suggests that ‌we will see a short- or mid-term reversal in the upcoming weeks.

But ADA/USD failed to extend its rally further upward and dropped by almost 13.75% from its weekly high. ADA price: Ear market vibes Cardano's price retreated sharply on June 1, giving up a portion of the gains secured in the previous two days. The question now arises whether the ADA/USD pair can extend its recovery trend, especially as it  trades almost 80% below  its September 2021 peak of $3.16. Interestingly, the downside retracement began  after ADA tested its 50-day exponential moving average  (50-day EMA; the red wave in the chart below) as resistance. Also, the pair moved lower in tandem with a broader correction sentiment across riskier assets, including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the S&P 500 (SPX). ADA/USD daily price chart.

The activity of developers on the network is near record-breaking, and here's what users can  expect  this summer. One of the biggest updates on Cardano will bring reference scripts, inline datums and reference inputs.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Here are 3 altcoins that could surge once Bitcoin flips $35K to support ,"Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the wider cryptocurrency market are taking a breather after the rally on May 31. Meanwhile, most altcoins remain severely oversold, with most between 70% and 90% below their all-time highs.  Total altcoin index capitalization What is clear is that fear is everywhere and blood is in the water. Risk-on markets are suffering  worldwide, but it is exactly these kinds of conditions that create opportunities where professional money accumulates and adds to positions.  Let’s take a look at three altcoins that could be positioned for a rebound if the broader market enters a new uptrend. ADA could be setting up for an 80% surge Cardano ( ADA ) has a significantly bullish update coming very soon. The much anticipated Vasil hard fork, which increases performance and adds more Plutus enhancements, is planned for June.  From a price action perspective, ADA is positioned in a strong price range that will likely support any further upside that the broader market experienced. Within the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system, ADA has maintained a significant gap between the bodies of the past three weekly candlesticks and the Tenkan-Sen.  When the bodies of the candlesticks and the Tenkan-Sen have noticeable gaps, a correction often occurs within three to four days. This is because the equilibrium is out of sync, the Tenkan-Sen and price action like to stick together as much as possible. A mean reversion back to the Tenkan-sen is extremely likely when one strays too far from the other.  ADA/USD weekly Ichimoku Kinko Hyo chart Source: TradingView However, if the broader cryptocurrency market experiences a big bounce,  ADA  price may shoot past the Tenkan-Sen to test the Kijun-Sen. ADA has not tested the weekly Kijun-Sen since the week of November 8, 2021.  The weekly Kijun-Sen is at $1.02 and contains the 2021 volume point of control and the 50% Fibonacci retracement of the all-time high to the low of January 25, 2021. ADA/USD weekly chart (Binance) Source: TradingView Related:  Bitcoin may hit $14K in 2022, but buying BTC now ‘as good as it gets:’ Analyst MATIC aims for $1 Looking at the weekly chart of Polygon ( MATIC ), one can’t help but notice that it looks strikingly similar to ADA. MATIC and ADA both have sold off from $3 and both are stuck in the mid $0.50 to mid $0.60 price range, but that is where the similarities mostly end.  Fundamentally, MATIC remains strong. Governments worldwide have attempted to restrict or ban mining due to excessive energy costs for proof-of-work blockchains and MATIC is likely to avoid government scrutiny and attract supporters as a positive example of environmental stewardship. Polygon (MATIC) Source: Twitter Like ADA, MATIC has significant gaps between the bodies of its weekly candlesticks and the Tenkan-Sen. Although, MATIC’s gaps are more significant. Likewise, the gap between price and the Kijun-Sen is much more meaningful.  Within the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo system, there is a max-mean that price will travel away from the Kijun-Sen before experiencing a violent mean reversion. For MATIC, that threshold is 63%.  MATIC/USD weekly chart (Binance) Source: TradingView Any renewed bullish momentum ifor  Bitcoin  will likely see MATIC lead the altcoins higher until it reaches the $1.00 to $1.15 value area near the weekly Tenkan-Sen.  XLM lags the altcoin market, but it’s known for surprises Sometimes it is hard to forget that during the last major bull run from the COVID crash to November 2021, there were a few major  altcoins  that did not hit new all-time highs. Stellar ( XLM ) is one. In fact, the last time XLM made a new all-time high was the week of January 8, 2018, almost four and a half years ago! One thing that XLM has going for it that not many other weekly charts have is a very clear falling wedge pattern. Out of the standard rectangle and triangle patterns in technical analysis, wedge patterns are the most powerful. What makes its wedge so powerful is the probable fakeout breakout lower. XLM/USD weekly chart (Binance) Source: TradingView The most probable direction for a falling wedge is higher — but breakouts below a falling wedge can yield powerful short opportunities. The typical behavior that analysts and traders expect to see with a failed falling wedge is an immediate and swift sell-off, but so far, bears have been unable or unwilling to do so.  Instead, the weekly chart for XLM shows a very strong probability of a fakeout. If bullish momentum returns to the cryptocurrency market, XLM is likely to hit the second peak of the falling wedge near the $0.38 value area.  Classic technical analysts believe that technicals lead fundamentals. If that is true, then altcoins like XLM, MATIC, and ADA could be positioned in very desirable conditions in the event of any new bull run.  However, downside risks remain a concern, but they are likely extremely limited. If a new uptrend fails to materialize before the end of June, the cryptocurrency market will probably move sideways until a major breakout higher or lower occurs in the Fall.

The purpose of reference scripts (CIP-33) is to reduce transaction costs in general. At the moment, each transaction requires the inclusion of new scripts. Reference scripts can be used to interact with scripts, which pushes them into the chain. As a result, interaction between smart contracts is minimized as much as possible. According to a recent report from Cardano's parent firm,  IOHK , the closed Vasil testnet has already been deployed to assess its functionality with a small group of dApps and users.

As the Beacon chain validator rating suggests, Lido Finance, Coinbase and Kraken penetrate around 55% of the network. The majority of ETH 2.0 validators are ‌exchanges or custodians, which directly affect the decentralization of the network. Alternatively, networks like Cardano offer more diversity, as the chain's top SPOs are community members. The metric, which measures the network's opportunity to withstand the 51% attack, called the ""Minimum Attack Vector,"" is on a significantly higher level for Cardano than for Ethereum: 23 and 3, respectively. Previously, users started to actively question Ethereum's intentions to remain decentralized in the future as the co-founder of the network, Vitalik Buterin, suggested centralized block production with decentralized validation. In addition to Proposer-Builder Separation, Buterin has recently described the concept of  ""soulbound tokens""  as an alternative to NFTs. SBF tokens would be issued by a centralized entity and will not be transferable as an alternative to the type of items presented in MMORPGs like World of Warcraft.

Cardano is developed in Haskell for both its off-chain and on-chain codes. Haskell, on the other hand, is not one of the most widely used programming languages. Cardano , on the other hand, chose Haskell because it believes Cardano's Plutus and Marlowe smart contracts can be carefully implemented in a precise, formally verified language that provides a high level of certainty from the start.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Shows Upward Spike Potential After Moving in Massive Falling Wedge,"The relatively weak price performance on Cardano may end soon as the cryptocurrency is coming closer to a breakout from the nine-month-old chart pattern that will most likely fuel a volatility spike. According to the asset's daily chart, Cardano still remains in a long-term downtrend since September 2021, when ADA reached the current all-time high of $3.1 after the announcement of smart contracts technology. Unfortunately, ADA missed the rally on the cryptocurrency market back in November and struggled to show any kind of positive price performance. With the gradually decreasing volatility of ADA, we saw the formation of a massive long-term falling wedge pattern, which might become a foundation of a global trend reversal for Cardano. At press time, Cardano is moving closer to the narrow part of the pattern, which indicates that we will most likely see a breakout in either direction quite soon. Unfortunately, there is no proper way of determining the direction of a breakout since it is affected by a variety of independent factors. The most recent rally on Cardano was fueled by the fundamental growth of the network, which attracted millions of users' funds after the release of the first decentralized applications. Because of the outflow of funds from the DeFi industry, Cardano-based applications lost a major part of their TVL, causing a slight crisis in the ecosystem. But despite that fact, Cardano developers are getting ready for a summer rich with new decentralized solutions and application releases.

The crypto community had hardly forgotten about Solana’s outage that took place  last week  before another halting bore down. The Solana Mainnet Beta struggled with the issue for about four and a half hours and, later, validators managed to restart the main network. According to Anatoly Yakovenko, Solana Labs’ co-founder, there was a bug that made nodes generate different outputs, which led to a consensus failure and eventually shut down the network. Cardano creator  Charles Hoskinson  rushed to comment on the incident, suggesting to Solana’ developers a video about how to fix old video games. Hoskinson later explained that the reason for his sarcastic remark was that the Solana community has mercilessly mocked Cardano for trying to do things right and use expert judgment and formal methods to avoid such problems. According to the 30-day Market Value to Realized Value (MVRV),  Shiba Inu  might be nearing the ""opportunity"" zone amid present accumulation. The 30-day MVRV for SHIB fell below the previous two local bottoms at -34% and -44%, which, per Santiment, suggests that short-term holders are losing money and are less likely to sell. At the moment of writing, SHIB is trading at $0.0000106, down 3.5% over the last 24 hours. In the case of a further downturn, a break below the lower end of the range at $0.00001047 might risk a retest of the $0.00000856 level. If history repeats, SHIB might consolidate for a while before the next move.

However, despite the Golden State recently becoming more crypto friendly, it is obvious that Dogecoin has little to no chance of getting adopted as legal tender in California since Ursich is likely to get a miniscule number of votes. As previously  reported by U.Today , California is one of the top states in terms of Bitcoin mining despite its ambition to reach carbon neutrality by 2045. The state accounts for 7.5% of the country's hashrate. Bloomberg Law reports that  Bitcoin's  energy needs have come under the Biden administration’s scrutiny as it is now working on policy recommendations on crypto mining. The White House’s principal assistant director for energy Dr. Costa Samaras says that it is critical to reduce total emissions if Bitcoin becomes a ""meaningful"" component of the financial system. Yet, there are few details about the administration's approach to crypto mining regulation, and it is unclear whether any policy will be implemented. As  reported by U.Today , in March, President Biden signed an executive order on cryptocurrencies. The decision was applauded by the cryptocurrency community as it was seen as being generally favorable of the industry, particularly miners.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-trolls-solana-shib-suggests-key-trend-doge-as-legal-tender-in-california-crypto,utoday,2022-06-03,16:27:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Users to Explore Djed Stablecoin Trial on EVM Sidechain: Details,"Per a recent announcement by the  Milkomeda  team, Cardano users might soon be able to test Djed stablecoin on the Milkomeda testnet. The team said it was going to make available a testnet version of Djed on Milkomeda testnet, thus allowing users to explore the algorithmic stablecoin. Milkomeda is an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible sidechain, letting developers achieve cross-chain interoperability between Cardano and Ethereum. Curious about the upcoming Djed stablecoin? 
 
Would you like to learn more, play with it in a safe way (testnet with no real value). We will make available a testnet version of Djed on Milkomeda Testnet. 
 
Coming up next week!  pic.twitter.com/JGXUS7CjSX The Milkomeda Foundation announced the release of C1, an Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible sidechain that is directly connected to the Cardano blockchain, in late March. This allows assets to be transferred between the two blockchains, allowing popular Ethereum-based decentralized apps (dApps) to be run on top of Cardano using wrapped smart contract technology. Djed, a crypto-backed algorithmic stablecoin that operates as an autonomous bank, was launched on testnet on May 4. Djed is an over-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin developed by Cardano's IOG and issued by COTI. It employs SHEN as a reserve coin and is backed by ADA. To ensure that there is enough ADA in the pool, Djed's algorithm uses a collateral ratio of 400-800% for Djed and SHEN. This indicates that there is $3-7 worth of ADA in the reserve pool for every 1 Djed minted. The 400-800% ratio is thought to provide a sufficient buffer to absorb ADA's volatility. The reserve coin, SHEN, compensates for ADA price swings by covering deficits and ensuring the collateralization rate. Users must interact with a smart contract by sending ADA to its address to mint the Djed stablecoin. The Djed will then be returned to the user via the smart contract. In a  blog post , the COTI team describes how Djed differs from UST: ""Although DJED and UST are both algorithmic stablecoins, only DJED is over-collateralized (up to 8X), which reduces its chance of getting depegged, while averting a death spiral by blocking coin burning and minting.""",https://u.today/cardano-users-to-explore-djed-stablecoin-trial-on-evm-sidechain-details,utoday,2022-06-04,17:00:00,en

As stated in the report, the next major milestone is the introduction of a new node for the Vasil upgrade, as well as the first release of the new CLI, which will contain the new Plutus capabilities. IOHK says the plan next week is to spin up a new Vasil developer testnet and collaborate closely with an extended group of developers and ecosystem partners on final testing to ensure ecosystem partners (including developers and third-party component providers) have the time they need before hard forking the main Cardano testnet. IOHK also provided a chart with network growth information. Currently, 992 projects are building on Cardano, up from 986 previously.

He has again mentioned “ghost transactions”. CTO of Input Output Hong Kong, Romain Pellerin, has tweeted that in 2022 network transaction volume for Cardano has surpassed that of Bitcoin, Ethereum, DOT, ALGO and Dogecoin. ADA volume of transactions has been up 369 percent this year, while BTC has dropped 15 percent, Ethereum lost 49 percent and Dogecoin is down 79 percent. Commenting on that, Charles Hoskinson again mentioned “ghost transactions” and “”SpookyAlpha” in particular. This is thanks to our new ghost generator that has dramatically increased ghost transactions.

Earlier, Hoskinson  posted a tweet mocking  the recent network halt. The mainnet outage lasted slightly over four hours. Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko took to Twitter to explain the situation, saying that part of the network considered the block in question invalid, thus the whole Solana network was brought to a temporary halt. Hoskinson addressed the situation by tweeting a link to a YouTube video for Solana devs about how to fix an old video game. Later on, Hosk admitted that Cardano has been getting a lot of criticism from both Solana and Terra recently and so he could not stay away from trolling the former. As for Terra, its coins Luna and UST have witnessed a drastic collapse in price recently. Do Kwon decided to conduct a hardfork, leaving the old coin behind as Luna Classic and giving the name LUNA to a new one. As for the criticism of Solana co-founders regarding Cardano, on Friday, U.Today reported that  Anatoly Yakovenko stated  at a podcast recently that Cardano developers are “trying to build a cathedral”, doing it too carefully and too slowly, while they just have to “kiss a frog” and “ship something”.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-trolls-critics-saying-ada-transactions-have-dramatically-risen-due-to-spookyalpha,utoday,2022-06-04,08:55:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Faces Institutional Inflows as Investors Pull Funds from Ethereum and Bitcoin to ADA,"Cardano is seeing inflows of funds from  institutional investors  as the demand for the network is on the rise following many upcoming releases and solutions, putting the ecosystem in one category with giants like Ethereum, per  CoinShares . The most interesting part of the report is not the existence of rising inflows, but the rate of reallocation of institutional funds. Ethereum and Solana are being actively drained as ADA gains more confidence among institutions. At the current pace, in the next few months, the volume of  ADA  held by institutions will exceed  Ethereum  holdings. The most likely cause of the outflow of funds from Ethereum is recent issues with Beacon chain that are possible on the mainnet after the Merge. Security concerns could become a massive issue for investors, especially institutions that tend to choose stable investments over speculative ones. The block reorganization may have caused a replication of all transactions and operations on the main network that have happened while it was present. Previously, U.Today covered the massive growth of the network, as Cardano recorded a 368% YTD increase in daily on-chain transactions. Such a strong increase is tied to the release of the first decentralized applications and solutions built on the ecosystem. The biggest and most awaited update for Cardano is Vasil Hard Fork that will bring several CIPs to life. Expected network upgrades will decrease transaction fees and processing time, making Cardano one of the cheapest and fastest networks in the industry.

In recent times, Cardano's IOHK announced increases in Plutus script memory as Cardano sought to tackle scaling difficulties faced in attaining the throughput required to support real-world applications. I'm an optimist. Ppl told me last year “H1 2022 before Vasil will be disastrous for Cardano bc of throughput issues, after that it’s sunshine & rainbows” and I was like nah, H1 will give us dapp after dapp, issues under the hood will frustrate but won’t slow momentum & good vibes Improvements in memory and CPU parameters for Plutus, however, remain one of 11 ways that Cardano intends to scale in 2022. Other paths include block size increases, pipelining, input endorsers, node enhancements, on-disk storage, sidechains, the Layer 2 Hydra scaling solution, offloading computation and the Mithril solution. According to a  blog post , IOHK earlier stated that it intends to group multiple code releases that include key elements of its scaling plan, such as pipelining, new Plutus CIPs and UTXO on-disk storage, and Hydra in the Vasil June and October hard forks. These features, when combined with the parameter adjustments, aim to boost Cardano's throughput and optimize the system to support a growing number of decentralized finance (DeFi) apps, smart contracts and DEXs. At the moment, six dApps are currently contributing to Cardano's TVL of $129.96 million, per  DefiLlama  data. The number of dApps may not, however, be a cause for concern as TRON, presently the third largest DeFi platform, has seven dApps contributing to its $6 billion TVL.

The  Shiba Inu  cryptocurrency can pride itself on two major milestones reached last week. First, according to the Shibburn data, the burn rate of the Dogecoin rival increased by 189.16% on Thursday, June 2. At that time, Shiba Inu supporters destroyed a total of 141,010,050 tokens, which took merely six transactions. The second milestone concerns the number of SHIB holders. According to another blockchain data platform, WhaleStats, the SHIB holder count has demonstrated growth to 1,198,132 holders. However, in this regard, Shiba Inu trails another meme coin,  BabyDoge , which counts 1.5 million holders. Veteran trader  Peter Brandt  has responded to a prediction by Cheds, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader and analyst, which states that Bitcoin could plunge to as low as $12,000. If that is the case, Brandt said, it would be the first time a correction goes below the previous all-time high, and the fourth correction of up to 80% since 2011. While Bitcoin is struggling to return to the $40,000 zone, crypto experts and influencers continue dropping bearish prediction bombs. Last month, Guggenheim Chief Investment Officer Scott Minerd forecasted that the BTC price could end up falling to as low as $8,000. Bloomberg’s Mike McGlone sees the Fed’s hiking of interest rates as the main headwind for Bitcoin. At the moment, the flagship crypto is down 56.92% from the record high of $69,044 that was achieved seven months ago. Ethereum founder  Vitalik Buterin  asked the community what they disagree with him the most about in a recent tweet. The post has quickly gained attention among ETH enthusiasts, scoring more than 4,000 likes and 1,700 retweets. It was not long before the most reputable members in the community shared their opinions. Ethereum co-founder Anthony Sassano believes that it was a mistake to give Dogecoin legitimacy. Angel investor Mariano Conti disagrees with Buterin’s idea of extending the human lifespan. Hudson Jameson, a software engineer who joined the Ethereum Foundation back in 2016, believes that Buterin’s avoidance of political topics was a mistake since everything is becoming politicized. The asset has performed poorly so far in 2022, but the much-anticipated upgrade might provide a much-needed positive boost.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Is Cardano ready for a go at $1? June's hard fork FOMO lifts ADA price to weekly highs ,"Cardano ( ADA ) was among the best performers among the  top cryptocurrencies on June 6  as traders assessed a key upgrade that promises to enhance its blockchain's smart contract capabilities. Vasil hard fork FOMO Dubbed "" Vasil,"" the so-called hard fork event  will tentatively take place on June 29, 2022. As a result of the euphoria surrounding this upgrade, traders have started speculating more on ADA's upside prospects, resulting in its better performance than other top-ranking digital assets. For instance, ADA's price rose by over 14% to $0.64 on June 6 compared to the 6% gains of its top rival, Ether ( ETH ), on the same day. Thanks to the excitement surrounding its upcoming Vasil Hard Fork,  #ADA  surged over 20% to become one of the best-performing cryptos last week.

 Cardano's price history also shows similar euphoric behaviors among traders in the days leading up to hard fork events. For example, the "" Alonzo"" upgrade in September 2021 , which introduced smart contract functionalities to the Cardano network, preceded a 200%-plus ADA price rally, as shown below. ADA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Similarly, Cardano's "" Mary "" hard fork in March 2021 preceded ADA's 1,600%-plus price boom. ADA bull traps The previous price rallies that led to the hard fork events also occurred  amid an expansionary macro-environment . At the time, interest rates were near-zero, and the Federal Reserve was buying $120 billion worth of government bonds every month. But currently, the  U.S. central bank has turned hawkish  after witnessing persistently higher inflation. Therefore, many analysts argue that there is now less U.S. dollar liquidity to buy riskier assets, including stocks and cryptos. Cardano has  reeled under the pressure of the Fed's tightening , with ADA trading almost 80% lower than its September 2021 peak of $3.16. The broader move downside also includes significant bounces, as shown in the chart below. ADA/USD daily price chart featuring price rebounds in ongoing bear market. Source: TradingView ADA price to $1? From the technical perspective, ADA now tests a resistance confluence comprising a falling trendline and its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave) near $0.66 and a horizontal trendline (the neckline) near $0.62 that constitutes what appears to be a ""double bottom"" pattern. ADA/USD daily price chart featuring 'double bottom' setup. Source: TradingView A break above the resistance confluence could trigger the double bottom breakout. Related:  Crypto funds under management drop to a low not seen since July 2021 As a rule of technical analysis, traders measure the double bottom's breakout target by adding the distance between the bottom levels and the neckline to the breakout point. That paints a June target of  $0.87, up around 40% from June 's price and likely ahead of the Vasil upgrade. A follow-up rally could also see ADA testing its 200-day exponential moving average (200-day EMA; the blue wave) near $1 for a breakout or pullback. A pullback seems more likely, however, given the prevailing macro risks.

Previously, U.Today covered the rising inflows of institutional funds into the network. While inflows to  BTC  and ETH slowed down significantly, ADA saw a spike in investment volume. The rising institutional interest is most likely tied to the fundamental growth of the ecosystem and the relatively cheap price of the representing asset.

Partnership will not only make it possible to utilize Djed as a trading pair with other coins available on MuesliSwap but also to provide liquidity through a stablecoin's trading pools on a decentralized exchange and thereby allow users to receive returns on their crypto assets. Given the incredibly large range of Cardano-based tokens on MuesliSwap, Djed integration seems like a logical step and another brick in building a holistic ecosystem, where the user will have all the necessary tools available within one environment and will not be looking for solutions at competitors' sites. At the same time, it is worth being careful, keeping in mind the recent  Terra  story, where users were also able to operate with a native LUNA token and UST stablecoin within one framework. In the end, they lost everything.

It did not age well.  According to the year-old report, XRP and Cardano should have lost their places in the top 10 of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. The analysts' main argument was the share of the market and usage that Cardano and XRP used to have. With networks like Binance Smart Chain growing exponentially and pushing older coins back, Arcane was betting on the growth of blockchain with high usability and revenue, which Cardano and XRP lacked. The situation changed when Cardano introduced smart contracts technology and the first  decentralized applications  built on the network started to attract users and investors. At a certain point, the network celebrated more than $300 million locked in a smart contract of decentralized applications. As for now, Cardano sees a mild outflow of funds following the overall crisis in the DeFi and NFT fields, but it still remains in the top six of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, according to CoinMarketCap, including various stablecoins. Among nonstable cryptocurrencies, ADA remains the fourth biggest digital asset in the world. Besides improving their place on the market, Cardano is getting ready for a variety of updates and announcements in the summer, including the Vasil Hard Fork that will bring many CIPs to life and various solutions like the Djed algorithmic stablecoin.

To resuscitate the token for an uptrend, buyers might have to push the price above the $0.0000146 barrier, or the price might return to its current consolidation range. Shiba Inu also faces buying pressure from whales as it is back in the top 10 most-purchased tokens among the 500 biggest ETH whales. This has caused the average Shiba Inu balance and the value held by whales to drop. At the moment, the top 500 ETH whales are holding $544,698,614 worth of SHIB. FXStreet, citing anonymous SEC staffers, revealed that  Terra’s Do Kwon  moved $80 million worth of LUNA and UST to his wallets and cashed them out before these two coins crashed. The embattled project and its founder are currently being investigated by the U.S. SEC as they suspect Kwon of money laundering. The regulator found out that more than $80 million worth of LUNA (now LUNC) and UST were moved from the company's funds monthly and sent to various wallets, which seemingly belonged to Do Kown, to cover operational expenses. An unnamed high-ranked Terra employee states that Kwon did not receive any official payments from Terra.

Bitcoin outflows were $57 million last week, bringing month-to-date outflows to $91 million. Ethereum recorded another week of outflows at $41 million, bringing total year-to-date outflows to $387 million. In anticipation of aggressive monetary policy, digital asset investment product flows have remained choppy. Cardano and XRP, however, received minor positive inflows in comparison to the huge outflows seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum. Larger-than-anticipated inflation numbers are adding to the negative sentiment on crypto markets, and the U.S. Federal Reserve is poised to raise interest rates this week to curb growing costs. In the past week, U.S. stocks sold off heavily, with the Nasdaq dropping sharply into a bear market. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies have a history of being linked to equities and other risky assets. Cryptocurrencies dipped to their lowest levels in 2022, owing to a massive sell-off of risk assets. Furthermore, the crypto lending platform Celsius halted withdrawals for its customers, raising concerns about contagion on the broader markets.

The crypto giant has roughly 5,000 full-time employees, which means that its workforce will now shrink by roughly 18%. The cryptocurrency industry is currently in the middle of a brutal bear market. CEO Brian Armstrong, who bought a $133 million Bel Air mansion in January, has admitted that the company's extremely fast growth was not sustainable, and the exchange now has to adjust its business to a new environment. Armstrong is expecting the U.S. economy to enter a recession, which may trigger a long-lasting crypto winter. He adds that the exchange hired too many people during the bull market. That said, the Coinbase COO stressed that the company's financial position was strong enough to ""power through"" any crypto winter.

This is good news for the SHIB community, since Shibarium will bring investors the opportunity to make huge profits. Shytoshi posted his announcement on the Welly's Discord server, adding that discussions about moving into a more active pre-release phase have already begun. In May, Kusama also wrote on his Medium blog that the release of Shibarium will be accompanied with the launch of the Shibarium Hackathon. The hackathon will primarily have an educational purpose and educate the community about all the features of Shibarium. Jurrien Timmer , director of global macro at Fidelity, pointed out two technical and market indicators that signify that Bitcoin has reached the bottom. The first one is the descending channel in which Bitcoin was moving since reaching the all-time high in November. The first test of the channel’s lower border happened back in January, when Bitcoin hit $31,000. As for now, Bitcoin hit the support at around $22,000, making a mid-term bounce possible from a technical standpoint. The second indicator is the ABC waves count, or Elliott Wave Theory, which suggests that the market moves in certain wavelike patterns. It is ""cold comfort"" for bullish Bitcoin holders, according to the expert, who claims that macroeconomics ""couldn't be any worse"" right now, given the Fed's hawkishness, ""surprisingly"" strong inflation figures, and a massive sell-off on financial markets. Negative sentiment  continues to prevail on the cryptocurrency market. Data provided by Coinshares demonstrates negative outflows of $102 million in the past week, with Bitcoin recording outflows of $57 million, and Ethereum $41 million. Unlike the two largest cryptocurrencies, Cardano and XRP received minor positive inflows. The assets’ prices, however, experienced all of the struggles of the market downturn: Cardano dropped as much as 20% to touch lows of $0.435 before rebounding strongly.

The bill, however, is unlikely to pass this year since it would have to be approved by several relevant committees before the Senate will be able to hold a full vote on the legislation.

According to Saylor, since that time, Bitcoin has performed 10 times better than any other asset, mentioning the S&P 500, gold and the Nasdaq 100 index. He also stated that BTC is a risk-off store of value asset for a long-time-frame investment, adding that “nobody has ever lost money investing in Bitcoin for four years.” Saylor believes that, for Bitcoin, the $21,685 level is a simple moving average for a period of four years. BTC has only touched this level a few times in its history, and it has done it now.

Ripple  has released a three-page response to the SEC's submission of proposed redactions to the SEC's letter opposing Movants' motion to file an amicus brief regarding one of the SEC's experts. Ripple defendants had no objections to the SEC's decision to seal several exhibits in their entirety, including those containing identifying information about the expert. However, the company feels that the SEC “has not satisfied the standards in sealing off the documents.” Additionally, ""the SEC has requested redactions of passages that demonstrate the weakness of the expert's analysis."" These passages do not pose any safety risk but seem to target information that would reflect weakness in the SEC's case. In the meantime, the XRP community continues to keep its fingers crossed regarding the Hinman email issue. Cardano’s  flagship play-to-earn product, Cardalonia, unlocks new passive income opportunities for its enthusiasts. Cardalonia (LONIA) launched a crypto staking vault, which allows its clients to not only enjoy periodic rewards, but it also unlocks the premium perks of the Cardalonia ecosystem. LONIA stakers can get access to limited presale land tickets, governance in Cardalonia’s DAO and compounded monthly rewards. Per the Cardalonia team’s estimations, users can enjoy up to 20-25% in annualized yield on their LONIA stakes. Cardalonia also shared the details of its updated roadmap for Q3-Q4, 2022.

In his recent tweet, Schiff wrote that Bitcoin and Ethereum had come very close to the levels that he predicted for them earlier—$20,000 for BTC and $1,000 for ETH. The Bitcoin critic admitted, however, that he did not hit the bullseye, as Bitcoin was $80 away from the predicted $20,000 level, and Ethereum was $20 away from $1,000. Schiff believes the two largest cryptos have not reached the bottom yet, adding that their real crash will happen when coins reach the $20,000 and $1,000 levels and leave them behind.

Aside from positive expectations surrounding the upcoming Vasil hard fork, ADA Whale cites other reasons, such as ""on/off chains, faulty staking mechanisms, VC dumps and overleveraged chaos elsewhere behind."" Some of the pump  $ADA  has seen last weeks (vs ETH, BTC, alts) is probably because of the Vasil hard fork, but starting to think a not insignificant part of it is also people leaving the on/off chains, faulty staking mechanisms, VC dumps and overleveraged chaos elsewhere behind According to reports, Three Arrows Capital, or 3AC, a leading hedge fund in the space, is apparently nearing insolvency after $400 million in liquidations. Has anyone started a list of who’s directly affected? 
 
I’ve received DMs from multiple people/teams who lent them money, but I’m not gonna share any names before they give consent. Blockchain analytics firm  Nansen  says 3AC's lenders continue to come forward as the fund, which handled $10 billion in assets in March, failed to fulfill margin calls and so liquidated its cryptocurrency holdings. Celsius, the embattled cryptocurrency lending platform, announced on Monday that it was suspending all withdrawals, adding to the market's already-stressed state. Concerns about the firm's solvency have been raised since the value of its assets has dropped by more than half since October. In the same timeframe, CEL token has lost 97% of its value.

The cryptocurrency firm was hit hard by the collapse of Terra, one of the biggest blockchain projects that completely imploded in early May. According to co-founder Kyle Davis, who has finally spoken out about the hedge fund's financial woes, 3AC's $200 million position in the Luna token evaporated after the prices of the governance token and its sister stablecoin, TerraUSD, crashed to virtually zero. 
 
While 3AC was able to weather the initial hit from the Tether contagion, it then went belly-up due to falling cryptocurrency prices. Earlier this week, the price of Bitcoin crashed to as low as $20,000, its lowest level since December 2020. The hedge fund is currently in the process of valuing some of its illiquid assets, Davis says. Davies founded 3AC together with his classmate Zhu Su all the way back in 2012. The two ended up becoming one of the world's biggest crypto holders, with 3AC managing billions of dollars. After rumors about 3AC's problems started circulating earlier this June, Zhu seemingly confirmed them with a vague tweet about working with ""relevant parties."" The hedge fund had been mum about its troubles until now, refusing requests for comment.

In multi-sig systems, transactions need to be approved by the majority of participants. What is Mithril  @IOHK_Charles  always mentions?

Long answer: Read more to learn wtf these words are #cardano   $ada   #crypto   #IOGresearch 
👇1/9  pic.twitter.com/29WEXDgASG In some multi-sig designs, the limit is even higher: the crypto segment knows 6/7 and 7/8 multi-sig wallets. Mithril multi-sig architecture advances this procedure: it allows users to consider the number of ADA staked by signers to weight their roles in approval processes. This solution, proposed by Input Output Global's lead developers Pyrros Chaidos and Aggelos Kiayias, makes multi-sig designs fairer and more inclusive: To a sign a message, m possible signers are randomly selected based on their stake. If k out of m sign, a full signature is obtained (...) The parameters for this are very important, as you wouldn't want just 3 holders ""representing"" the entire network. Mithril design would be relevant for numerous use cases in Web3. Mr. Schmiedel is certain it can be useful for approval of blockchain checkpoints and even a Voltaire-era upgrade. Mithril's efficiency is guaranteed by its logarithmic complexity and sophisticated software design. As covered by U.Today previously, in Q2, 2022, the growth of Cardano's ecosystem accelerated: it onboarded over 1,000 applications from various spheres. Mostly, these applications are from the NFT segment; collections of digital tokens and the marketplace are responsible for almost 50% of all dApps.

cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Responds to Question About His “Claiming to Be Satoshi”, Here's What He Says","Crypto YouTuber Alexander Lorenzo has announced that he is negotiating an interview with creator of  Cardano  and a co-founder of Ethereum network Charles Hoskinson and offered his followers to suggest questions to be asked to Hoskinson. Twitter user chaddydill.eth asked what he believed to be an uncomfortable question both for Lorenzo and for Hoskinson. Charles responded right in that thread, cutting the anonymous Twitter down to size. The anonymous Twitter user asked why Hoskinson claimed to be Satoshi back in the early 2010s, while he was working on Ethereum together with Vitalik Buterin, Joe Lubin and other ETH co-founders. Hosk chose to respond this immediately without waiting to be asked during the potential interview. He advised the curious person not to believe everything he reads on the Internet or in books about the history of crypto and denied ever claiming to be the BTC creator. In particular, Hosk mentioned that back in 2009, when the mysterious  Satoshi Nakamoto  released Bitcoin, he was only 20 years old. I can answer that here. I didn't and it's stupid to even claim it. I was 20 years old when bitcoin was released. Not everything you read in a book is true. I know it might be a shock On Friday, June 17, the founder of IOG and Cardano tweeted that he had received  an official invitation from the US Committee  on Agriculture to talk about blockchain and cryptocurrencies. The Committee on Agriculture was created in 1820 to regulate commodities which were mainly things grown like wheat, corn, etc. After 1974, when the CFTC was launched, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission started overseeing the commodity futures trade. Hence now, crypto future trading is also regulated by the CFTC which is linked to the aforementioned Agriculture Committee. Bitcoin and Ethereum have been officially considered commodities for a few years now. Hoskinson’s speech will take place on June 23 next week and will be broadcast live on YouTube so that everyone who is interested can watch it.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-responds-to-question-about-his-claiming-to-be-satoshi-heres-what-he-says,utoday,2022-06-18,09:17:00,en
cardano,No Section,Peter Brandt Predicts Ether May Collapse to $300 ,"In a  recent tweet , trading legend  Peter Brandt  predicts that the price of Ether, the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, could plunge to as low as $300. To underscore his extreme bearishness, Brandt said that he wouldn’t be buying the leading altcoin with his enemy’s money. 
 
On Saturday, the cryptocurrency collapsed to as low as $881 on the Binance exchange, its lowest level since December 2020. 
 
After a modest relief rally, ETH is now changing hands at $989 on Binance, but overall sentiment remains overwhelmingly bearish. 
 
Ether is now down nearly 80% from its record peak of $4,878 that was achieved back in November. 
 
The chief altcoin would have to decline another 69% from here in order to reach Brandt’s bearish price target.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Massively Outperforms Bitcoin and Ethereum as It Avoids Market Sell-Off,"While the majority of the top-tier assets on the cryptocurrency  market  are struggling under unseen selling pressure, projects like Cardano are feeling relief as they avoid a massive plunge down and even show significant growth in assets like Ethereum and  Bitcoin . Unexpectedly, Cardano easily beat top-tier digital assets like XRP, ETH and BTC, thanks to the lack of leveraged positions open on the market and lower institutional exposure, as they appeared to be two main reasons behind the strong plunge of the market. Both neutral performance on the ADA/USD pair and a plunge below $900 for Ethereum is fueling the 75% gain. The strongest plunge on Ethereum since 2020 helps with ADA's short-term rally against major players on the market. While  Ethereum's  massive sell-off is the biggest support for ADA, Bitcoin's 32% drop in value caused only a 25% return for Cardano, which does not make it the best hedge against the cryptocurrency market but still a better option than holding large caps like BTC or ETH. While ADA's growth is mostly tied to the lack of exposure to institutional funds that are being liquidated, industry experts are also highlighting the fundamental wellness of the network, which is receiving a massive amount of updates and releases this summer, including Djed stablecoin, Vasil hard fork and others. With the constant updates and relatively low pressure from investors because of the low-leveraged nature of the asset, Cardano has all the chances of being among the leaders when the cryptocurrency market sees new funds inflows.

As per mid month, we’re very close now but ultimately need to assess readiness of Dapps, exchanges, SPOs etc. We’ll have an update for everyone Monday According to rumors circulating the internet, major issues have been detected in the Cardano Vasil Hard Fork, which could delay the release back to August. IOHK just held its mid-month update where it claimed that everything was progressing as planned. According to the source, stake pool operators (SPOs) need to switch to the latest upgrade for the Vasil Hard Fork to be a success—but with only two weeks until the planned launch, meeting deadlines is looking more unlikely. Tim Harrison, on the other hand, stated that the community will be updated on the progress of Vasil HFC on Monday, June 20. While the community awaits the expected update on Monday, it might be necessary to have a throwback to previous updates shared by  IOHK  as regards the Vasil Hard Fork. 👍Today we’re delighted to report we’ve successfully delivered a new Node release for  #Vasil  with the first release of our new CLI, inc. new  #Plutus  capabilities. Alongside we continue to address the remaining issues we’ve caught in our extensive ongoing testing program. 
6/n 🧵 On June 7, IOHK announced in a thread of tweets that it was in the final mile of the Vasil HFC event and that work was going smoothly. The integration program for Vasil is the most challenging to date from a variety of perspectives since it is a process that necessitates not only tremendous effort but also close coordination. The core node, multiple components and the DB-Sync to third-party APIs like Blockfrost must be upgraded, and thus many interdependencies. IOHK also announced a new Vasil node version, a CLI release, and a new developer testnet created to ensure that its ecosystem partners have enough time. It further added that its focus has now shifted to measuring weekly milestones that should determine the next steps.

According to the builders'  assurances , the new wallet will offer users the ability to store, control and manage their cryptocurrency assets, including NFTs, in one place, without the need to resort to any other solutions. The Lace wallet's  features and characteristics also include its interoperability and the ability to use different blockchain ecosystems, not only Cardano itself. This mechanism was achieved with the help of sidechain solutions from Input Output Global. Initially, developers focused their efforts on establishing interoperability between the Cardano and Ethereum networks. Right now, the innovation is in test mode. As soon as the testing is over, the builders promise to start implementing other sidechains and connecting all other blockchains. The ultimate goal, according to the press release, is to turn Lace into a full-fledged ""one-stop shop"" wallet. The Input Output team also paid  special  attention to the wallet's design. According to the authors, Lace was designed in such a way that it would be equally easy to understand for both a newcomer and a seasoned user. Free of crypto world jargon and filled with lots of tutorials, Lace, according to Input Ouput, should be able to open up the power of the web3 space to everyone. This mission should be aided by a free decentralized app store, which will have facilities both for developers and regular users. End users will also be able to access the limitless world of dApps on Cardano, an alternative to the iOS and Android apps that carry the corporate burden of centralization. Commenting on the release,  Charles Hoskinson , head of Input Ouput and a well-known crypto entrepreneur, said that the world does not need another light wallet.

Let’s dive deeper into the details with U.Today’s top four news stories. The  SHIB community  celebrates another milestone reached by its beloved canine coin. The number of Twitter followers of Shiba Inu's official account hit an eye-popping 3.4 million, adding more than 700,000 followers since February. Thus, Shiba Inu caught up with its rival meme crypto, Dogecoin, that also has about 3.4 million Twitter followers. In addition to that, Shiba Inu's holder count continues to grow. According to WhaleStats, the total number of SHIB holders has risen to 1,182,817, suggesting long-term interest in the asset. Another win that SHIB achieved last week was  flipping FTT  in the biggest holdings for the top 100 ETH whales, pushing it to fourth place. Crypto YouTuber Alexander Lorenzo offered to  Charles Hoskinson’s  followers to suggest questions to be asked of the Cardano creator during his potential interview. One of them, asked by an anonymous Twitter user, concerned Hoskinson’s alleged claims to be mysterious Bitcoin developer Satoshi Nakamoto. Without waiting for the interview to happen, Charles rushed to respond to the allegations, advising the user not to believe everything he or she reads on the Internet or in books about the history of crypto. He also denied ever claiming to be the BTC creator, adding that when Bitcoin was released back in 2009, he was only 20 years old. Meanwhile, Hoskinson might take part in the new music video by  Snoop Dogg  and his son. On Friday, Champ Medici tweeted that they would love to have the IOHK CEO on their project, to which Hosk responded, “let’s figure it out.” Kraken , one of the top cryptocurrency exchanges in the U.S. based in San Francisco, has announced that it is expanding its support for Dogecoin and will list its future contracts. The futures contract derives its value from the underlying cryptocurrency, Dogecoin in this case, and allows one to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency without actual ownership. Trading is set to begin today, June 20. Kraken is also set to offer futures contracts for Tron's TRX and Fantom's FTM.

According to the updated schedule, Input Output is intending to hard fork the testnet at the end of June. After that, cryptocurrency exchanges and stake pool operators will have roughly a month for testing the new upgrade. Roughly 80% of trading platforms have to be compliant before the hard fork will be able to launch on the mainnet.  Input Output has stressed that no timeline can be “absolute.”  The hard fork, which was named after Bulgarian mathematician Vasil Dabov, has been the most complex program of development to date, according to Hemsley. It is expected to dramatically improve the network’s scalability, thus boosting its adoption.  The postponement hasn’t affected the Cardano (ADA) price.

cardano, News , ‘Disappointing:’ Cardano devs delay Vasil hard fork by a month ,"Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the blockchain engineering firm behind the Cardano network, has released some “disappointing news,” announcing a one-month delay to the long-awaited Vasil upgrade.  The Vasil upgrade is set to provide a “massive performance improvement to Cardano” and its smart contract capabilities, according to  Cardano co-founder Charles Hoskinson . It was  previously slated to go through on June 29 . However, the latest estimate is now set for the last week of July.  IOHK’s head of delivery and project Nigel Hemsley noted in a Monday blog post that the core Input Output Global (IOG) team working on the upgrade “is extremely close to finalizing the core work” but there are still seven bugs that remain outstanding and require work. None of them are categorized as “severe,” he added. “The work on Vasil has been the most complex program of development and integration to date, from several angles. It’s a challenging process that requires not only significant work from core teams, but also close coordination across the ecosystem,” Hemsley wrote. As a result, the Cardano Foundation — the non-profit that oversees the development of Cardano — and the IOG team agreed to defer sending the Vasil hard fork to the Cardano testnet from June 20 until June 29.  Once the testnet has been hard forked, devs from Cardanao-based  decentralized applications (DApps)  and stake pool operators SPOs will have roughly four weeks “to carry out any required integration and testing work” before the Vasil hard fork is initiated on the mainnet in late July:  “This is only reasonable and should not be rushed. The working assumption should therefore now be a Cardano mainnet hard fork occurring during the last week of July.” “We recognize that this news will be disappointing to some. However, we are taking an abundance of caution to ensure that we do this deployment correctly,” Hemsley added.  The Vasil hard fork is the biggest upgrade to Cardano since the  Alonzo hard fork in September , which finally enabled smart contracts on the network. This latest upgrade is set to introduce four network improvements dubbed “CIP31, CIP32, CIP33, and CIP40.” Related:  Price analysis 6/20: BTC, ETH, BNB, ADA, XRP, SOL, DOGE, DOT, LEO, AVAX In theory, these upgrades are designed to reduce the size of transactions, therefore increasing the network’s throughput and lowering transaction fees on the network.

Per CoinMarketCap, yesterday  Shiba Inu  demonstrated one of the biggest and strongest retraces on the market as it spiked more than 15%. Thus, the canine coin appeared in sixth place as the most rapidly growing asset, surpassing such cryptocurrencies as Ethereum and Cardano. This strong growth could be explained by the attractiveness of assets with relatively low capitalization and liquidity, as they tend to give greater returns during short-term market bounces. In addition to this, SHIB is getting support from constant burning events like the most recent Amazon-powered burn of approximately  70 million meme tokens . Despite a relatively low USD value of burned tokens, the SHIB burning event still attracts a lot of attention from retail traders and investors. According to the  BabyDoge  tracker account @babydogeburn_, on Tuesday, June 21, nearly 3 quadrillion Baby Doge Coins have been burned within merely one hour. This has been done as part of the plan to destroy 50 quadrillion BabyDoge. Even though the sum might seem impressive, the amount of the annihilated tokens is worth only $4,056, according to BabyDoge coin’s exchange rate at the time. The initial supply of BabyDoge totaled 420 quadrillion, but after recent Burns, it has been reduced twice down to about 232 quadrillion canine tokens. BabyDoge coin is currently changing hands at $0.000000001397. Input Output, lead Cardano developer, has announced that the launch of the  Vasil Hard Fork  has been postponed to late July.

In his recent interview with The Guardian, Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao  said it may take a few months or years for Bitcoin to reach its all-time high of nearly $70,000. He also stated that the $20,000 level is not actually that low, highlighting his point by saying that if people in 2018 or 2019 were told that the king crypto would trade at $20K, they would be “very happy.” According to Ian Harnett, the co-founder of Absolute Strategy Research, previous crypto rallies indicate that Bitcoin tends to decline roughly 80% from all-time highs. Such a repeat in 2022 might drag the lead cryptocurrency down nearly 40% to $13,000—a ""key support area.” Binance  has once again shown its support for the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency. One of the three tokens of the Shiba Inu ecosystem, ShibaSwap’s BONE now has its price trackable on Binance, one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges in the world. The news of the introduction of this innovation has ignited another wave of rumors about the possible listing of BONE on the exchange. However, it remains unknown if BONE will eventually be added by Binance. To be listed on the platform, a token must be extremely popular and in demand, capable of stirring up the crowd and causing wild price movement. At the moment, BONE is only fully listed on the MEXC exchange.

Earlier today  @IOHK_Charles  appeared before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture, Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit. 
 
Here's his testimony on the future of digital asset regulation https://t.co/v4PqKcsgrk First, the founder of Cardano provided background information on  Input-Output (IOG) , ongoing initiatives, research and the company's ongoing efforts in Africa. He continued by giving examples of how blockchain technology is being used to address issues in the real world, such as those confronting the beef industry. According to Hoskinson, there are several applications for blockchain technology, including enhancing the industry's end-to-end supply chain and traceability. The IOG CEO also gives an indication of the immense economic growth and development that blockchain technology could bring to America, particularly in rural areas, by citing many IOHK projects and collaborations. The developer of Cardano remarked that for the American blockchain industry to thrive and realize its full potential, it may take the combined efforts of several agencies and the private sector. Charles Hoskinson then discussed how working with the blockchain industry toward a principles-based approach that takes advantage of the nation's amazing capacities for innovation might help Congress accomplish significant outcomes on regulation. He opines that it is crucial to recognize that category-based regulation, which is restricted to a specific jurisdiction's borders and solely relies on centralized actors for reporting and disclosure, is unlikely to be effective in a blockchain-based decentralized ecosystem and will stifle innovation. He points out that principles-based legislation is more adaptable and more likely to change along with emerging technologies without stifling a sector that has just begun or is driving businesses abroad. Hoskinson continued that he remains in favor of appropriate and responsible regulation of digital assets and blockchain technology. However, he notes that given the novelty of the technology and the radical novelty of the asset class, it cannot easily fit within the parameters of the laws and tests established almost a century ago.",https://u.today/cardanos-iohk-shares-recap-of-charles-hoskinsons-testimony-heres-what-was-said,utoday,2022-06-24,13:29:00,en

As reported by U.Today, Solana developers have disabled the durable nonce transaction feature to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again. On Thursday, Solana  announced  the release of the ""Saga,"" an Android phone with features that are closely integrated with Solana, at an event in New York.

cardano,No Section,Ripple Overtakes Cardano in Market Cap Top: CoinMarketCap,"Despite a suspicious lull in the crypto market,  CoinMarketCap's  top by market capitalization remains the site of a heated battle for top spots between Ripple (XRP) and Cardano (ADA). Back in late May, Cardano was overtaking Ripple by $2.3 billion in capitalization and ranked sixth in the top. Then, in a period of general panic and growing capitulation, both projects lost their places, giving in to stablecoins. Now, as of June 24, one of them has managed not only to get ahead of its competitor, but also to reach a new height. So, Ripple climbed to sixth place at the top with $18 billion in capitalization, leaving Cardano  behind by a billion dollars . What is funny is that at the very end of May, both companies had several billion more in capitalization, and the current position Ripple is taking is primarily due to today's  impressive 13% increase  in the price of XRP, which is twice the price of Cardano (ADA). Well, at least there is growth, and thanks for that. The battle between Cardano and Ripple is definitely not over. Both projects are waiting for a breakthrough in their way and have a couple of aces up their sleeves that, given the right circumstances, will help them not only consolidate their sixth-eighth places at the top, but possibly go further and take the sweet fifth place of Binance Coin (BNB), which embodies the power of one of the largest crypto exchanges in the world and a very popular blockchain network, BNB Beacon Chain. As things stand, Ripple fans and builders are eagerly monitoring the ongoing case of the U.S. SEC against the company, which, according to the latest news, seems to be  nearing completion . Cardano, on the other hand, is actively working on the  Vasil Hard Fork  event, which should take the blockchain to the next stage of evolution.

He got a response from economist and trader Alex Kruger, who named a likely reason for this reverse. Kruger has shared what he believes to be the cause of the current bullish reverse in the crypto and stock prices – the recent “subtle, yet impressive” change of the Fed’s policy from hawkish to dovish. When Markus asked him to elaborate, Kruger tagged his earlier tweets about that. On July 17, Kruger tweeted about it, stating that the upcoming week would be good for risk assets, which include Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Back on that day, chairman of the US Fed Reserve Jerome Powell announced the new goal of the Fed to return to the 2 percent inflation level, reducing it from the present record high of 40 years. This came after the US central bank first raised the key interest rate by 25 basis points March, 50 basis points in May and then recently by 75 points in June in an attempt to harness the rapidly rising inflation. Clear reason: Fed pivot Over the past two days, the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, along with the majority of other coins on the crypto market. The flagship crypto BTC has surged, adding 7.63 percent and is now trading at $21,398. The second largest crypto has gone up nearly 18 percent, rising from $1,048 to the $1,1233 level. As of this writing, however, Ethereum is changing hands at $1,226. While prior to this rise many were talking about a new crypto winter that might last about 3-4 years, regular crypto critics have been predicting Bitcoin’s further collapse to the $10,000 level and lower, among them is goldbug Peter Schiff, founder of SchiffGold wealth management fund. Another famous Bitcoin opponent, expert trader and philosopher, author of “Black Swan”, “Antifragile” and other books Nassim Taleb, according to his recent tweet, believe that the term “crypto winter” cannot be applied to the near future of the digital assets market as it assumes a temporary seasonal state.

As previously reported, IOG agreed on a new target date to hard fork the testnet at the end of June. Exchanges and SPOs should have four weeks to accomplish all necessary testing and integration tasks before the mainnet fork. This places a tentative end-of-July date for the Vasil mainnet hard fork. According to information provided in its weekly report, the IOG team has tagged a new node, v.1.35.0-rc4. This version of the node might be used for the Cardano testnet hard fork.

Ark Invest outlined its three revolutions around cryptocurrencies in its ""Big Ideas"" report that was published earlier this year. 
 
The Florida-based investment management firm believes that Bitcoin and Ether represent a ""money revolution"" by creating the world's first private digital monetary system. 
 
Meanwhile, decentralized finance (DeFi) is leading the financial services revolution. 
 
""We are impressed at how robust the ecosystem has been,"" Wood said. 
 
One of Wall Street's most famous stock pickers says that her team expected the collapse of Terra to cause a severe chain reaction, but the Ethereum blockchain has held up ""very well."" In the aforementioned report, the Ark team predicted that the market cap of Ethereum could experience a 50-fold increase over the next decade.

When  $ADA  spikes again,  #FOMO  should return quickly.  https://t.co/u3oD2XkFGI   pic.twitter.com/wz3XWR9gtC In a recent tweet, analytics firm Santiment wrote, ""On this bear market slide, Cardano is seeing the least amount of unique addresses interacting on its network in a year. On top of this, sentiment on social platforms has fallen to a 4-month low. When ADA spikes again, FOMO should return quickly."" This may seem positive for ADA prices, as negative sentiment suggests a higher likelihood of price bottoms. Positive sentiment, on the other hand, presents a higher chance of price tops. ADA experienced lackluster price action in February as its price steadily fell to a temporary bottom at $0.74, from which point it then consolidated. Its social sentiment changed for the worse due to underwhelming trading. A month later, at the beginning of April, Cardano rose to its high of $1.24. Cardano may, therefore, soon find a price bottom from which it may creep higher if history is any guide. The $0.52 and $0.92 levels, however, continue to be obstacles for bulls to overcome.

Hoskinson  called  eUTxO, whose beta version was released on June 25, a ""really cool project"" that deserves funding from Catalyst, an inner Cardano accelerator that supports tech start-ups and projects built or centered on blockchain. eUTxO was built on a volunteer basis by Cardano community member and developer Peter Oraveс.

So, according to analytics from  Santiment , Cardano's address activity has sunk to year-low levels, with overall sentiment back to negativity levels last seen four months ago, in February. Analyzing the given data, we can see how the number of active addresses on the Cardano network has dropped multiple times compared to its local peak in January 2022. During the first month of the year, the number of active addresses increased by 130%, from 125,000 to 286,000 addresses. Nevertheless, subsequently the number of active Cardano addresses decreased relentlessly. By the end of June, there are only 64,000 active  Cardano  addresses, which is more than four times lower than the January highs. Such a dramatic decrease in the number of active addresses is worrying because it is an important indicator for determining the number of users on the blockchain, taking into account both senders and receivers of assets. Thus, we can say that activity on the Cardano network is very much in decline, and fewer and fewer people are using the blockchain and its products. At this rate, the eUTxO explorer will be unnecessary, because there will simply be nothing to explore.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-embraces-new-blockchain-explorer-ada-network-activity-continues-to-fall,utoday,2022-06-28,11:33:00,en
cardano, Altcoin Watch , Can Cardano's July hard fork prevent ADA price from plunging 60%?  ,"Cardano ( ADA ) has started painting a bearish continuation pattern on its longer-timeframe charts, raising its likelihood of undergoing a major price crash by August. ADA price in danger of a 60% plunge Dubbed the ""bear pennant ,"" the pattern forms when the price consolidates inside a range defined by a falling trendline resistance and rising trendline support after a strong move downside. Additionally, the consolidation moves accompany a decrease in trading volumes.  Bear pennants typically resolve after the price breaks below their trendline support and, as a rule, could fall by as much as the height of the previous big downtrend, called a ""flagpole,"" as illustrated in the chart below.  ADA/USD three-day price chart featuring ""bear pennant'""setup. Source: TradingView As a result, a decisive breakdown below ADA's bear pennant structure could mean extended declines to the level at length equal to the flagpole. In other words, the  target for Cardano's price  will be $0.20, down over 60% from June 28's price. In the meantime, ADA shows signs of consolidating inside the pennant's range with its imminent bias looking skewed toward bulls. This opens the door for ADA/USD to rebound from the pennant's rising trendline support near $0.46 to rally toward its falling trendline resistance around $0.60 by July.  Cardano's Vasil hard fork Despite the interim bearish outlook, Cardano could get a boost from its  upcoming ""Vasil"" hard fork . The upgrade, originally  scheduled for June end , will now go live sometime in July and aims to improve the Cardano network's speed and scalability.  Related:  Institutional crypto asset products saw record weekly outflows of $423M In addition, Vasil is expected to make Cardano more developer-friendly, which proponents argue could even attract projects from  rivaling layer-one blockchains , leading to a higher demand for ADA. ADA's price  has a history  of rising in the days leading up to Cardano hard forks, which should boost its chances at a rally alongside favorable technicals, as shown below. ADA/USD three-day price chart featuring 'bear pennant' setup. Source: TradingView What's more, ADA also has a  history of plunging hard  after its  hard forks in a sell-the-news fashion .  Thus, Cardano could be setting up to resume its downtrend after Vasil goes live in July, which would fall in line with the bear pennant discussed above.

Take a closer look at the world of crypto! Yesterday , ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" author Robert Kiyosaki shared his new BTC price predictions and buy-the-dip plans with his Twitter followers. He started his post with a “rich dad lesson,” writing that losers quit when they lose, while winners learn from their mistakes. Kiyosaki then proceeded by saying that he is waiting for Bitcoin to test $1,100, and that should the king crypto recover after that, he will buy more of it. It is worth noting that, earlier this year, in May, after the Fed launched a historic interest rate hike, the author of ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" tweeted that he thought the bottom for BTC may be at the $17,000 mark. Around the same time, Kiyosaki admitted that Bitcoin may even go below $9,000, but he still remains bullish, as the ""Fed and Treasury are corrupt organizations."" MicroStrategy CEO  Michael Saylor  has recently taken to Twitter to educate crypto investors who are in the process of surviving another bear market. He urged his followers to ""stay humble"" and ""stack sats,"" implying that they should keep increasing their gains calmly, without worrying about market structure. Saylor is a good example for his subscribers as he himself follows his advice; his company continues to expand its Bitcoin stack despite current issues in the whole industry. Additionally, Saylor does not appear concerned about repeatedly purchasing Bitcoin at its peak and holding it at a significant $1.2 billion loss. With over 350 commits made in the previous month,  Cardano  has demonstrated the most development activity in the sector, surpassing projects like Kusama and Polkadot. Ethereum and Solana, both of which have received over 270 commits, are other significant projects near the top. After dropping the smart contract update, the network has consistently been one of the most actively developed projects in the whole industry. One of the most recent updates was the upgrade of stake pool operators on Cardano node 1.35. The new update makes the most recent node version a candidate for the final mainnet Vasil hardfork release. With the launch of the node network, all the ‌updates and fixes will have a soft and stable launch of Vasil. An enormous  Ethereum  buying volume was seen on Binance and another controlled exchange for the ETH/USD pair, indicating that a major investor or anonymous whale was eager to purchase as much ETH as they could for the price of $1,228. According to the chart, the asset’s price has not been affected by that, which suggests that the massive buying is being consumed by massive selling or shorting. Such a large inflow of funds shows that there are still some investors out there who will purchase the digital asset at a significant discount. Unfortunately, the large buying power and the absence of upward volatility on the market may result in problems for Ethereum investors in the future because of imbalance between buy and sell orders.",https://u.today/robert-kiyosaki-awaits-btc-testing-1100-michael-saylor-advises-investors-cardano-becomes-most,utoday,2022-06-29,16:25:00,en

cardano, News , Cardano’s Vasil hard fork proposal submitted: Countdown commences ,"Cardano Blockchain developer Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) has submitted an updated proposal to hard fork the Cardano testnet, kicking off the countdown for the network’s Vasil mainnet upgrade. The Vasil upgrade is slated to bring “significant performance and capability upgrades” to the  blockchain , with IOHK  describing  the fork as the “biggest and best upgrade to date,” providing higher throughput, improved script performance for developers and lower costs. One of the most significant updates pointed out by the team is the implementation of diffusion pipelining aimed at improving the blockchains’ scalability for decentralized applications (DApps). The update will allow faster block creation as they can be transmitted without full validation. If everything goes smoothly, the upgrade to the testnet will take place July 3, with the mainnet upgrade scheduled for roughly around the end of July. The Cardano community requested four weeks minimum to allow time to test and upgrade applications on the testnet. IOHK says the hard fork for the mainnet will take place “once everyone is comfortable and ready.” The Cardano mainnet upgrade was previously  supposed to take place  on Wednesday but was  delayed by a month  on June 22, citing several outstanding bugs. IOHK has called the project the “most complex program of work we’ve undertaken.” IOHK’s “prime concern” is ensuring the upgrade is managed in a “safe and secure” manner. It reports the Vasil node is creating over 75% of the testnet network’s blocks and believes there is “good chain density to proceed safely.” The last significant upgrade to the blockchain was in September 2021 with the  Alonzo hard fork , which brought in long-awaited  smart contract functionality  for the first time using Plutus scripts, a smart contract development language purpose-built for Cardano The upgrade was widely considered to be a disappointment, as Cardano still only has 11 DApps,  according  to DefiLlama. The co-founder of Cardano, Charles Hoskinson, previously predicted there would be “thousands of DApps” on Cardano by 2021 and  believes developers are waiting  for the Vasil upgrade to launch their projects. The Vasil node is named in honor of Vasil Stoyanov Dabov, an artist and Cardano community member and ambassador who passed away in December 2021 after a diagnosis of pulmonary embolism.

This is much higher than the rumored figure of $25 million that was reported by CNBC on Thursday.  
 
Yet, it is worth mentioning that the $240 million deal is at the high end of the price range, which means that the final price of the acquisition could decline significantly. Its final price will depend on ""performance triggers.""

These hard fork changes might be felt on the testnet as soon as July 3. The exchanges and SPOs (stake pool operators) need at least four weeks of testing, which puts the tentative date of the Vasil mainnet hard fork in the last week of July. The Vasil Hard Fork's completion and the conclusion of the final audit could presage the start of the deployment of Djed on the mainnet, according to the Djed team. Djed, Cardano's over-collateralized stablecoin, recently launched on testnet. Recent reports from the team indicate that more than 514,559 tDJED and more than 6,688,918 tSHEN reserve coins have been minted so far, giving a reserve ratio of 653%. To ensure safety, the on-chain code underwent a level 2 audit certification after the testnet launch.

Besides, according to Ledger's recent tweet, ADA has become available for management in Ledger Live on desktop and Android. The Ledger team is currently working on adding compatibility for iOS on both the ledger and Ledger Live platforms. Meanwhile, the International Association for Cryptologic Research (IACR) has accepted IOG’s research paper, ""Ofelimos: Combinatorial Optimization via Proof-of-Useful-Work: A Provably Secure Blockchain Protocol,"" for Crypto 2022. As stated by Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson, this was “pretty relevant to the future of Cardano.” Airwallex, a  Ripple  partner, has announced the launch of its global payment services in New Zealand. Businesses in the country will now have access to Airwallex's global payment services, which act as an alternative to traditional banks. In the meantime, Ripple is going to help its partner, Lotus, a British performance car manufacturer, to enter the NFT market by providing technical support on the XRP Ledger (XRPL) network. Also, the XRP Ledger Foundation (XRPLF) is now home to the authoritative repository for the XRPL protocol code base, Rippled. Nik Bougalis, Ripple's director of engineering, stated that Ripple would continue to contribute to the codebase while also suggesting the introduction of native AMM functionality as the next stage of development for XRPL.

cardano,No Section,Сardano's Vasil Hardfork in Cards: Comprehensive Guide to Most Crucial Upgrade in 2022,"Despite severe criticism, Cardano (ADA) blockchain remains in the top rankings of cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Its dApps ecosystem is rocketing in terms of the number of active applications; that is why its Vasil hardfork is one of the most anticipated events in the blockchain segment in 2022. Cardano (ADA), the largest Proof-of-Stake blockchain and high-performance hosting platform for decentralized applications, is set to undergo an eccentric upgrade of its codebase. The upcoming hardfork is named after Vasil Stoyanov Dabov, a prominent mathematician and passionate Cardano (ADA) enthusiast, who recently passed. So, what changes with Vasil? Introduced in 2015 by Charles Hoskinson, top blockchain developer, entrepreneur, investor and one of Ethereum’s founders, Cardano platform promoted itself as a third-generation blockchain designed to address the bottlenecks of the first (Bitcoin and its forks) and second (Ethereum and its forks) generations of distributed networks. Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and other early blockchains, Cardano (ADA) leverages Proof-of-Stake consensus; it is a far more eco-friendly, democratic and inclusive solution for blockchain systems. The integrity of blockchain and safety of its operations are guaranteed by stakers, i.e., owners of ADA - Cardano’s native blockchain tokens - who delegated them to staking pools. For their contributions, stakers receive periodic rewards in ADA tokens; also, the pools can stimulate their supporters with additional rewards in their native assets. Just like Ethereum, Polygon and BNB Chain, Cardano (ADA) is suitable for running decentralized applications (dApps) of all types. Cardano’s ecosystem has its own programming language, Plutus (based on Haskell), and a low-code instrument for DeFi development dubbed Marlowe. As covered by U.Today, by mid-June 2022, Cardano (ADA) was used as a technical platform by over 1,000 dApps. The majority of them belong to the segment of non-fungible tokens (NFTs): Cardano (ADA) fuels marketplaces, NFTs collections and so on. As such, Cardano’s dApps ecosystem is almost as large as Polygon’s in terms of the net number of active protocols. A hardfork is a radical change of a network’s consensus that results in starting a blockchain that works in accordance with the new rules. All parallel chains (working according to pre-hard fork rules) automatically degrade; their blocks are rejected by validators. The new blockchain can also start operating separately instead of being completely abandoned. For instance, Bitcoin hardfork Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is a textbook example of a successful hardfork; Ethereum and Ethereum Classic also forked from each other in 2016. Cardano blockchain also underwent a number of hardforks; its upgrade, Mary, introduced support for multiple assets, while Alonzo added smart contracts functionality. Cardano is the only mainstream blockchain with a so-called “hardfork coordinator,” a one-of-a-kind mechanism designed to organize network upgrades seamlessly and with minimum friction. As Cardano (ADA) lacks a roadmap and whitepaper, its upgrade announcements usually make headlines in Web3 media. However, the Vasil hardfork is a special one: it addresses the needs of the rapidly growing dApps ecosystem amid a bearish recession. Vasil hadrfork was announced for the first time in early 2022 as a response to the growing popularity of Cardano’s smart contracts in dApps. With Vasil hardfork, the process of dApps onboarding will be more straightforward than ever before. It is also set to make Cardano’s operations faster and cheaper. The updates (Cardano Improvement Proposals, or CIPs) included in Vasil harddfork will lower the volume of transactions, making their execution more resource-optimized. Once the Vasil update is live, the transaction logic will be optimized while the DDoS protection of Cardano (ADA) will be upgraded. CIP-31 implementation is set to introduce so-called “Reference Inputs.” This mechanism addresses EUTXO ledger design drawbacks to improve the scalability and resource efficiency of Cardano (ADA) transactions. With CIP-31, there is no need to “spend” the transaction output to see it. In turn, it allows users to see on-chain data without the full scope of operations associated with spending and recreating UTXOs. This CIP will advance the performance of on-chain data providers and save the network’s resources. With CIP-32 activated, a new type of data units, i.e., “inline datums,” will be attached to transactional outputs instead of datums’ hashes. As with previous CIP, it will streamline communication between various actors in Cardano’s dApps ecosystem and make it more comfortable for both senders and recipients of Cardano’s transactions. Technically, it will reduce the volume of data the participants of the consensus must check to interact with it. As such, decentralized applications will easily adjust their designs to new upgrades to make these operational logics more efficient. The CIP-33 upgrade affects Plutus scripts. These scripts are actually short software programs that are not stored on-chain. As such, every time this or that script is used, the transaction that authorized its usage needs to supply the entire script as part of the transaction. As such, the blockchain is bloated: also, the transaction that uses multiple scripts can easily reach the size limit. With CIP-33 activated, “individual scripts” are replaced by “universal scripts”: transactions with “universal scripts” will be much smaller and, therefore, the blockchain will process them more easily. Last but not least, CIP-40 is poised to push the barriers of DDoS-resistance of Cardano (ADA) blockchain. Collateral outputs are set to improve the transaction validation process. Currently,  if transaction validation fails for this or that transfer, its sender loses collateral. Once CIP-40 is implemented, DDoS protection will be carried out in a more inclusive and fair manner. It also removes the need for wallets to set collateral, which is considered to be an outdated method of DDoS-protection. Just like any major upgrade in modern blockchains, Vasil was proposed without an exact timeline. As of late June 2022, Cardano’s developers from Input Output Global are stress-testing Vasil mechanisms on testing networks. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano’s Vasil is now expected to go live in mainnet by the end of July 2022. Vasil is the most significant update for Cardano (ADA) since the activation of its smart contracts functionality with Alonzo. It includes four CIPs that address data transfer logics and some operations with Plutus scripts. Cardano’s Vasil hardfork is expected to advance its development experience and make dApps transactions faster and cheaper.",https://u.today/guides/cardanos-vasil-hardfork-in-cards-comprehensive-guide-to-most-crucial-upgrade-in-2022,utoday,2022-07-04,09:53:00,en

According to the CTO of  dcspark , it was previously impossible to port a lot of ERC20 tokens on the network because of the missing functionality of the  blockchain . With the Vasil update, Cardano will allow users to utilize and develop a new class of tokens: noncustodials, stablecoins and stateful tokens. A remaining problem is that they will only be at the protocol level, and some time is needed for tooling. As developers get more familiar with the new functions of the hardfork, we will start seeing the first solutions built with the use of new functions. Cardano wallets will also start working differently as they would need to change the method of handling tokens. The massive update was one of the biggest and most anticipated things that has ever happened to the Cardano ecosystem. With the implementation of the update, Cardano will receive a number of important Improvement Proposals (CIPs) that are aimed at updating the network's overall performance and throughput. Smaller changes will affect the optimization of Cardano  network  and make it more developer-friendly, which is an extremely important change for the most actively developed network in the industry. Cardano decentralized applications are expected to become more user-friendly and optimized.

This is an important next step in the journey towards the Vasil upgrade on mainnet.  1/10  pic.twitter.com/9F9vzec0pK — Input Output (@InputOutputHK)  July 3, 2022 
 
 Once completed on the mainnet, the Vasil hard fork will allow faster block creation and greater scalability for  decentralized apps (DApps)  running on Cardano. Input Output HK (IOHK), the organization that produced Cardano, said in a Sunday tweet that in addition to the performance upgrades, developers would  benefit  from “much-improved script performance and efficiency” and lower costs. Vasil will also enable interoperability between Cardano sidechains, one of the main features developers  intend  to launch in the current Basho phase of the blockchain’s development. Basho is the fourth development phase for Cardano that focuses on scaling and will be followed up with the Voltaire phase, in which governance will be the main focus. The Vasil upgrade is now live on testnet, coming to mainnet in a few weeks. Expect Cardano DeFi to go into the rapids from here — ADA whale (@cardano_whale)  July 3, 2022 
 
 IOHK also noted that there would not be a proposal to hard fork the mainnet until “ecosystem partners are comfortable and ready,” but it is expected to come in about four weeks. The previous phase, Goguen, saw the launch of smart contract capabilities on Cardano, which  decentralized finance (DeFi)  developers took advantage of by launching dozens of decentralized exchanges (DEX) and DeFi protocols,  according  to ecosystem tracker Cardano Cube.

Former BitMEX CEO Arthur Hayes  has suggested  that the recent price spike may mark the bottom of the recent correction.      
 
Last week, the flagship cryptocurrency logged its worst quarter in more than a decade, shedding more than half of its value. 
 
While many technical signals may indicate that the cryptocurrency has already reached the bottom of this correction, there are also those analysts who remain on the fence. 
 
Ross Mayfield, investment strategy analyst at US-based multinational independent financial services company Baird, recently  told Bloomberg  that the Bitcoin price could potentially plunge much lower. He explains that the largest cryptocurrency is currently dealing with “a challenging environment.”

cardano,No Section,This Rare Cardano Smart Contract Usage Might Be Possible After Vasil HFC: Details,"Sebastien Guillemot , CTO and co-founder of dcSpark, has shared a rare Cardano smart contract usage that might become possible after the Vasil hard fork upgrade. Thought: pause-able contracts on Cardano after the Vasil fork. 
 
How: make all usage of the contract need a reference input that contains an NFT w/ an open minting policy. If dApp author wants to pause their contract, they burn the NFT and then re-mint it when to unpause The rare usage pertains to ""pause-able"" contracts, which need a reference input that contains an NFT with an open minting policy. If the dApp author wants to ""pause"" the contract, the NFT is burned and then reminted when the need to ""unpause"" arises. Likewise, a stateful contract in which the NFT's UTXO contains a pause state as an inline datum does not need an open policy and allows for draining the contract after it has been paused might also serve this purpose. The aforementioned inline datums and reference inputs are two of the enhancements that the Vasil hard fork will bring about. These include four different CIPs: CIP-31 (Reference Inputs), CIP-32 (Inline Datums), CIP-33 (Reference Scripts) and CIP-40 (Collateral Outputs). Reference inputs (CIP-31) allow multiple dApps to be able to read from the same datum at the same time, thus improving concurrency. Inline datum (CIP-32), on the other hand, allows data to be saved on-chain instead of merely a hash, as Cardano does now. Developers can interact with the script more easily because they do not have to incorporate the data. Amid an accumulation drive, Cardano has returned as one of the most actively traded by the top whales. According to WhaleStats, ADA ranks in the top 10 by trading volume among the  1,000 biggest BSC whales  in the last 24 hours. Also, the top 4,000 BSC whales are ""hodling"" $16,026,80 worth of ADA.

Lead developer of  Shiba Inu  Shytoshi Kusama has teased the SHIB community with a mysterious tweet posted on his official account, saying that soon he will have “a LOT to say.” The post has left canine coin enthusiasts with lots of unanswered questions, but they were not given a chance to speculate on the news, since Kusama closed the comments section under the tweet in question. At the moment of publication, Shiba Inu’s lead developer has not yet posted any updates on his puzzling announcement. Meanwhile, the price of SHIB dropped an additional zero as its price recovered once again to support levels of $0.00001. On Sunday, Input Output announced that Cardano’s  Vasil hard fork  has been launched on the blockchain’s testnet. According to the company, the event signified an “important next step” in the implementation of the much-anticipated upgrade. In the course of the next month, Vasil will be going through testing conducted by stake pool operators, developers and cryptocurrency exchanges. After that, the hard fork will be triggered on the blockchain’s mainnet. The Vasil upgrade is expected to significantly improve the blockchain’s performance capabilities by ensuring higher throughput and enabling interoperability. According to  Tharman Shanmugaratnam , the senior minister and head of the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the MAS could put restrictions on individuals' participation in the crypto market, as well as implement rules related to margin trading. He added that Singapore has consistently pursued a strategy of restricting individuals' access to cryptocurrency transactions over the past five years, prohibiting the advertising of crypto services in public places, as well as the installation of crypto ATMs there. While all crypto companies in Singapore are required to abide by the January MAS guidelines, the regulator has the authority to apply additional rules under the Payment Service Act (PS Act) in order to protect customers and maintain the stability of the financial system.

Gerber wrote that the gold bug has tried to talk him into moving to the Caribbean island for tax reasons. Ross Gerber ended his post with “and he still hasn’t figured out Bitcoin,” possibly implying that had the BTC antagonist embraced the flagship crypto, he could have avoided his current struggles. Per the article, the Puerto Rican bank regulator recently suspended the operations of Schiff’s Euro Pacific Bank as part of an investigation.

However, Coutts touched on three specific areas: Input endorsers, peer-to-peer networking and Vasil hard fork. Input endorsers aim to improve block propagation times and refer to one of the 11 ways in which Cardano wants to achieve scaling in 2022. Input endorsers allow for higher transaction rates by allowing transactions to be separated into pre-constructed blocks. Improvements to Ouroboros, the proof-of-stake consensus protocol for Cardano, might be necessary for the success of input endorsers. The IOG Principal Technical Architect mentions that work is ongoing to release a new version of Ouroboros, which can scale to utilize all the available resources on Cardano's servers. Also, IOG is developing a new stage of Ouroboros called Leios. Peer-to-peer networking is an additional step toward giving the community control over the network. Cardano is powered by distributed nodes, which are managed by stake pool operators. Up until recently, IOG has been running nodes to aid in establishing node-to-node connectivity, supported by a topology developed by the community. This IOG connectivity structure will be eliminated by peer-to-peer networking, which will instead foster direct communication between peers.

cardano,No Section,Cardano-based Revuto Starts Offering Subscriptions as NFTs,"A new instrument by one of Croatia's leading start-ups is set to unlock new opportunities for the segment of subscription and for the entire ""real-world"" Web3 implementations segment. According to the official statement shared by the  Revuto  team, its ecosystem has started offering a completely new type of cryptocurrency tokens, i.e., ""tokenized subscriptions."" Revulution  #NFTs  are an opportunity that you don’t want to miss. 💪 
 
Would you like to have free  #Netflix  or  #Spotify  for a lifetime? 🎉 
 
We've got some amazing features coming out that will totally Revulutionize  #subscriptions . 🚀 
 
Read all about it👇 https://t.co/dNKGdXp4pK   pic.twitter.com/zdMX1kjJ24 Thanks to a partnership with Railsr (former Railsbank), a crypto-friendly digital banking heavyweight, Revuto is now available to sell subscritions to Spotify and Netflix as non-fungible tokens (NFTs); the provider just issued a virtual card to pay for the subscriptions. The new instrument, dubbed ""Revulution NFTs,"" will also be avaliable for sale on secondary markets; users will be free to trade them on third-party platforms. Once this or that ""Revulution NFT"" is sold, Revuto closes the associated virtual card and transfers the rights to another customer. Vedran Vukman, CEO and co-founder of Revuto, stresses that this instrument can be profitable for both traders and holders of cryptocurrency: Based on the feedback we received from our 350,000 active and verified users, we have decided to give the community exactly what they have asked for – a solution that guarantees a stable subscription fee, that they can share with their friends or family members in a simple and straightforward way. Moreover, in case they are not using the service, the users can simply get their money back or even profit from selling the NFTs. Josipa Majić, co-founder of Revuto, is sure that new services besides Spotify and Netflix will soon be integrated into Revuto's ecosystem: Our Revulution NFT for Netflix or Spotify is just the start, and also an introduction to the subscription NFTs that people will be able to use to pay for any subscription in the world, for however long they want. Also, by using this particular innovation, the users will get discounts when selecting their subscriptions, coupled with the possibility of either gifting or selling them to other users. With such a unique approach, Revuto is introducing something completely new to the world of subscriptions, something that will enable the creation of an entirely new market of prepaid unused subscriptions. The first token sale will kick off at 12.00 p.m. (CET) on July 11, 2022. NFTs will be offered for $349 in equivalent on the official Revuto website. Visitors will be able to pay for the NFTs with both fiat (credit, debit cards) or cryptocurency.",https://u.today/cardano-based-revuto-starts-offering-subscriptions-as-nfts,utoday,2022-07-08,11:40:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Robinhood Introduces New Feature for SHIB, Solana Hit with Class-Action Lawsuit, DOGE Back Above Crucial Price Level: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today has prepared a summary of the top four news stories over the past day. According to the official announcement on Twitter,  Robinhood , a popular trading app, introduced a new option for crypto transfers. From now on, its users can send and receive all digital assets available on the platform, including Shiba Inu and Bitcoin. The news was retweeted by Shiba Inu’s official Twitter account, scoring more than 6,000 likes from thrilled members of the SHIB community. As  reported by U.Today , Robinhood finally added support for the second biggest meme crypto in early April after a Change.org petition asking the company to list SHIB got more than half a million votes. Earlier this year, the trading app launched a noncustodial wallet, making it possible for traders to manage their own crypto. Solana Labs  has been hit with a class-action lawsuit, which could have massive implications for the cryptocurrency industry. Mark Young, the lead plaintiff, alleges that SOL token is an unregistered security. As written in the complaint, SOL token satisfies the Howey test, supporting the conclusion that the asset is a security, since the project’s success and its potential returns were dependent on Solana's ability to deliver on its promise to create the network. Young claims that the defendants managed to make ""enormous"" profits with the help of the cryptocurrency. The plaintiff has also accused Solana Labs of making “deliberately misleading” statements about the circulating supply of SOL securities. Young wants the court to award him and other class members damages ""in an amount to be proved at trial."" Dogecoin , the original meme coin, has managed to climb back to the $0.07 price level after more than half a month since plunging in early June. DOGE owes its triumphant return to Elon Musk and his The Boring Company; the centibillionaire’s company now allows customers to pay with Dogecoin for a ride on the Loop, its Las Vegas transit system. Some other news about DOGE adoption and overall positive sentiment on the market have also played a part. Earlier this week, it became known that DOGE was accepted as  payment for products  from WeCook, a Canadian food tech start-up. And last Tuesday,  FTX Japan , one of the top crypto exchanges, announced adding support for the canine coin. All of this positive news perfectly overlapped on the Dogecoin chart, which was actively signaling a possible breakout of an important price level. Charles Hoskinson , CEO at Input Output, addresses the fear, uncertainty and doubt (“FUD”) that surrounded the upcoming Vasil Hard fork in a recent tweet, stating that the blockchain’s smart contracts will still function after the implementation of the much-awaited upgrade. This comes after some Twitter users started claiming that  Cardano’s  smart contracts will need to be rewritten as they are incompatible with the Vasil hard fork. Input Output’s vice president of community and ecosystem Tim Harrison rushed to reassure Cardano enthusiasts, explaining that current dApps that use the first version of the Plutus smart contract platform will still be compatible after the Vasil upgrade. Those developers who want to take advantage of all the enhancements offered by Plutus V2 will have to utilize and deploy them in their applications.",https://u.today/robinhood-introduces-new-feature-for-shib-solana-hit-with-class-action-lawsuit-doge-back-above,utoday,2022-07-08,16:23:00,en

As a result of the rebalancing, the Digital Large Cap Fund no longer includes Bitcoin Cash, Chainlink, Litecoin, Polkadot and Uniswap.

Additionally, Grayscale disclosed that it had trimmed the GSCPxE Fund's portfolio by selling some of the current fund components per their respective weightings.

cardano,No Section,"Bitcoin Is Getting Ready for 20% Rally: Crypto Market Review, July 8","Bitcoin surprised cryptocurrency investors with its unexpected 9% rally that pushed the first  cryptocurrency  above $22,000, which could be the beginning of the previously mentioned potential rally that the weakening of the U.S. Dollar and  volatility  spike would cause. As previously  mentioned  on U.Today, the U.S. Dollar remains the main source of pressure on the cryptocurrency market as investors still prefer less risky options rather than volatile assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum. But the comfortable position of the U.S. Dollar could have a temporary effect on the cryptocurrency market as the Fed's hawkishness might not fuel the world's leading currency's rally long enough, especially if the regulator calms down on upcoming rate hikes. With the weakening of the U.S. Dollar, we will most likely see Bitcoin breakout in the upcoming weeks as it is already craving volatile moves that will break the two-week streak of anemic performance. As the technical analysis suggests, Bitcoin successfully broke upward from the pennant previously highlighted by Peter Brandt and rushed toward $22,000. Unfortunately, the lack of inflows to the market and low  open interest  caused BTC to drop below the local resistance of $21,800.  The second biggest cryptocurrency on the market reaches the pivotal resistance on the chart as the network's financial performance is weaker than ever. According to Token Terminal data,  Ethereum  generated around $23.8 million in supply side and protocol revenue in July, making it the worst month since summer 2020. The main reason behind a rapid drop in the network's revenue is the massive outflow of funds from the DeFi and NFT industries that carried the Ethereum bullrun in 2021. The final blow that pushed Ethereum down was the lack of activity around the Web3 industry that should have been the next driver of the cryptocurrency market. On the daily chart, Ethereum has reached the local resistance of $1,250 and is currently failing to break through it. The reversal at $1,200 will most likely push it back to the consolidation channel for another few days. Generally, the cryptocurrency industry remains under heavy macroeconomic pressure as demand for risk exposure is still at an extremely low level compared to 2021, which is caused by constant rate hikes and a bleeding stock market. The majority of financial analysts expect a gradual recovery until the middle of 2023.",https://u.today/bitcoin-is-getting-ready-for-20-rally-crypto-market-review-july8,utoday,2022-07-08,15:01:00,en

I'm delighted to see John step up as a CTO, and it opens up many great opportunities for future collaboration and research. Algorand is an excellent project with exceptional people.  https://t.co/nzIGqzSAVz The Cardano creator also praised the Algorand community, saying, ""Algorand is an excellent project with exceptional people,"" adding that new prospects for future research and collaboration between the two projects might be in place. John Alan Woods worked briefly to stand in for Duncan Coutts, IOG's principal technical architect, who went on paternity leave but has now returned to his full duties. In a recent interview, Coutts expressed his delight at the scope of current development at Cardano and mentioned that a lot of big-impact projects were in the pipeline. One instance is the Vasil upgrade, which is a part of the Basho phase and focuses on scaling and network and ledger optimization while bringing forth numerous enhancements to the ledger. Cardano's hard-fork combinator (HFC), a cutting-edge technology that implements seamless protocol transitions and ledger upgrades while minimizing disturbance for end-users, will be used to deploy Vasil at the protocol level. A new  Cardano book  for newcomers has also been introduced by IOG as part of its push for crypto education: Cardano for the Masses: A Financial Operating System for People Who Don't Have One. At the time of publication, Cardano's total value locked (TVL) in DeFi remained largely unchanged at $120.51 million. Contributing largely to this is the Wingriders DEX, with 42.21% dominance. Notably, in the past month, Wingriders Fluid tokens and ADAX Pro faced increases of 54.72%, 52,688% and 139%, respectively.

Since the launch of Cardano-based smart contracts in September 2021, Cardano NFTs, or CNFTs, have been able to take their share of this fast-growing and extremely popular segment of the crypto market. One could argue that  Cardano (ADA)  is currently one of three ecosystems, along with Ethereum (ETH) and Solana (SOL), with constant releases of NFT projects. NFTs on Cardano are particularly popular with hip-hop stars. Recently, for example, rapper Soulja Boy asked where he could buy CNFTs, saying they looked very ""spicy."" Then on April 5, after CNFT's ""Clay Nation"" collection was released with support from Snoop Dogg and his son  Champ Medici , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  met with the Long Beach rapper  to discuss joint projects.

He alleges that the firm misrepresented user data as regards the number of automated accounts, known as spam bots, on its platform. This inevitably lays the groundwork for a protracted legal battle.

The Twitter Board is committed to closing the transaction on the price and terms agreed upon with Mr. Musk and plans to pursue legal action to enforce the merger agreement. We are confident we will prevail in the Delaware Court of Chancery. Court experts predict that the legal dispute might end in a settlement in which Musk is compelled to buy Twitter, possibly on modified conditions. As previously reported by U.Today, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson proposed building a new decentralized social media platform from scratch with Tesla's Elon Musk in case the billionaire’s attempt to take over Twitter fails.

Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, predicted the bear market months in advance while discussing the underperformance of the native ADA cryptocurrency. Hoskinson agreed that no announcement could change anything. Therefore, despite the protocol's developing technical functionalities and the expanding community, the ADA price might continue to struggle to gain any traction.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Network Stands Near 60% Under Utilization, Data Finds","At present, the  Cardano network  is utilizing, on average, about 40% of its capacity. This may not be optimal because Cardano's Ouroboros protocol is built to handle massive amounts of data as well as transactions and scripts of varying complexity and size, so the most effective scenario is for Cardano to operate at or close to 100% of its capacity. In a drive to increase  transaction throughput , IOHK has increased the block-size limit twice this year to allow for more transactions per block. The block size was increased from 64KB to 80KB, and then further to the present 88KB. Larger block sizes imply that more transactions can fit into a block, thus increasing capacity for users. According to IOHK, increasing the throughput of a blockchain such as Cardano is security-critical as admitting more load to the system may open up the potential for DoS attacks. As a result, it follows a deliberate and careful process when making such changes. In the past week, the  IOG teams  hard forked the Cardano testnet to Vasil functionality. The teams are currently updating dependencies and closely collaborating with SPOs and the community to resolve testnet issues, according to the most recent weekly report. Pipelining maintainability and the addition of tests for greater confidence and regression prevention are still being worked on.

The supply of WRT is limited to 100 million tokens, so it is  deflationary . That said, it will be possible to farm the token, albeit to a  limited extent of 40 million . WRT can be used to buy NFTs and cryptocurrencies at a discount to regular trading pairs. WRT can also be used as collateral currency for agents coming to WingRiders. Eight million WRTs will be available for public sale, while 12 million WRTs have been  distributed privately .

#9: 337 Hedera-hashgraph 
#10: 287 Internet-computer In the past week,  IOHK  reported a weekly Github commit of 3028, according to its Friday evaluation report. With 13,003 Github changes made in  June , development activity on the Cardano (ADA) network has continued to increase. As developers prepare for the upcoming Vasil hard fork, activity on all Cardano repositories has increased. The Vasil upgrade hopes to bring significant performance and capability enhancements to Cardano and is expected to include four Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs). The Cardano network has been steadily advancing over the past several years. Since the implementation of staking via Shelley,  Vasil  has been the most significant network enhancement, according to IOHK. The upgrade, which is part of the Basho phase, is projected to provide numerous enhancements to the Cardano ledger and also improve smart contracts. In 2020, the Byron reboot gave a community of over 3,000 SPOs the opportunity to build and support the proof-of-stake network. Also, users were able to develop a variety of local assets to trade and exchange on the ledger thanks to the Mary improvement in early 2021, and in September 2021, Alonzo launched smart contracts support. According to  CoinMarketCap  data, Cardano's ADA price is marginally down over the last 24-hour period to now trade at $0.427.",https://u.today/cardano-leads-in-daily-development-activity-data-reveals,utoday,2022-07-13,11:04:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Mocks Chinese Banking Crisis with Ironic Statement,"The founder of Cardano, famous crypto-entrepreneur Charles Hoskinson,  ironically commented  on the situation around China's banking system. Hoskinson expressed his regret that the world has no  digital cash system  that does not require reserve storage and is available anywhere in the world. With his statement, the Cardano founder, of course, alluded to cryptocurrencies and blockchain, which in his opinion are a real and valid alternative to traditional finance. If only we had some sort of digital cash system that doesn't require fractional reserve storage and is always available anywhere in the world...  https://t.co/Hk6VoFySBi Since April 2022, four rural banks in central China's Henan province have frozen millions of dollars in deposits, threatening the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of their customers at a time in which the economy has already been hit by pandemic restrictions. Later, concerned depositors staged demonstrations in Zhengzhou, the administrative center of the province. At moments of greater escalation, the Chinese authorities began to disperse the riot. The situation is really unpleasant, especially considering that it is probably just the beginning of a  possible crisis . Nevertheless, China is known to be a fierce opponent of cryptocurrencies, and Chinese residents have not even had the opportunity to use any digital cash system, be it Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano (ADA) or Ripple (XRP). Going back to Hoskinson's words, if we look at the situation in the world as a whole, we can say that at the moment states are not very concerned about the transfer of their financial markets to blockchain or the introduction of cryptocurrencies as one of the elements of the payment system.  Given the popular rhetoric , officials of most countries at the moment are considering only the option of  limiting private cryptocurrencies  and introducing their own state digital currencies, while the implementation and adoption of coins like SHIB, XRP or BTC is more likely a matter for a small number of private enterprises.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-mocks-chinese-banking-crisis-with-ironic-statement,utoday,2022-07-13,14:46:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Bitcoin, Altcoins and Market Tumble Down as Inflation Hits 40-Year High of 9.1%: Crypto Market Review, July 13","Once again, inflation data is exceeding market expectations and, once again, we are seeing a flash crash of the digital assets market that removed the major portion of the profit the cryptocurrency market gained  today . As mentioned in our previous market review, inflation data is the only driver remaining on the market in the short-term, as the lack of news and volatility on the market makes it impossible to forecast the movement of digital  assets . Unfortunately, the expectations of the market were wrong once again as the most recent rate hike did not have the desired effect on inflation and its forecast. An unexpectedly high inflation report means that the hawkishness of the Fed and stricter monetary policy are here to stay for a long time. It is not yet clear how sharp the upcoming rate hike is going to be, but it is clear that the financial regulator has no other choice but to tame inflation until its acceleration reaches dangerous values that the Fed will not be able to control without seriously damaging the economy. While the long-term situation on the market seems quite grim, even the unexpectedly high inflation data and continuous strengthening of the U.S. dollar did not have a devastating effect on Bitcoin and the cryptocurrency market in general. Compared to June, we saw a less volatile and more stable performance of the first cryptocurrency after the unpleasant announcement that pretty much confirms the continuation of the bear market. More volatile cryptocurrencies like Ethereum or XRP are also moving in their daily price range without showing any abnormal volatility. Prior to the release of the long-awaited data, crypto traders and investors were massively shorting Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as netflow to exchange-traded funds that provide investors with short Bitcoin exposure reported almost $15 million of inflows in one day only. Despite the increase in the number of short positions and expectations of a massive crash, Bitcoin has lost around 1% of its value in the last 24 hours while the biggest altcoins are at a 2-3% loss. The key rate meeting in July will be the next big event for the cryptocurrency market, as it is going to have a direct effect on the behavior of cryptocurrency market participants. If the rate hike remains in the previously announced range, no major movements are expected. If the Fed decides to raise the bar and surprise the market with a stronger hike, we may in fact face a spike in volatility like we saw back at the beginning of the month when the price of the first cryptocurrency plunged from $31,000 to $17,000 in a matter of days.",https://u.today/bitcoin-altcoins-and-market-tumble-down-as-inflation-hits-40-year-high-of-91-crypto-market-review,utoday,2022-07-13,14:36:00,en
cardano,No Section,"BREAKING: Bitcoin Plunges Below $19,000 as Inflation Soars","Bitcoin, the top cryptocurrency by market capitalization, has dropped to an intraday low of $18,916 on the Bitstmap exchange after the Labor Department reported that the consumer price index (CPI) had risen to a whopping 9.1%. The world's largest cryptocurrency has so far shed more than 5% on the news, reaching the lowest level since July 4. The S&P 500 index also shed 1.6%. The hotter-than-expected inflation reading will put even more pressure on the U.S. Federal Reserve to hike interest rates. On Monday, the BLS had to issue a statement after a fake CPI report made waves on social media and sent stock futures lower. The bogus leak showed that inflation skyrocketed to 10.2%, which is far above analysts' expectations. While the real CPI print is more than a percentage point level, it is still the highest level since November 1981. 
 
Fed Fund s  futures are now pricing at an 80 basis point interest rate increase following the CPI print. This, of course, will not bode well for cryptocurrency prices. The latest inflation print, which is above analysts' target of 8.8%, is highly likely to prompt the U.S. Federal Reserve to adopt a more hawkish monetary policy. This would deliver another big blow to speculation-driven investments like cryptocurrencies. Had the reading been below 8.8%, it would have given the markets a big boost. However, the Fed will not take its foot off the tightening pedal because of peaking inflation. It remains to be seen whether the U.S. central bank will opt for a gargantuan 100 basis point hike, which would be catastrophic for speculative investments. Presently, the swaps market is pricing on a 42% chance that the Fed will go that far in order to tame out-of-control inflation. The odds of a 100 basis point hike were at just 8% on July 12, the day before the most recent CPI print was announced. Failing to perform as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin has tumbled together with other risk assets this year, plunging by almost 72%. In March 2020, the Fed slashed interest rates by 100 basis points, bringing back the era of near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing pioneered by former Fed chair Ben Bernanke in 2008. The unprecedented effort to shore up the pandemic-hit U.S. economy led to the biggest cryptocurrency bull market to date. However, the bubble quickly popped after the central banked dialed back its support, bringing the era of free money to an end. 
 
This, of course, creates a major problem for the Bitcoin narrative. Prominent analyst Jim Bianco recently opined that Bitcoiners secretly hope for more money printing and lower inflation so that their favorite cryptocurrency would rally together with stocks. As  reported by U.Today , Bitcoin's correlation with the Nasdaq 100 index is approaching a new record high.",https://u.today/breaking-bitcoin-plunges-below-19000-as-inflation-soars,utoday,2022-07-13,13:41:00,en

If inflation data brings us an unexpected ""surprise,"" both  digital assets  and stock markets are going to take yet another hit. The most recent CPI data greatly exceeded the expectations of the market and became a catalyst for the latest sell-off on the cryptocurrency market that pushed the price of Bitcoin far below $20,000, making the foreseeable future of the digital assets market questionable. US June CPI will be released today at 12:30 UTC.

Ahead of the data release, cryptocurrency markets remain anemic as the main narrative on the market remains bearish while most digital assets are extremely oversold, making shorting and betting on the further plunge too risky.

Another 2-4 weeks delay I guess."" Most of the bugs reported here concerns the `cardano-cli` which is ""just"" the command-line utility and the Haskell high-level interface interface. 
 
So far, the node itself, i.e. the ledger, network and consensus bits seem pretty stable. KtorZ, technical director of open-source development at the Cardano Foundation, says the node, ledger, network and consensus bits appear to be somewhat stable so far. He added that the issues reported were not impactful as they concerned Cardano-CLI: ""Most of the bugs reported here concern the 'Cardano-CLI,' which is 'just' the command-line utility and the Haskell high-level interface. We should perhaps consider taking the 'Cardano-CLI' out in its own repository. That's a separate development stream after all."" Cardano's parent company, IOHK, first reported a delay in sending the hard fork update proposal to the testnet in late June. The company claimed it required additional time for testing, with seven ""non-severe"" bugs unresolved at the time. The IOG team hard forked the testnet on July 3 as development progressed, thus starting the final countdown to the mainnet hard fork. After that, it stated that it wanted to give exchanges and SPOs four weeks to complete any necessary testing and integration work. The working hypothesis is that a Cardano mainnet hard fork should take place during the last week of July, according to IOHK. The number of Plutus-based  smart contracts  operating on the Cardano ecosystem has reached a new milestone of 2,900. The upcoming Vasil HFC Event would implement changes like 
 
• Inline datums (CIP-32) 
 
• Reference inputs (CIP-31) 
 
This would enable a better data availability (DA) 
 
But to implement scalability solutions like Input Endorsers 
 
a dedicated DA solution would be necessary According to a recent tweet thread on data availability by the  Orbis project , building a roll-up on top of Cardano is challenging because its full node size is much smaller than that of blockchains like Ethereum. Improvements like Inline datums (CIP-32) and Reference inputs (CIP-31) that enhance data availability will be implemented as part of the next Vasil HFC event.",https://u.today/cardano-vasil-developer-debunks-possibility-of-likely-delay,utoday,2022-07-13,15:57:00,en

Now the ADA, having fallen into the $0.6-$0.42 range in early May, is trading at a strong support level, which is the lower boundary of the aforementioned price corridor. The $0.4 per ADA level was last crossed in February 2021, which means that all of the growth from then to now has been erased. Is this a good time to add ADA tokens to your portfolio? Perhaps, given the cited statistics from Santiment and the soon-to-be-implemented  Vasil hard fork , the massive long-anticipated update of the Cardano network.

Prize-winning places were formed as follows: Ethereum (ETH) came first with $24.7 million in revenue, BNB Chain from Binance came second with $4.7 million and Bitcoin (BTC) was third with $2.8 million. Despite being only third in terms of revenue, the granddaddy of all cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin, managed to outperform its younger and more  technologically advanced  competitors in terms of seven-day revenue trend and price change dynamics. Thus, Bitcoin's revenue for the period under study showed a 34.7% increase, compared to figures of 3.9% and -1.6% for Ethereum and BNB Chain, respectively. The price of the asset itself, which many take as the  main benchmark  when assessing the state of the crypto market, showed a decline of 3.6% over seven days.

The blockchain, created by research and development company Input Output and led by renowned crypto enthusiast Charles Hoskinson, managed to earn $74,500 during the period under review, while showing one of the worst revenue trends, -6.5%. The cause is most likely due to the  decline in the value  of the native blockchain's token, ADA, which is actively used in Cardano's operations. ADA's price has fallen 9.7% over the course of the study. Of the other ranking participants, we would also like to highlight Polygon (MATIC).Ethereum Layer 2 scaling platform generated $181,000 in revenue in seven days, with the price of the native blockchain token, MATIC, up 17.9%.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Surged 25% Last Time This Pattern Played Out,"Technical and on-chain indicators remain two main tools for analyzing and predicting movements on the cryptocurrency market, but besides them,  investors  ‌often use sentiment-based indicators that can help to determine when the asset is overbought or oversold and when is the time to get out. The sentiment indicator developed by santiment on-chain analysis platform shows that Cardano's price action caused the biggest drop in sentiment toward the eighth-biggest asset in the world by the market  capitalization . Such strong negativity toward Cardano was seen back in January and caused the spike in volatility that resulted in a 24% price increase in five days. It then dragged the sentiment around the coin back to the positivity zone. The fundamental factor that comes into play is the Vasil Hard fork, which brings new functions and possibilities to developers who are creating projects and solutions on Cardano or moving them from chains like Solidity or Ethereum. The rising number of new projects will attract new users and increase the usability of the platform, hence its revenue, which directly affects the price of ADA on the market. A secondary factor is that Cardano is one of the most technically oversold assets on the cryptocurrency market. Such a large selling pressure does not make sense compared to the fundamental growth of the project. One could tie the main reason behind the abnormal price performance to the large number of small holders that constantly create pressure on the price of ADA whenever it manages to enter a recovery rally and gain some  momentum .

Still,  Michael Saylor  calls ADA a security, while, according to Hoskinson, the only real use-case for Bitcoin is to speculate and despite this, nobody calls BTC a security. Charles also warned that if Bitcoin does not work the way Saylor expects it to, he will go bankrupt. Overall, Cardano founder admitted that he does not pay much attention to these claims of the MicroStrategy CEO and he does not think arguing with him about ADA would be a productive conversation. He also shared his view of Bitcoin maximalists, calling them “the most difficult, toxic and useless people to engage with”.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-responds-to-michael-saylor-calling-ada-security-heres-what-he-says,utoday,2022-07-16,13:15:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano's Founder: Blockchain Can Radically Transform Governance,"Charles Hoskinson, CEO and co-founder of IOG, the software studio behind Cardano (ADA) blockchain solutions, shared his views on the prospects of blockchain-based instruments in governmental systems. Mr. Hoskinson sat down with Yahoo Finance's  The Crypto Mile podcast  to discuss the most promising use cases for blockchain systems in governance solutions. Imagine tax revenue is open source, everybody can see where money is coming from, where it's going and traditional institutions of governance develop in efficiency + efficacy at same rate as iPhone. Blockchain and Gov with Charles Hoskinson  @IOHK_Charles   https://t.co/PqVJsh9G2o Hoskinson says that as distributed, democratic and permissionless systems, blockchain systems can make public services more accessible than ever before: It enables the poorest and most vulnerable person in society equal access as the president of the US, and there has never been a time in human history that that has been the case. Also, it can prevent one nation (USA, China) from obtaining overwhelming control over global political processes. This, in turn, will increase the quality of governance: It is a better way of doing things with less friction, less fraud, less waste and abuse and more transparency and ultimately less consolidation of power. Alongside that, blockchain-based governmental systems will be seamlessly interoperable with the same systems in other countries. To start with, the public services sphere boasts numerous use cases crucial to the adoption of blockchain technology, such as land contracts, commercial and government voting, health information, educational credentials, tax and legal information and so on. To study various aspects of decentralization and its use for governance use cases, IOG is going to create a new entity within its partnership with the University of Edinburgh. Mr. Hoskinson stressed that his team will study all blockchains, including Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH), to find out the most suitable one for such use cases. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) inches closer to its most crucial update in months, the Vasil hard fork. It is set to optimize the transactional logics of Cardano (ADA) and make it more suitable for seamless dApps onboarding.",https://u.today/cardanos-founder-blockchain-can-radically-transform-governance,utoday,2022-07-16,12:28:00,en
cardano,No Section,Is Crypto Low In? Crypto Analyst Shares His Take,"In a  recent Twitter thread , Raoul Pal, CEO at Real Vision, claims that the cryptocurrency market has ""probably"" reached the bottom. 
 
The prominent analyst told his more than 966,000 Twitter followers that that macro turn was ""very close."" Pal predicts that the bond yields have already topped. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note was a hair's breadth away from reaching the 3.5% mark in early June. It should be noted that Pal's opinions should be taken with a big grain of salt. Following the collapse of Terra in late May, the analyst claimed that he never owned or recommended the tokens from the failed ecosystem, but a video of him claiming that the project was basically ""risk-free"" later emerged on social media. 
 
Pal is also known for making some notoriously wrong price predictions. Last September, he predicted that the price of Bitcoin would surge to as high as $400,000 by Mach 2022. Of course, the top cryptocurrency failed to come anywhere close to that target after peaking at $69,000 in November and entering a brutal bear market.",https://u.today/is-crypto-low-in-crypto-analyst-shares-his-take,utoday,2022-07-18,15:32:00,en
cardano,No Section,"BTC Analysts Predicts “Big Short Squeeze,” SHIB Gets Listed by Bittrex, Jed McCaleb Keeps His Last 5 Million XRP to Himself: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","Let’s take a look at what happened in the crypto industry over the weekend with U.Today’s top four news stories. According to a prediction by CryptoQuant CEO  Ki Young Ju , Bitcoin could soon see a massive short squeeze. In a recent tweet, Young Ju pointed out that many traders continued to accumulate short positions in the $10,000–$20,000 range in late 2020 only to get liquidated later. A situation like this might occur right now, giving Bitcoin a shot in the arm. According to Ju, the possibility that Bitcoin could undergo another big short squeeze does not indicate the beginning of a new bullish cycle. It does, however, suggest that the cryptocurrency is on the verge of bottoming out. Bitcoin fell as low as $17,600 last month before experiencing a slight relief rally. Yet another major cryptocurrency exchange has embraced  Shiba Inu , to the great delight of the memecoin’s community. On Friday, July 15, it became known that SHIB has been officially listed on top U.S. crypto exchange Bittrex. The listing was long-awaited by SHIB enthusiasts as the token’s rival, Dogecoin, was listed on Bittrex in September 2018. Since last year, Shiba Inu has been added by several well-known cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase, Gemini and others. As reported by U.Today, Bitstamp eventually listed SHIB in June, while stock trading app Robinhood did so in April. XRP Ledger co-creator and former Ripple CTO  Jed McCaleb  decided to keep the remaining 5 million XRP to himself, explaining that he is doing so “just in case it moons.” In a Zoom call with CTC News reporters, McCaleb stated that it would be stupid if he sold all of his XRP since, in case the token’s price goes to $589, he could become rich. The former Ripple CTO also attributes his decision to “this feeling” that holding the rest of his XRP is going to give him and his family more security. Since leaving Ripple in 2014, McCaleb has sold many millions of XRP, and as of the most recent reports from Jed's tacostand Twitter account, he still holds roughly 5 million XRP. Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  shared his thoughts on Michael Saylor calling ADA a security during the latest AMA session. He compared Michael Saylor to Tone Vayes, who used to call everything, except Bitcoin, a scam. Hoskinson reminded his followers that Cardano is far more decentralized than Bitcoin and has far more utility than BTC, which is merely a store of value. According to the Cardano founder, for some reason nobody calls BTC a security, even though the only real use case for Bitcoin is to speculate. Overall, Hoskinson admitted that he does not pay much attention to the MicroStrategy CEO’s claims and does not think arguing with him about ADA would be a productive conversation.",https://u.today/btc-analysts-predicts-big-short-squeeze-shib-gets-listed-by-bittrex-jed-mccaleb-keeps-his-last-5,utoday,2022-07-18,16:10:00,en
cardano,No Section,ADA's Short-Term Price Predictions Leave Cardano Community Baffled: Details,"The latest  ADA predictions  from the Finders poll seem to have left members of the Cardano community baffled. Never ceases to be hilarious that the same folks who would have given you $1000 targets on  $LUNA  last year don’t see the point of ADA. Truly the greatest and most brilliant of minds  https://t.co/n68XJsD3fJ In recently published predictions by  finder.com , the site's researchers polled 53 fintech specialists to forecast the future price of Cardano (ADA). According to the survey's participants, Cardano is expected to end the year at $0.63. The panel was mostly bearish on Cardano in the short term, but predictions for those polled were divided. Matt Lobel, the creator of PLAYN, predicts that ADA might increase to $1.50 by the end of 2022, and Martin Froehler, CEO of Morpher, concurs. He predicts that the value of ADA will reach $1 by the end of 2022 and states simply that ""slow and steady wins the race."" On the other hand, Charles Silver of Permission.io is doubtful about the utility of ADA in the future. He estimates the value at $0.20, far below its present price of $0.49. Cardano's community-focused Twitter account, ADA Whale, says the predictions ""never cease to be hilarious"" given the ""soaring"" predictions the collapsed LUNA project was given before it collapsed. Terra's ecosystem collapsed in May following the Terra UST depegging. The original LUNA fully lost all of its value after a dramatic price decline, with billions of dollars in losses being reported. Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, then poked fun at Terra by suggesting buying some LUNA tokens for ""negative correlation,"" parroting a jab made by Do Kwon, Terraform Labs CEO. Hoskinson also defended ADA's recent underperformance by asserting that it tracked the other major cryptocurrencies that are in a bear market. ADA, the native token of Cardano is now trading at $0.49 after increasing by 8.93%. Ahead of the Alonzo hard fork in September 2021, Cardano reached its most recent all-time high of $3.10, which raises hopes for the impending Vasil hard fork to have similar price movement.",https://u.today/adas-short-term-price-predictions-leave-cardano-community-baffled-details,utoday,2022-07-18,13:32:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Bitcoin and Ethereum Lead Crypto Market Recovery, But It's Too Early to Celebrate: Crypto Market Review, July 18","Last weekend and the beginning of this week were pleasant surprises for cryptocurrency investors and traders as some altcoins are showing double digit gains, and the biggest cryptocurrencies on the market are rallying and reaching new  levels , but it might be too early to celebrate as massive risk factors still exist. The CPI data release in the United States is usually considered a stronger signal for investors, hence it has more impact on the cryptocurrency market. But the same data for the European Union might also affect the cryptocurrency market heavily, considering the percentage of traders on the  crypto market  in Europe. Additionally, the United Kingdom, Canada and Japan will all announce their June CPI. Since many developed countries are announcing inflation data, investors will see the real state of global financial  markets . Financial experts and analysts expect elevated inflation numbers similar to U.S. data or even higher, considering the European Central Bank's relative calmness compared to the reaction of the U.S. financial regulator, which remains hawkish. As we mentioned in our previous market review, the DXY rally is one of the main factors pushing the price of Bitcoin down and not letting it gain more momentum on the market in addition to the lack of inflows on the market. In the last two trading days, the U.S. dollar has lost more than 1% from its value and reached a one-week low. The main reason could be the desire of investors to protect themselves from the potentially soft reaction of the Fed to the inflation data we received earlier in the last week. DXY might also enter a ""cool-off"" retrace mode after rallying for the last 50 days against other currencies. The potential strengthening of monetary policy in the European Union will also cause a drop in the value of the U.S. dollar against the Euro. Despite the macro pressure that remains on the cryptocurrency market, altcoins like LDO, MATIC and Ethereum are showing strong performance on the cryptocurrency market. Ethereum investors gained more hope in the  network  after the revelation of the Merge update date. Following the release, Ethereum Classic, which positions itself as the ""true"" version of Ethereum, rallied by over 35%. Lido Finance governance token LDO also saw a massive gain as decentralized platforms remain among the biggest stakers in Ethereum 2.0, benefiting from the upcoming Ethereum update.",https://u.today/bitcoin-and-ethereum-lead-crypto-market-recovery-but-its-too-early-to-celebrate-crypto-market,utoday,2022-07-18,14:20:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Records Substantial DeFi Inflows Over 7-Day Period as Number of dApps Increases,"Data from  DefiLlama  shows that the Cardano DeFi ecosystem has drawn more capital, with a positive increase of 7.36% over the past 24 hours in its total value locked (TVL). Cardano's DeFi experienced inflows of roughly $21 million between July 13 and July 18. The total value locked (TVL) increased from around $109.55 million on July 13 to $128.31 million on July 18, which reflects this. Cardano's TVL currently stands at roughly $128.31 million, excluding the value of staked governance tokens. However, with staking included, its TVL is currently $155.35 million, and twelve dApps are contributing to this. This is an increase from the six dApps earlier in the year. Wingriders (WRT) has 35.36% dominance, with $54.94 million currently locked. MinSwap is in the second position, with $42.94 million locked up. SundaeSwap currently has a total value locked in of $24.59 million. The  Vasil  upgrade aims to deliver several crucial capabilities, which might allow the launch of additional projects while also significantly improving Cardano's performance. Additionally, it aims to provide existing dApps with an upgrade path that might increase speed, transactional capability and script power. To enhance network performance, IOG has already begun implementing several consistent parameter optimizations (such as an increase in block size and script memory units) in 2022. The Vasil hard fork, which includes Diffusion Pipelining, shifts things up a notch by accelerating block propagation times and enabling better throughput. Vasil hopes to further enhance the Plutus platform, enabling developers to produce dApps that are quicker and more effective. Plutus V2 capabilities will be accessible, starting with the epoch after the Vasil hard fork as the current Plutus V1 version is unable to use reference inputs, reference scripts or inline datums. The Vasil hard fork is tentatively scheduled for the last week in July.",https://u.today/cardano-records-substantial-defi-inflows-over-7-day-period-as-number-of-dapps-increases,utoday,2022-07-19,14:29:00,en

The founder of Cardano asserts that if both political systems are implemented on the same underlying blockchain, they may be interoperable with equivalent systems in other nations. Hoskinson also envisioned a day in the future where world governments collaborate and compete to be the most effective and beneficial, much like how Apple's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy quickly surpass one another.

On Monday, July 18, XRP managed to climb up to the sixth spot by  market capitalization  on CoinMarketCap, reaching $17.63 billion. This is an impressive milestone for the Ripple-affiliated token as it surpassed not only Binance USD but also its competitors Cardano, Solana and Dogecoin. XRP owes its taking the sixth spot to a more than 20% weekly increase in the token's price, 8% of which came from the current bullish momentum. The triggers for XRP price growth include Jed McCaleb's wallet emptying, the Ripple-SEC lawsuit gaining momentum and XRPL rapid development. In addition to this, XRP simply had nowhere else to fall. After the last capitulation in early June, XRP went into a long accumulation phase. With no reason to fall further, it rapidly surged upward as the overall crypto market rose. Researchers at finder.com recently conducted a poll, asking 53 fintech specialists to forecast the future price of  Cardano (ADA) . The results showed that the survey’s participants expect Cardano to end the year at $0.63. The panel was mostly bearish on Cardano in the short term, but predictions for those polled were divided. Matt Lobel, the creator of PLAYN, predicts that ADA might increase to $1.50 by the end of 2022, and Morpher CEO Martin Froehler agrees, adding, ""slow and steady wins the race."" However, Charles Silver of Permission.io is doubtful of ADA’s future utility. He estimates its value at $0.20, far below its present price of $0.49. At the moment of publication, ADA is trading at $0.50, up 3.02% over the past 24 hours. As reported by Money Control,  the Reserve Bank of India (RBI)  is planning to implement a cryptocurrency ban. However, according to Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in order to make such a ban efficient, the RBI would need global support. Due to the global nature of cryptocurrencies, it is important to avoid regulatory arbitrage. The Indian government has been struggling with cryptocurrency regulation for years, and it is yet to introduce a consultation paper that would bring clarity to the table. India’s long-anticipated crypto law was meant to be completed by May, but the industry is still in the dark. Meanwhile, some of the top Indian cryptocurrency companies are requesting more regulatory clarity. Opting for a stake in the company instead of XRP was ""probably"" a ""pretty big"" mistake, wrote  Ripple CTO  David Schwartz in his recent tweet. While Ripple founders Arthur Britto, Jed McCaleb and Chris Larsen together received 20 billion XRP, Schwartz took a 2% stake in the company instead of the token. The architect of XRP Ledger claims that he could have received around 500 million tokens. He also explained that there was no point in getting XRP from Ripple because he could simply buy the token on exchanges himself. At the moment of writing, XRP is changing hands at $0.36, down 89.27% from its record peak that was recorded back in early 2018.",https://u.today/xrp-beats-binance-usd-by-market-cap-indias-central-bank-plans-to-ban-crypto-ada-predicted-to-end,utoday,2022-07-19,16:36:00,en

With the integration, users will be able to seamlessly hold, exchange and convert tokens from these networks using the Trust Wallet. Integrating into a noncustodial wallet patronized by one of the largest crypto exchanges, Binance, seems like a good solution for all parties. Cardano has long established itself as an independent,  actively developing blockchain , which has also succeeded well in the NFT segment. At the same time, it seems that Cardano-based projects and their tokens have long been in the shadow of ADA, and supporting them in Trust Wallet could help them grow in recognition. The expansion of support for the Ronin network is equally great news, because the network was built directly for the needs of play-to-earn projects, and extending it beyond its own wallet should have a positive impact on the circulation of network tokens such as AXS and RON, actively used in the  Axie Infinity game . KuCoin also seems to be doing great, when no earlier than yesterday it became known that  the exchange reached the mark of 20 million registered users . This should encourage the project team to work more actively on its own KCC network, which is still mostly limited to KCS token. As for Trust Wallet itself, it is hard not to appreciate the scale of the announcement: three such popular chains in one day. The wallet's team is actively preparing for battle in the crypto wallets market. The main competitor here is certainly Metamask, whose token has been waiting for the cryptocurrency community for a long time.

cardano,No Section,Scaramucci Facing Investor Exodus Amid Crypto Crash,"SkyBridge Capital, an investment firm run by prominent American financier Anthony Scaramucci, is facing an investor exodus due to its poor performance mainly caused by low crypto prices, The New York Times  reports . 
 
The company is on track to lose about half of the funds it held by the end of June, which is roughly $890 million. 
 
However, a slew of the firm’s investors will not be able to withdraw their money. 
 
Earlier this week, SkyBridge Capital moved to suspend redemptions in one of its funds. 
 
SkyBridge also attempted to launch a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund, but its application got rejected in early 2021. Scaramucci predicted that the price of Bitcoin would go to $100,000 by the end of 2021. This, of course, wasn’t the case: the cryptocurrency peaked at $69,000 in November before entering a bearish cycle. 
 
In spite of the price collapse, Scaramucci says that he continues to believe in crypto, adding that blockchain is the future. At the same time, the financier admitted that he isn’t smart enough to time the market.      
 
The investor correctly predicted that the price of the flagship cryptocurrency would bottom out at the $18,000 level. Bitcoin dropped to the $17,600 level before buyers managed to step in.

In addition to Ethereum, assets like Cardano, XRP and LDO are also rallying and showing double-digit  gains . While Ethereum, Cardano and Solana are competing chains, the general growth of the decentralized technologies industry will bring more funds onto alternative chains, just as we saw in 2021 and the beginning of 2022. Cardano's release of smart contracts and the Vasil hard fork release is already a fundamental shift in the ecosystem of the project. If the rally on the cryptocurrency market remains intact, Cardano will be one of many beneficiaries of Ethereum's growth. Compared to ETH, ADA gained more than 25% in the last seven days, while the second biggest cryptocurrency on the market resulted in a 60% price spike. If the rally continues and ADA breaks the local resistance of the 50-day moving average, the next resistance for the coins would be the 200 EMA that stays 55% above the current price of $0.55. While Ethereum investors are capitalizing on the coin's gains, Solana is currently consolidating after a strong 40% rally. Such a rapid price spike has been mostly caused by technical reasons and returning interest in DeFi and dApps development  platforms . Despite the risks that Ethereum's proof-of-stake update brings to Solana, investors still believe that alternative L1 chains still have potential in the future and Ether's path to scalability and adoption is not yet finished. The main risk factors for Solana are the same: technical imperfection of the network, rising dominance of Ethereum and lack of inflows into the DeFi and NFT industries that acted as the main fuel for the growth of the network. Despite the criticism that XRP got in the last few days from U.S. senator and legendary trader Peter Brandt, the coin stays strong on the market despite the constant pressure it receives in a sharp downtrend. Since the local low, XRP gained more than 30% to its value and is now aiming at a bigger price increase following Ripple's success in court. Generally, the cryptocurrency market is staying strong and moving up continuously despite being in a downtrend for the last few months.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Sell the news? Cardano price risks 20% drop despite Vasil hard fork euphoria ,"Cardano ( ADA ) has dipped this July 21 as the market favors mounting selling pressure around its most reliable resistance levels in 2022 over a major upcoming hard fork. ADA price could plunge 20% by early August ADA's price fell 5% intraday to $0.476. The downside move came as a part of a broader retreat that started a day after it briefly climbed above its 50-day exponential moving average (50-day EMA; the red wave in the chart below) near $0.50. The 50-day EMA has been serving as ADA's curvy resistance level since October 2021.  ADA/USD daily price chart. Source: TradingView Additionally, the upper trendline resistance of a broader descending channel pattern strengthened the selling sentiment around the ADA's 50-day EMA wave. Earlier in June, the same resistance confluence had triggered a 35% price drop toward the channel's lower trendline. Therefore, ADA's renewed correction move risks leading the price toward $0.384 by July or early August, down about 20% from July 21's price. 2018 fractal suggests $0.20 per ADA However, a separate analysis sees ADA falling to deeper levels than $0.384. Penned by TradingShot, the bearish ADA forecast  draws  comparisons between the ongoing correction and the one witnessed during the 2018 market crash, as shown below. ADA/USD daily price chart 2022 versus 2018. Source: TradingView In detail, the 2018 chart above shows ADA undergoing multiple bearish rejections near its 50-day EMA (the orange wave) while trending downward in a descending channel pattern. The token's downtrend became exhausted after correcting by nearly 93% from its local high. ""Based on 1D RSI terms, we also seem to be on the third (3) and final leg below the collapse,"" TradingShot  wrote , adding: ""So if ADA holders want to avoid this, they need to see the price break above the 1D MA50 and sustain trading above it for a week at least. Otherwise, completing a -93% drop from the top is possible at around 0.200."" When hard fork? The latest ADA price correction appears in the days leading up to Cardano's hard fork. Dubbed "" Vasil,"" the hard fork  was supposed to go live in June but was delayed until the last week of July over  several outstanding bugs . Nonetheless, as of July 21, Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the firm behind the Cardano blockchain development, has not announced the exact launch date. Vasil is expected to bring significant performance and capability upgrades to the Cardano blockchain, including faster block creation and higher transaction speeds. From a fundamental perspective, the upgrade could boost ADA adoption due to improved network efficiency. But Cardano has a history of logging sharp price corrections after most network upgrades, suggesting a prevailing "" sell the news "" sentiment in the market. ADA/USD three-day price chart. Source: TradingView For instance,  the blockchain's Alonzo upgrade  in September 2021 partly prompted ADA to rise by over 200% to its record high of $3.16 before launch. But after the upgrade, the Cardano token fell by more than 85%.  ADA has risen by only 25% after bottoming out locally at $0.384 on May 10, suggesting that Vasil's impact on the market has been limited. But not everyone is convinced. For example, analyst Lark Davis believes the token will ""rip"" after the hard fork, given it manages to hold 50-day EMA as support.  #cardano   $ada  has broken past its 50 day EMA, now we just need Charles to announce the date of the Vasil hard fork and this puppy will rip!  pic.twitter.com/yQTiCiCE6H — Lark Davis (@TheCryptoLark)  July 20, 2022 Until then, ADA will likely stay under the ""sell the news"" pressure, pressured further by ongoing macro risks and their negative impact on crypto markets.

During its Wednesday earnings calls,  Tesla , leading e-car manufacturer, announced that it converted 75% of its Bitcoin holdings into fiat. According to the company’s Q2 report, at the end of the second quarter it held only roughly $218 million worth of crypto. Back in February 2021, Tesla purchased $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin, making its price spike to new highs. Shortly after that, the e-car maker sold a small portion of its holdings to test Bitcoin's liquidity. This February, Tesla reported that it had held roughly $1.99 billion worth of Bitcoin at the end of 2021. The flagship crypto dropped 6.13% on the news and is currently trading at $22,509, according to CoinMarketCap. Ethereum creator  Vitalik Buterin  has recently praised the Shiba Inu cryptocurrency while responding to a tweet about the winners of a fellowship in AI Existential Safety named after him. Buterin thanked the meme crypto’s community and wrote that their beloved coin made these fellowships possible. This tweet by ETH co-founder was well received by Shiba Inu enthusiasts: at the moment of publication, it scored more than 8,000 likes and close to 3,000 retweets. Last year, Buterin, who was unwillingly gifted half of the Shiba Inu supply by its creator, made headlines when he gave $1 billion worth of SHIB to a pandemic-focused relief fund. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  has asked the court  to revoke the amici curiae status granted to holders of the XRP cryptocurrency. Back in March 2021, a group of XRP holders led by attorney John Deaton filed a motion to intervene in the case. Despite the court rejecting their effort to intervene in the case in October, they succeeded in getting amici status. This made it possible for XRP holders to file “friends of the court” briefs. In May, Deaton asked the court to file an amicus brief regarding the opinions of Patrick B. Doody, the SEC’s expert. The SEC says that the movants’ proposed brief would simply “duplicate” the defendants’ efforts. Yesterday , Cardano, Dogecoin and Shiba Inu recorded significant gains, posting a 24-hour positive change of 10.78%, 14.77% and 12.26%, respectively. The three cryptocurrencies owe their growth to different factors. As reported by U.Today, Cardano's Input Output has become a new member of the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) Mongolia, which made ADA’s price rise. When it comes to Dogecoin, the meme crypto is also looking forward to the upcoming release of Dogecoin Core update 1.14.6. The update hopes to include important security updates and changes to network efficiency. Shiba Inu, in turn, anticipates its growth in an ever-increasing community, with a holder count presently at 1,209,427.

This sort of thing is Cardano’s secret sauce. It’s useful today, shows that the space’s focus on TPS is dumb 
 
But the flexibility and capacity displayed at the very base layer also shows why Cardano is such a big contender for running global financial infrastructure in future  https://t.co/ECmZrdHibb ADA Whale spoke in light of the new feature on Eternl Wallet that allows multi-address transactions. Cardano's light wallet,  Eternl  (formerly ccvaultio), introduced the new TxBuilder feature that allows users to add multiple outputs to a transaction and choose which UTxOs to spend. U.Today  reported last month that ADA could be sent to multiple addresses in one go as the Typhon wallet received an upgrade to support multi-address transactions. Users will now be able to send ADA or other supported tokens to multiple recipients in a single transaction, resulting in reduced transaction costs. On Cardano you can send Multiple Assets in a single transaction. That's means on Cardano you can send 100 Assets to different addresses in one single Transaction. This would take 100 separate Transactions on Ethereum or Solana and totally destroys any TPS argument.

Cardano is currently in the Basho phase — where it refuses to define scalability in terms of ""a million TPS."" According to  IOHK , it is logical to use TPS as a metric in the same context (for instance, to compare two Cardano node versions),  whereas ""using it as a means of comparison between blockchains isn't."" In light of this, IOHK emphasized the importance of considering and thinking about throughput, finality and concurrency as key metrics for scalability. Throughput is the amount of data processed in a given amount of time, whereas finality is the length of time the system takes to complete a transaction.

cardano,No Section,"Shiba Inu, Dogecoin Rallying with 50% Gains, Network Activity on Rise: Crypto Market Review, July 22","The lack of inflows on the cryptocurrency market and overall fear among investors did not prevent  memecurrencies  like Shiba Inu and Dogecoin from gaining around 40%-50% to its value in a matter of days. Such a strong gain is not tied to any fundamental changes in the project's future or events that would attract investors to those coins. U.Today has previously covered a massive rise in the activity of the Dogecoin network, followed by the strong price performance of the biggest memecoin on the market. The rising price and network activity were most likely consequences of the revitalization of Dogecoin whales. Since the market has not seen a rise in selling pressure, the rising activity of large whale addresses was tied to the increasing buying activities rather than the desire to sell their holdings. On Jule 20, Dogecoin saw a massive spike in  selling pressure  as the coin's price dropped massively from the local high, resulting in an 8% loss from the highest price point of the day. Thankfully, the memecurrency has not lost its value following Tesla's $900 million Bitcoin sale. Considering Musk's support for Dogecoin, some users became worried that the entrepreneur changed his opinion about the most famous memecurrency. Following the drop from the ATH, the portrait of an average Shiba Inu investor has changed drastically from a short-term trader who was willing to gain a quick and large profit from an extremely volatile trade to a mid-term investor who bet on the further adoption of the  cryptocurrency . The massive amount of retail Shiba Inu investors was the main reason behind every plunge of the dog-themed coin, considering that the majority of SHIB holders got it around the all-time high of $0.000088. As time went by, SHIB was adopted by numerous business and services that were more than ready to accept the memecurrency as payment despite its volatile nature. In the last month, Shiba Inu proved that it still has some potential for recovery as the memetoken gained over 50% to its value even without the support of institutional investors or big whales that used to actively purchase an insane amount of tokens back in March and April 2022. It is not yet clear if both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have enough growth potential for a reversal, but the cryptocurrency market successfully holds on under a pressure, with most altcoins not showing signs of a retrace, which means that both memecurrencies still have a chance to show us greater performance on the market.",https://u.today/shiba-inu-dogecoin-rallying-with-50-gains-network-activity-on-rise-crypto-market-review-july-22,utoday,2022-07-22,14:33:00,en

The organization's presence currently spans nine cities in Nigeria, the third largest country in Africa with a population of over 200 million people. By the end of the year, Afriguild also plans to expand into four more countries on the continent. In total, Afriguild aims to attract 100 million Africans into the crypto and web3 space. Cardano's intentions for Africa are  indeed serious , and the latest news adds to that impression. From the creation of Adaverse, whose activities are aimed solely at supporting African crypto start-ups, to Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson's personal trips to the continent and meetings on the tour with presidents of states, everything signals Cardano's ambitious plans to promote its technology in this part of the world that is underdeveloped in crypto terms but massive in human potential. Cardano's African connections are not limited to private companies. Last year, the blockchain's parent firm, IOHK, announced a partnership with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education, and  Hoskinson himself had  meetings with the presidents of Zanzibar and Burundi. If Cardano's presence in Africa continues to grow at this scale, there is no doubt that blockchain will gain  a strong position  on a continent of 1.5 billion people and secure a fair share of its crypto market.",https://u.today/this-is-how-cardano-plans-to-attract-100-million-africans-into-crypto,utoday,2022-07-22,15:22:00,en

It was stated that exchanges and SPOs (stake pool operators) needed at least four weeks for testing, which puts the last week of July as the tentative date for the Vasil mainnet launch. After the testnet hard fork announcement, work continued in earnest, starting with the initial node v.1.35.0. The IOG teams progressed to working on node v.1.35.1, which fixes an issue with the snapshot replay. Cardano testnet explorer and other dependencies also saw upgrades following the new node. Work also progressed on pipelining maintainability and the addition of tests for added confidence and regression prevention.  Currently, IOG reports in its  weekly  evaluation report that it is working on the upcoming release of node v.1.35.2.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's 25% Price Surge in One Week Mercilessly Liquidated ADA Bears,"According to the crypto analytics agency  Santiment , Cardano's ADA token price increase of 25% last week was accompanied by a large-scale liquidation of short positions. This is clearly visible on the chart, which directly shows the price of the token and the funding rate on exchanges. While the funding rate went below the price when it reversed, bears took the most pain when trading ADA. Judging by the Santiment chart, at the end of the week the ratio of liquidated long positions to liquidated short positions was 1-to-2. However, the number of successfully opened short positions prevails over the number of successfully opened longs. 📈  #Cardano 's price is back over $0.50, and up +25% the past ten days. Exchange funding rates are a vital metric to keep an eye on, as the extreme spikes in  #shorting  or  #longing  of  $ADA  is typically when traders get liquidated & big price shifts occur.  https://t.co/HV3hjdvTaU   pic.twitter.com/R80etteVnT In any case,  ADA managed to finish the week most positively , performing a 25% surge at one point. At the end of the week the token quotation grew by 15%, and its price managed to hold above the level of $0.5. Thanks to this result, Cardano overtook its competitors in the top CoinMarketCap by market capitalization and now ranks sixth there. With a capitalization of $17.7 billion, Cardano is ahead of such crypto projects as Binance USD (BUSD), XRP (XRP), Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE). Whether we should expect Cardano quotes to further go green is an open question and largely depends on the overall state of the crypto market.

As the Cardano blockchain explorer suggests, the network has been working smoothly for almost five years despite many periods of extremely high load; we saw one back in 2021 when the project released its own smart contract technology.  The smooth performance of the blockchain is most likely correlated with  Cardano  being one of the most actively developed chains in the whole industry, as the number of GitHub commits for the project reached 350 back in June.  Such high development activity is also tied to a lack of existing technologies and solutions on the network, which makes it an unplowed field for developers who bring their decentralized solutions from other networks to Cardano, which offers fast transaction processing and relatively low fees.  In addition to the low number of existing applications on the network, Cardano receives a massive number of updates in relatively short periods of time compared to networks like Solana or even Ethereum.  One of the most recent and important updates for Cardano was the Vasil hard fork that brought new features to the network and made the decentralized application onboarding process significantly easier.  With the fundamental upgrade, we shall see an  increase  in the number of new solutions and applications being deployed on the Cardano blockchain in the near future.  At press time, ADA trades at $0.5 and shows a 0.66% price increase in the last 24 hours.",https://u.today/cardano-reaches-new-milestone-1760-days-without-outages,utoday,2022-07-24,11:16:00,en

Unfortunately, ADA lost more than 8% of its value from the local high yesterday. The sell-off on Cardano was mostly caused by the general sentiment of the market that had a rough start after the opening of Asian markets. It is not yet clear what the fundamental reason is behind the strong plunge for  Cardano , but as we mentioned early, we saw a large spike in open interest on derivatives trading platforms, which might be the main source of the selling pressure. Open interest is not necessarily reflected in the number of longs on the market. Despite short-term fluctuations on the cryptocurrency market, Cardano remains one of the fundamentally strongest assets in the industry as it receives a number of updates and shows the highest development activity around it. Recently, U.Today covered how Cardano reached the new network stability milestone as it has shown almost 1,800 days of working without outages or other major issues with network stability. Unfortunately, the majority of altcoins are facing massive outflows and selling pressure as large cryptocurrencies like XRP lost around 9% from their local highs as fear returned to the cryptocurrency market. Last week, we saw a rally on numerous altcoins, including  Ethereum Classic , Cardano and AAVE. The main reason behind the positivity on the market could have been tied to the Ethereum Merge date reveal that attracted a certain amount of investors back into the market. This week, the cryptocurrency market might get shaky once again as we are going to see the results of an upcoming FOMC meeting and the earnings releases of numerous tech companies that might affect the cryptocurrency market and GDP data. All of those events might have a strong effect on Bitcoin as they have a direct effect on financial markets, which the crypto industry almost blindly follows for the last few months after entering a downtrend.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Hits New Milestone in Smart Contracts Creation: Details,"Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  has shared ""the first-ever Untyped Plutus Core Program entirely generated and serialized using only Typescript."" This new milestone might imply that developers might be able to write smart contracts on Cardano using TypeScript in the near future. Pretty cool  https://t.co/t7gUPSpJlf TypeScript  is a programming language created and maintained by Microsoft that is based on JavaScript. It is a rigorous superset of JavaScript in terms of syntax and gives the language optional static typing. It is made for the creation of large apps as it claims to provide better tooling at any scale. It means that one day developers will be able to write smart contracts on Cardano using Typescript. The Cardano blockchain was built using the Haskell functional programming language. Plutus, Cardano's programming language for smart contracts, and Marlowe, Cardano's domain-specific language for financial smart contracts, are both based on Haskell. Both off-chain and on-chain codes for Cardano are also written in Haskell. Haskell is not the best-known programming language, though; that distinction belongs to Python and Java. Cardano justifies its  decision  to use Haskell by pointing out that it is ideal to write code that is robust and correct, especially when combined with formal methods. According to  Michele Harmonic , the Plu-ts project aims to allow smart contracts and transaction creation using only TypeScript, enabling developers to create decentralized apps while maintaining the benefits of Cardano smart contracts. He explains that right now, only the Haskell programming language is used to generate smart contracts, which limits their potential for use in situations where they must be created instantly. The proposed Plu-ts would allow developers to write Cardano-related, on-chain and off-chain code entirely in TypeScript. Without the requirement for a server, it would be feasible to create smart contracts depending on user inputs.

cardano,No Section,"IOG Shares Vasil Hard Fork Progress, Anthony Scaramucci Admits His BTC Mistake, Cardano Hits New Uptime Milestone: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","The past weekend brought lots of significant updates to the crypto industry. Let’s dive deeper into the details with U.Today’s top four news stories. With only one week left until the tentative date for the Vasil mainnet launch, the  IOG team  has shared an update on the hard fork’s advances. The IOG team progressed to working on node v.1.35.1, which fixes an issue with snapshot replay. Cardano testnet explorer and other dependencies also saw upgrades following the new node. Work has also progressed on pipelining maintainability and the addition of tests for added confidence and regression prevention. Meanwhile, IOG is working on the upcoming release of node v.1.35.2, which aims to bring improvements and fix bugs found in the previous node versions during Vasil testing. SkyBridge founder  Anthony Scaramucci  has recently confessed to a CNBC host that, looking back, he believes that betting big on Bitcoin was a “mistake” from a short-term perspective. However, in the long term, Scaramucci remains bullish on the largest cryptocurrency, saying that in his opinion, the Fed could switch its policy stance by the end of the year. During a recent interview, the investor noted that there has been an “exponential” increase in the number of Bitcoins. It is hard for “Mooch” to believe that cryptocurrencies will not be part of the future. Cardano  celebrates another uptime milestone. Unlike networks that face outages every now and then, the blockchain has been working smoothly for almost five years (or 1,760 days), despite many periods of extremely high loads. Cardano owes its smooth performance to being one of the most actively developed chains in the whole industry, with the number of GitHub commits for the project reaching 350 back in June. Such high development activity is also tied to a lack of existing technologies and solutions on the network, which makes it an unplowed field for developers who bring their decentralized solutions from other networks to Cardano. According to Santiment, over the past week,  XRP token  has reached a few big milestones, with one of them being several primary active wallets beginning to move their coins. In addition to this, a few large dormant XRP wallets have also started shifting their XRP stashes. Meanwhile, WhaleAlert tracker spotted a total of 374.5 million XRP transferred on Thursday, July 21, with the largest chunk of crypto equaling 155,000,000 tokens. In this streak of transfers, FTX moved 63,501,812 coins to BitGo, and Bitstamp moved 46,075,670 XRP to the same destination. Also, major U.S. exchange Bittrex moved 60,000,000 and 50,000,000 to Bitstamp and Bitso, respectively. The aforementioned 150-million XRP transfer was conducted from Binance to Bittrex.",https://u.today/iog-shares-vasil-hard-fork-progress-anthony-scaramucci-admits-his-btc-mistake-cardano-hits-new,utoday,2022-07-25,16:07:00,en

cardano,No Section,"BTC Might Drop to $19,000 Again, ETH Fees Plunge Ahead of Merge Event, Cardano Reaches New Milestone: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today presents the top four news stories over the past day. Take a closer look at the world of crypto! Bitcoin  might face another plunge to $19,000. The main reason might lie in bears providing great selling pressure that BTC, to the great disappointment of all flagship crypto holders, struggles with. According to a chart shared by analyst Will Clemente on July 24, if BTC plunges below the $22,000 range for whatever reason, we will most likely see a drop back to the $19,000 zone. However, many traders and analysts hope that Bitcoin does not drop below the $22,000 threshold once again as there is an abundance of inflows to the market, which makes the future price bounce a real problem for the market. It is worth noting, though, that institutional inflows are still at a relatively low level, which speaks against Bitcoin's success on the market for the foreseeable future. Ethereum’s  seven-day average fee dropped to only 16.98477 Gwei, reaching the lowest level this year, per Dune Analytics blockchain data platform. Ethereum fees remain relatively low despite the fact that the price of the second biggest crypto rallied over the last month. On Sunday, Ether spiked to $1,664, the highest level since early June, before paring gains. The recent price surge happened just ahead of the long-awaited Merge upgrade, which will allow the network to transition to the PoS algorithm. However, the Merge will not reduce gas fees, even though Ethereum 2.0 will consume much less energy compared to the computation-intensive PoS iteration of the second largest cryptocurrency. Cardano  blockchain has reached another significant milestone; its founder Charles Hoskinson shared a post by  @MicheleHarmonic , which presented ""the first-ever Untyped Plutus Core Program entirely generated and serialized using only Typescript."" This means that in the near future, developers might be able to write smart contracts on Cardano using TypeScript, a programming language created and maintained by Microsoft that is based on JavaScript. It is a rigorous superset of JavaScript in terms of syntax and gives the language optional static typing. It is made for the creation of large apps as it claims to provide better tooling at any scale. With the Merge event inching closer and closer, crypto miners are seeking new income sources since one of the biggest blockchains in the industry will no longer be available for mining. According to Ethereum creator  Vitalik Buterin , Ethereum Classic could be one such option. In his recent speech, he stated that Ethereum Classic is ""totally a fine chain,"" and those users who ""like POW"" should consider migrating to it. Ethereum Classic is a hard fork of the Ethereum chain, which mostly mimics its main functions. It acts as a smart contract network that supports decentralized applications and solutions with the native ETC token.",https://u.today/btc-might-drop-to-19000-again-eth-fees-plunge-ahead-of-merge-event-cardano-reaches-new-milestone,utoday,2022-07-26,16:37:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano Celebrates More Than 1,000 Actively Developed Projects on Network","According to the  Essential Cardano  website that constantly tracks updates around the Cardano network and key metrics of the  blockchain , the number of actively developed applications in the ecosystem has reached 1,040, in addition to a variety of other stats that we are going to cover. The most notable statistics shown on Essential Cardano's infographic is the number of currently developed solutions and applications on Cardano and a spike in the number of Plutus scripts. Two metrics are strongly correlated, as developers are constantly using the smart contract  technology  to bring new functions to their applications. With the Vasil hard fork, it is possible to onboard dApps on Cardano and add brand new functions to them. Besides the large number of projects that are currently being  developed , developers launched almost 100 brand new projects on Cardano last week. This is a big milestone for the network that introduced smart contracts technology less than a year ago. The biggest rise in the ecosystem is tied to the number of NFT projects on Cardano that saw a massive increase of 6,304 new projects. Thanks to relatively low fees, fast transaction processing and a relatively uncrowded market, Cardano attracts more artists every day that create new collections and NFT-related projects. Cardano ‌remains one of the most actively developed networks in the whole cryptocurrency industry, with over 2,500 Github commits in the last week alone. Such a rich development process mainly affects Cardano's fundamental value, which, unfortunately, is not projected in ADA's market performance.",https://u.today/cardano-celebrates-more-than-1000-actively-developed-projects-on-network,utoday,2022-07-26,12:10:00,en

The prominent Bitcoin supporter referred to the appearance of Bitcoiner and CEO of Swan Bitcoin, Cory Klippsten, on Paul Barron's show, where Klippsten referred to blockchain as a marketing scam. The Swan Bitcoin CEO stated on the show that ""the only use case for blockchain so far that is of any value is as part of a system designed for Bitcoin."" He is an idiot. It's a recognized class of technology that solves real problems from voting to supply chain. Just because he's incapable of understanding why doesn't change reality anymore than not understanding radiation doesn't make it not exist The Cardano founder's voicing his disagreement described blockchain as ""a recognized class of technology that solves real problems from voting to supply chain."" Keiser, a well-known Bitcoin maximalist, is often critical of alternative cryptocurrencies, or ""altcoins."" As reported by  U.Today , the founder of Cardano, stated his belief in blockchain technology and its capacity to fundamentally transform government services all over the world and even make them interoperable. The blockchain can support this interconnected global community as we transition to a genuinely global society by enabling the secure transmission of data in a smooth and democratic manner, in which, as the Cardano creator says, ""No one actor will have complete control over critical things and resources."" In late June,  Hoskinson  spoke about the future of digital asset regulation before the House committee on agriculture, which is in charge of the CFTC. He extolled the positives of blockchain. This he did by giving examples of how blockchain technology is being used to address issues in the real world, such as those confronting the beef industry. There he mentioned several applications for blockchain technology, including enhancing the industry's end-to-end supply chain and traceability.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Network Expands Further with Djed Becoming Official Stablecoin of IOHK's RealFi Start-Up,"Overcollateralized algorithmic stablecoin Djed, developed by COTI and based on Cardano blockchain, has entered into a  new partnership  with RealFi start-up Thrift. As part of the partnership, Djed will become the official stablecoin of all Thrift projects, including a peer-to-peer platform, wallet, fiat off-ramp solution and Thrift protocol. We are happy to announce yet another Djed partnership, this time with  @FinanceThrift , to integrate  $DJED  into their suite of user focused RealFi products. 
 
Read more:  https://t.co/JEoEBh6YeB $COTI   pic.twitter.com/opeoHFHhQY As a RealFi start-up, Thrift is also directly related to Cardano, or rather the ecosystem's parent company, Input Output. It was from the IOHK incubator that Thrift emerged, subsequently evolving into a full-fledged DeFi and RealFi infrastructure in its own right, with all of its products tied up in a noncustodial Thrift Wallet. Commenting on the event, Josiah Odosu, founder of Thrift, noted that  Djed fits perfectly  into Thrift's infrastructure with its security, privacy and decentralization characteristics. The integration of the stablecoin into the start-up's products will ensure their reliability and help further the adoption of Cardano, especially in African countries, said Odosu. The founder of Thrift mentioned Cardano adoption in Africa for a reason, as it is one of the top blockchain's priorities at the moment. As recently as last Sunday, we  reported on the participation  of Cardano-based accelerator Adaverse in an investment round in an African crypto gaming startup, which could increase Cardano's potential user base by another 100 million people. It seems that IOHK and Charles Hoskinson have not stopped at just trips to the cradle of human civilization and are seriously counting on a big chunk of the African crypto market. Given the  tough competition in the States  and possible tightening of crypto regulation in Europe, Cardano's expansion into Africa seems like a pretty smart move.",https://u.today/cardano-network-expands-further-with-djed-becoming-official-stablecoin-of-iohks-realfi-start-up,utoday,2022-07-26,16:18:00,en

cardano,No Section,BREAKING: Bitcoin Surges to Intraday High After Fed Rate Hike,"The U.S. Federal Reserve  has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 75 basis points following a two-day meeting held by its officials, continuing its aggressive monetary tightening.      
 
Bitcoin is currently up 3.07% and trading at $22,087 on the Bitstamp exchange, reaching a new intraday high. The price of the world’s largest cryptocurrency dropped by more than 14% in the run-up to the Wednesday event.        The world’s most powerful central bank has now brought rates to a range of 2.25%-2.5%. 
 
As  reported by U.Today , expectations for a 100 basis point hike rose sharply higher earlier this month due to highly elevated consumer price index (CPI) data. 
 
It remains to be seen how far the Fed is willing to go in order to curb inflation. Further rate hikes will mostly depend on employment and inflation data.  ",https://u.today/breaking-bitcoin-surges-to-intraday-high-after-fed-rate-hike,utoday,2022-07-27,18:02:00,en
cardano,No Section,IMF Warns More Cryptocurrencies May Fail,"Tobias Adrian, director of monetary and capital markets for the International Monetary Fund (IMF), has warned in a recent interview with  Yahoo! Finance  that the cryptocurrency industry could potentially get worse. 
 
Adrian believes that more cryptocurrency projects could fail in the future. It is worth noting that the current cryptocurrency crisis was largely triggered by the downfall of the TerraUSD (UST) algorithmic stablecoin that took the whole ecosystem down. 
 
More vulnerable fiat-backed stablecoins are likely to see bank runs in the near future. He specifically mentioned  Tether , the leading stablecoin issuer, as an example of such projects. That said, Adrian acknowledged that there were certain stablecoins that were less vulnerable to such crises. The IMF director is convinced that digital assets will see an even steeper sell-off if the U.S. economy enters a recession. 
 
The central bank is widely expected to announce another massive rate hike later today in order to tame inflation. Speaking of regulation, Adrian believes that the focus is on bringing wallet providers and cryptocurrency exchanges into compliance since they serve as entry points for thousands of cryptocurrencies. At the same time, he admitted that regulating each individual token would be a herculean task given that there are tens of thousands of tokens in existence.",https://u.today/imf-warns-more-cryptocurrencies-may-fail,utoday,2022-07-27,15:37:00,en

Just as in another famous project, Sandbox, players here can buy land and in-game items that are NFTs or CNFTs, paying for them with PAVIA or ADA tokens. Since its launch, nearly 18,000 people have become owners of the virtual lands of the Pavia Metaverse, with a total turnover of more than 28 million ADA, according to the JPG Store. It seemed that with the  prolonged fall of the crypto market , the first thing investors would rush to get rid of would be the most profitable — that is, high-risk assets. As it turned out, the most affected sectors were  NFTs and Metaverses . The prospects of these markets have not gone anywhere, and those crypto gaming projects that are still afloat are likely to receive a generous share from such a promising market in the future. In turn, according to a recent analysis report from  Technavio , the Metaverse real estate market alone is able to grow by more than $5 billion over the next 3.5 years, and the main growth factor will be the popularity of mixed reality and crypto. At the same time, the inability to objectively assess the real value of properties in Metaverses is considered the main obstacle for the market. This makes sense because the largest Metaverses are built  based on Ethereum , where even gas fees significantly emptied investors' pockets and, therefore, the market tends to inflate. Add to that the crazy hype and greed of market participants, and you have the perfect bubble.

cardano,No Section,Here Is How Cardano-Based New Digital Economy Is Developing: Details,"Cardano  might be a big contender for running global financial infrastructure as it allows financial services to be built on top of the transactional network that can operate without an intermediary. There are DEXes running on Cardano that allow you to swap ADA, USDC, USDT, BTC, ETH, and other tokens. Everything is decentralized, and there's no need to trust a centralized third party with the private keys to your coins. All you need is a Cardano wallet to access all of Defi's  https://t.co/B9PjsYxBRf Cardano would enable this through a decentralized ID (DID) implemented through the Atala PRISM project. Lace, a lightweight wallet for Cardano, intends to integrate voting and identification in upcoming versions. Additionally, Lace plans to use many Cardano products, fusing a variety of functionalities into a unified user experience. This will incorporate Project Catalyst for simple voter registration and Atala PRISM for managing identities and personal data. The use of cryptocurrencies for making payments is expanding. It is unclear if these will be stablecoins or the native coins of specific projects. Cardano wants to have a big impact as it will enable the tokenization of the economy. Decentralized Identity (DID), which gives consumers more privacy control, might be a pillar of this future. Peer-to-peer payments will also become simpler since participants might be able to confirm with whom they are conversing. DeFi hopes to function fundamentally better thanks to DID, and existing financial services and enterprises will eventually incorporate these ideas. Dish, a Fortune 500 corporation, and a few African nations are beginning to employ DID. Last year,  Input Output  Global (IOG) announced its partnership with the Ethiopian Ministry of Education to provide five million Ethiopian students with a way to verify their academic credentials using Atala PRISM technology, built on Cardano.

cardano,No Section,Will Cardano Be Listed on Robinhood? Here's What Community Thinks,"Despite listing a handful of cryptocurrencies in recent months, Cardano users seem to be unhappy with trading app  Robinhood  not listing ADA on its platform. Earlier in July, Robinhood  announced  the listing of Uniswap's UNI token. In April, Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL) and Compound (COMP), alongside meme cryptocurrency Shiba Inu (SHIB), went live on the Robinhood platform. In late June, the trading app also listed Chainlink (LINK). As a result, to attract more consumers, Robinhood has grown noticeably less conservative when it comes to listing new tokens, as evidenced by the addition of the new cryptocurrencies during the past several months. The question now remains whether Robinhood will list Cardano. The responses to a Twitter thread started by a  Cardano user , ""Dean,"" who had called the attention of Robinhood and its CEO to list Cardano, varied. So  @RobinhoodApp   @vladtenev , since you’ve already listed SOL, MATIC, and even SHIB, when can we expect an ADA listing?  #Cardano User ""@Adriansweb"" says, ""Gotta be honest, but I really don't think Cardano needs or wants these companies. They can play in their own pool, we have the ocean to explore."" A response to this reads: ""I don’t really agree with that approach though. We should strive to be anywhere there are a ton of users, and that includes Robinhood."" Another  user , ""Real ADA whale,"" is optimistic about Cardano's listing on Robinhood: ""They can’t ignore ADA."" I think they will list Cardano soon!"" After going viral last year, Shiba Inu's petition for listing ended up being a huge success, gathering more than 500,000 signatures. Early in April this year, Robinhood introduced support for Shiba Inu after months of lingering.

Chipotle , American chain of fast-casual restaurants, found itself in the spotlight after posting a picture with a giant dog of the Shiba Inu breed on top of one of its restaurants. The picture appeared to be to the liking of the Dogecoin community, with plenty of DOGE supporters leaving comments under the picture and even calling the restaurant chain “Dogepotle.” The post may be attributed to a recent giveaway announcement made by the company; as  reported by U.Today , fans of the meme coin can win up to $3,000 in their favorite cryptocurrencies until Saturday. On Sunday, the size of the prize will be significantly increased, with $11,250 worth of DOGE up for grabs. Data provided by The TIE, a leading provider of informational services, shows that despite the upcoming Vasil hard fork,  Cardano  has seen a major drop in social media activity. Specifically, its popularity on Twitter has recently reached a six-month low, which has also coincided with a sharp decline in trading volumes. However, the ADA price managed to benefit from the long-awaited upgrade, rising roughly 10% on the news over the past week alone. Despite losing its luster on social media, Cardano continues to see strong developer activity. As  reported by U.Today , there are now more than 1,000 actively developed projects on the network. According to a Twitter post by James K. Filan, Judge Torres has denied the  SEC’s motion  to revoke the amici status of XRP holders. It is worth noting that, according to the ruling, the court will not benefit from movants’ assistance in evaluating the qualifications of experts picked by the regulatory agency. Back in October, John E. Deaton and other movants were allowed to act as friends of the court, but their attempt to insert themselves into the case as third-party defendants was rejected. As  reported by U.Today , the SEC asked the court to revoke XRP holders’ amici status last week after Deaton took aim at Patrick B. Doody, the SEC’s expert whose report detailed what information the XRP holders relied on before buying the token. The XRP network has added  yet another anomaly  to its list. Per Santiment’s on-chain analytics, on July 26, it witnessed  an outstanding number  of unique addresses interacting on the network. With 243,000 addresses, the XRP network broke the 2.5-year record set back in February 2020. Santiment also noted that the spike in activity occurred within a short period of four hours. This increase in activity, however, does not correlate with the price of XRP but rather occurred against a background of falling prices in recent days. Last Friday, the market also saw an enormous surge in XRP trading volumes. In the last hours of the day, the figure reached 18.6 million XRP, which is about 1,200% more than the standard figure.",https://u.today/doge-takes-over-chipotle-sec-fails-to-revoke-xrp-holders-amici-status-cardano-loses-popularity-on,utoday,2022-07-28,16:04:00,en

“I actually think now the industry is much healthier than it was six months, nine months ago…People who are building real applications are staying in the industry.”     
 
Zhao explains that crypto attracted a lot of non-believers into the space who are most likely just speculators. This shouldn’t have happened on a large scale, according to the Binance boss. Hence, the ongoing correction was inevitable. “Usually markets overswing in both ways,” Zhao added. 
 
The total cryptocurrency market cap peaked at nearly $3 trillion in early November, with Bitcoin soaring to as high as $69,000. However, this was followed by a brutal crash triggered by unfavorable macro conditions.

cardano, News , Cardano Vasil hard fork hit with another delay for several weeks ,"After failing to go live last month, the Cardano Vasil hard fork is delayed again as teams behind the Cardano blockchain development target a smooth network upgrade. Input Output Global (IOG), the organization responsible for Cardano’s research and development,  released  a YouTube update on Thursday on the upcoming Vasil hard fork. IOG technical manager Kevin Hammond announced that the Vasil hard fork will be postponed one more time to ensure that all parties, including exchanges and API developers, are “all ready for that.” Hammond said: “Obviously, from where we are, there could be a few more weeks before we go to the actual Vasil hard fork [...] This is incredibly important. All the users must be ready to progress through the hard fork to ensure a smooth process.” Hammond pointed out that IOG has been focused on solving some testnet issues,  progressing  with the Cardano node version 1.35.2. The new node version fixes issues related to stake pool operators,  decentralized application (DApp)  developers, internal testing and other issues identified on the testnet. “The goal is that it will flush out any final issues as we go to the Vasil hard fork. What we’re doing is fixing on testing authority, getting it right and not rushing,” Hammond added. Amid the expected update, Cardano’s ( ADA ) price has seen some significant volatility,  surging  more than 7% over the past 24 hours at the time of writing, trading at $0.537. The cryptocurrency has been up 21% over the past 14 days, according to data from CoinGecko. Cardano (ADA) 14-day price chart. Source: CoinGecko The Vasil hard fork is the biggest upgrade to Cardano since the  Alonzo hard fork , which was completed in September 2021. The upcoming fork is positioned as a “game changer” in the Cardano development, as it’s expected to improve the network in terms of speed and scalability, making it more suitable for smart contracts and DApps. Input Output  released  the roadmap for the Vasil hard fork in May 2022, originally aiming to execute the hard fork on the mainnet on June 29.

""There could be a few more weeks from where we are before we go to the actual Vasil hard fork,” Kevin Hammond, IOG technical manager, said  in a monthly update call  Thursday. Testing for “inevitable issues” was taking place and any problems were being fixed by the development team. “All users have to be ready to progress through the hard fork to make sure the smooth process, both for them and end users of the Cardano blockchain,” Hammond said. Vasil, an upgrade designed to increase Cardano's scaling capabilities, had been scheduled for a June release on a test network followed by its introduction on the main network. A hard fork is a backward-incompatible change to the software used to validate and produce new blocks. The team had earlier flagged seven bugs that prevented developers from releasing Vasil as planned in June. “This puts us behind schedule on our previously communicated target date of June 29 for a mainnet hard fork,”  they said at the time . The final decision to upgrade the Cardano testnet will be made in consultation with the network’s  decentralized application  (dapp) development community. Before that, developers must clear any critical issues in testing, conduct benchmarking tests and inform the broader developer community to allow enough time to test their dapps before the hard fork is implemented.

cardano,No Section,XRP & Cardano (ADA) Need This To Hold On to Conquered Places in Market Cap Top,"XRP and Cardano (ADA), two projects that are beloved by their communities, have managed to move further up in the CoinMarketCap top by market capitalization. After receiving  a boost of positivity  in recent weeks, both have moved up the ranks, and as of now XRP takes the 6th spot and Cardano the 7th. Capitalization estimates for XRP and Cardano have settled around $18 billion, with XRP outpacing its old ranking neighbor by $800 million. Binance USD, Solana (SOL) and Dogecoin (DOGE) remained behind in the top 10. Ahead of both projects is a wall of Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Tether (USDT), USD Coin (USDC) and BNB. The capitalization of these coins is at least three times that of XRP and Cardano, but there is a loophole that could allow both to move at least two places higher. It is clear that in order for XRP and  Cardano to continue to stay in the top  they need to grow and develop along with the crypto market. However, the battle for the top places is not so simple: the places in the top five, where XRP and Cardano aspire to get to, are occupied by USDT and USDC stablecoins. That's the catch.  With a capitalization of $66.2 billion and $54.45 billion, USDT and USDC became a full-fledged parking lot for those investors who decided to wait out the market turbulence in money, but not in fiat. When the market finally moves into the phase of active accumulation and further growth,  it may be expected that  some of the capitalization of stablecoins will cross into other projects, the strongest and closest to the top first of all. This thesis was also confirmed by Binance CEO and BUSD ""owner"" Changpeng Zhao in his latest tweet: 3 of the top 10 are stable coins, meaning there is a lot of ""fiat"" sitting sidelines, ready to get back in.

While that might seem baffling to newbies, ADA whale, a Cardano community-focused Twitter account, seems to know the reason for Cardano's seeming lack of acceptance by the larger crypto community, dominated largely by Bitcoin and Ethereum. Understand that Cardano is the third major crypto culture, will never be accepted by the first two (BTC and ETH) or by the latter's Solunavax spawn-offs. Searching for acceptance from them is a futile effort, we're here to build out our own version of what a crypto should be He says that ""Cardano remains a major crypto culture, aiming to build out its own version of what a crypto should be"".

In times past, Cardano faced significant criticism over its UTXO model, its systematic approach to implementation, and most recently, the slow pace of growth in  Cardano's DeFi ecosystem , as reflected in its TVL.

cardano,No Section,Here's Why Cardano DEXes Are Already on Next Level Compared to Ethereum,"The staking yield is one of the few risk-free tools for making a passive income in blockchain-related projects as Cardano offers making around 11% annually from staking ADA, and some  Cardano  community members believe that implementing it to the DEX should be the next priority for  developers .  By implementing the functions to Cardano-based decentralized exchange and decentralized finances, the platform would be a massive step toward the project's future. The implementation of a risk-free tool, like the staking yield, would attract more users from other chains to Cardano and form an image of the ecosystem in the right way.  Other protocols, including Ethereum, might not implement the same functions on their platform because of non-liquid stacking and other technical limitations. In order to get a similar experience on the second biggest network in the market, users would need to use third-party solutions, even decentralized ones.  With the volatile nature of Ethereum, some users risk losing their money because of the usage of widespread ETH-pegged tokens that claim to have a 1:1  exchange rate  with ETH but fail to maintain it due to the lack of  liquidity .  Unfortunately, the variety of new functions, the high development activity and the numerous benefits do not help ADA to perform better on the market as the coin is still failing to exit the sharp downtrend it entered back in 2021.  At press time, Cardano is changing hands at $0.52 and showing a mild 0.21% price increase in the last 24 hours. ",https://u.today/heres-why-cardano-dexes-are-already-on-next-level-compared-to-ethereum,utoday,2022-07-31,11:16:00,en

As we learned from the report, the second month of summer was marked by a record inflow of funds for 2022. In total, the cumulative inflow of funds to the crypto market in July amounted to $474 million. Nevertheless, such a strong inflow did not overlap with the largest outflow of funds in the amount of $481 million observed in the spring, and therefore the balance has not been restored. The last week of July also ended with a  positive  flow value, showing a plus of $81 million. Meanwhile, Bitcoin-oriented crypto products received $84.8 million; Ethereum-oriented crypto products saw inflows of $1.1 million. Also of note are Solana-based crypto products, which saw inflows greater than Ethereum's by $400,000 — $1.5 million. The rest of the  altcoins showed  insignificant fund flows. In general, July was a more  positive month  for the crypto market. The first green monthly candle since early April and closing above 200WMA are great signs for BTC. At the moment, the start of the new week is accompanied by a decline, which is generally not bad as we need to test the 200WMA for the $22,880 support.

Ethereum co-founder  Vitalik Buterin  has recently taken to Twitter to share his frustration about Bitcoin maximalists, asking his followers why BTC supporters tend to pick heroes that “turn out to be total clowns.” It all started with a video clip shared by Twitter user @DZack23, where MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor stated that securities laws have their basis in a set of biblical principles, such as “thou shall not lie, cheat or steal.” Therefore, he rejects the popular argument that securities laws are out-of-date and views ETH as inherently unethical. Buterin’s take on Saylor was not left unnoticed by the Ethereum community as it quickly hit back at the ardent Bitcoin supporter by recalling that he was accused of securities fraud by the SEC all the way back in 2000. Sunday’s post by  Shiba Inu’s  official Twitter account caused quite a stir within the community as the team behind the meme crypto shared a mysterious video with what appears to be the upcoming project. Opinion on what could be featured on the video are divided: some users claim that they saw the Ninja Turtles logo, while others suggested that it was a treasure chest. The teaser is most likely related to Shiba Inu’s much-hyped Metaverse project. As  reported by U.Today , the team recently partnered with The Third Floor (TTF), one of the world’s most prominent visualization studios, which has worked on a slew of Marvel blockbusters such as “Wonder Woman,” “Avengers: Infinity War” and others. Also, earlier this month, Shiba Inu’s lead developer, Shytoshi Kusama, also hinted at a new stablecoin that will be part of the meme coin’s ecosystem. Its rollout could potentially take place as early as 2022. After being postponed to take place in the last week of July, Cardano’s  Vasil hard fork  has been delayed once again. During the most recent Cardano 360 event, IOG's Technical Manager Kevin Hammond said that there could be a few more weeks of delays without stating a specific date for the release.

Back in late December 2021, it was reported that Shiba Inu holders were largely short and midterm holders (14% and 86%, respectively). Now, Shiba Inu holders are outnumbering short-term ones. This comes as crypto markets entered into a “bearish phase” or “crypto winter,” in which altcoins saw between 70%-80% of their present peaks wiped out.

The main reason is that the update needs more testing for a smoother launch. The news was the catalyst for the correction of ADA. Luckily, the Vasil delay is the only ‌negative event that has happened with Cardano for the last few months. The delay aside, the development activity on Cardano is still on a top level compared with other networks. Recently, Charles Hoskinson added, ""Sometimes you just have to let people build beautiful things regardless of how long it takes,"" most likely referring to Cardano's slow but steady development  process .",https://u.today/cardano-drops-below-05-heres-where-next-support-is,utoday,2022-08-02,10:04:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder Breaks Silence on Vasil Hard Fork, Gives Reason for Delays","Cardano creator  Charles Hoskinson  has broken his silence on the Vasil hard fork delay. In a live stream from his Colorado-based home, titled ""Some Brief Comments on Vasil,"" Hoskinson explains the reason for the delay: ""...the problem is that every time something is discovered, you have to fix it. But then you have to verify the fix and go back through the entire testing pipeline."" Some Brief Comments on Vasil  https://t.co/2ukWZZJoto He added, ""So you get to a situation where you feature complete. But then you have to test, and when you test, you may discover something, and then you have to repair that, and then you have to go back through the entire testing pipeline. So this is what causes release delays."" As reported by  U.Today , Kevin Hammond, IOG's technical manager, indicated during the most recent Cardano360 event that there might be a few more weeks of delay without providing a particular release date. He claims that doing this was critical to further testing and guaranteeing a smooth process. The much-anticipated Vasil mainnet hard fork had previously been tentatively expected to occur in the final week of July after IOG revealed a change in the timing toward the end of June. The Cardano testnet was hard forked to Vasil functionality on July 3 by the IOG developers. With the release of the initial node v.1.35.0, development continued after the testnet hard fork announcement. Due to the bugs discovered, the IOG teams moved on to working on nodes v.1.35.1 and v.1.35.2. The Cardano creator speaks of the new node v.1.35.3 as the likely candidate for the hard fork. ""The good news is that the set of things that could go wrong have gotten so small, and now we're kind of in the final stages of testing in that respect,"" Hoskinson said. ""So unless anything new is discovered, I don't anticipate that we'll have any further delays.""

cardano, News , Swiss Sygnum Bank expands crypto staking with Cardano ,"Cryptocurrency-friendly bank Sygnum Bank continues expanding its crypto services by launching support for Cardano ( ADA ) staking. Sygnum  announced  on Tuesday that the firm has expanded its bank-grade staking offering with Cardano, allowing clients to generate rewards by staking ADA via the bank’s institutional-grade platform. ADA joins Sygnum’s growing crypto-staking portfolio, which features three  proof-of-stake (PoS)  protocols; Internet Computer, Tezos and soon, Ethereum 2.0. According to the announcement, staking services make up an integral part of Sygnum’s platform and are available to clients through the bank’s eBanking platform. The services are fully integrated with Sygnum’s banking platform, which is designed to provide institutional-grade security by applying segregated wallets, secure private key management and other tools. Staking is the process of participating in the validation of transactions on a PoS blockchain in exchange for staking rewards. In contrast to proof-of-work (PoW) networks like Bitcoin, PoS blockchains do not need mining activity and instead rely on users locking up their coins to maintain a network. A major regulated bank in Switzerland, Sygnum debuted cryptocurrency staking about two years ago,  launching  Tezos staking in November 2020. Sygnum also announced in July 2021 that it would  offer Ethereum 2.0 staking  on its platform. The addition of Cardano staking on Sygnum will increase exposure to the digital asset to many institutional investors. Following a tenfold increase in gross revenues in 2021, Sygnum’s institutional client base was nearing 1,000 by early 2022, the firm  announced  in January. “This new offering allows Sygnum’s clients to participate in our ecosystem, where they enjoy a risk-free staking experience without having to transfer the asset nor lock it,” Cardano Foundation CEO Frederik Gregaard said. He added that Cardano’s architecture also provides both retail and institutional clients with a unique opportunity for ADA holders. “You always have the power over your ADA,” he noted. Related:  Ethereum staking service Lido announces layer-2 expansion Amid the upcoming Cardano Vasil hard fork, many crypto companies have been working on Cardano-focused services. In late July, major hardware wallet firm Ledger  announced  the integration of 100 Cardano tokens on its wallet software Ledger Live. The Cardano Vasil hard fork is expected to significantly improve the Cardano network in terms of speed and scalability, making it more suitable for smart contracts and decentralized applications. After  failing to go live in June , the Cardano Vasil hard fork  was delayed again in July . According to Input Output Global, proceeding with the actual fork might take another “few weeks.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/swiss-sygnum-bank-expands-crypto-staking-with-cardano,cointelegraph,2022-08-02,00:00:00,en

Yesterday, it became known that  MicroStrategy  co-founder Michael Saylor is stepping down as the company’s CEO. Saylor will assume the role of an executive chairman, moving his focus to the company's Bitcoin acquisition strategy and other initiatives related to the largest cryptocurrency. He believes that splitting the roles of CEO and chairman will make it possible for the company to pursue its core corporate strategies in a more efficient way. The position of CEO will now be taken by Phong Le, who has served as the company's president since July 2020. According to Le, he is ""honored"" and ""excited"" to become the new head of the organization. The shares of the company are down 2% in after-hours trading following the announcement. In its Thursday tweet,  Bitstamp  cryptocurrency exchange announced 14 new delistings. Among the most notable of them are XRP/PAX (Paxos Standard), BCH/GBP and LINK/ETH. It should be noted that a trading pair delisting is a permanent decision. The largest European cryptocurrency exchange did not specify exactly why it decided to end support for the aforementioned pairs. However, Bitstamp stated that it routinely reviews its trading pairs based on their performance and that its delisting decisions are also impacted by recent market developments. On Dec. 25, 2020, Bitstamp announced that it would halt XRP trading and deposits for U.S. customers after the SEC took Ripple to court. Later on, Coinbase, Binance.US and other big names followed suit, ditching the controversial token. The team behind the  Shiba Inu  cryptocurrency has recently revealed the name of the project’s much-anticipated game: it will be called “Shiba Eternity.” Users will be able to download the game from both Apple’s App Store and Google Play Store. Prior to the official announcement, Shiba Inu developers posted a teaser on the cryptocurrency’s official Twitter account, which caused quite a stir within the community that tried to guess what the mysterious video was attributed to. At the moment, Shiba Inu’s team of developers is working with PlaySide Studios, a video game developer located in Melbourne, Australia. Before joining forces with the Shiba Inu team, PlaySide had collaborated with such giants as Pixar and Disney. As recently reported by  Nomad , its cross-chain bridge has been hacked. “Samczsun,” a Paradigm researcher, described the hack as one of DeFi's most chaotic attacks to date. According to Peckshield, 41 addresses grabbed nearly $152 million in the Nomad bridge exploit, but the total amount lost is yet to be confirmed.

According to a recent tweet by @shib_superstore, the official Twitter account of Travis Johnson's gaming shop,  Amazon  has proved to be a successful SHIB burner on a daily basis. The Shib Super Store has been incinerating meme tokens via an Amazon affiliate program for a few months now, destroying from 426,621 to 4,212,299 SHIB per day. However, the value of these seemingly huge amounts of tokens is only $5 and $50, respectively. Hence, the maximum sum of SHIB that Amazon can destroy per month is 122,306,201 ($1,500). Overall, the SHIB burn rate does not look good for the token’s price: over the past week, only 0.0002% of the SHIB supply in circulation was burned (1.13 billion tokens worth $13,500). The founder of the Cardano blockchain,  Charles Hoskinson , has taken to Twitter to comment on Solana’s latest  multi-million-dollar hack  as the rivalry between the two blockchains continues. Hoskinson opined on the incident in his usual stinging manner by posting a GIF of Star Trek’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard doing a facepalm.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Receives Long-term Bullish Feature as 70.6% of Market Cap Is Staked,"CoinRank, an informational and statistical portal dedicated to cryptocurrencies, has prepared a  ranking  of the top 15 coins in staking by market capitalization. Cardano, the subject of this news, closes the top three. The Input Output project led by  Charles Hoskinson  has ADA tokens worth 70.6% of its market capitalization locked in staking, which amounts to $12.3 billion. First place, without surprise, went to Ethereum (ETH), with $21.3 billion out of the entire capitalization staked in anticipation of the blockchain's  transition to the PoS  consensus. Despite the upcoming upgrade to Ethereum 2.0, the percentage of coins blocked off to participate in the transition is only 10% of the market cap. Second place went to Solana (SOL), with 75.5% of capitalization, or $15.5 billion deposited in staking pools. In fact, there is no secret here for those who are ardent supporters of the IOHK and Hoskinson approach. Cardano's founder initially positioned the project as a PoS blockchain, and all of Cardano's long-term prospects were so obvious at first. The PoS model, in theory, is an ideal model for the  democratic structure  of a crypto project, where the impact of a minority with a large number of coins on the entire ecosystem is much lower than in PoW. This fact attracts more mid-level investors to a crypto project and this, in turn, increases the number of active users of the coin. In addition, the large share of ADA in staking indicates the desire of Cardano investors to profitably save the token. Given that this share is equal to 70.6% of the entire market capitalization of the project, we can say that this mechanism and the interest received suit them so much so that they are in no hurry to get rid of their ADA. In this way, staking provides ADA with solid support and strengthens the foundation of the token.

IOG reports the work done on node improvements by the Cardano teams and the subsequent release of a new node v.1.35.3-rc1 to support Vasil testing on the devnet. Every Friday, we publish our weekly  #Cardano  development update. So for the lowdown on what IOG's dev team has been working on last week, head on over and take a look👇  https://t.co/iVT0ZL1GhO Additionally, it states that a new dedicated preproduction environment has been spun up for the final stages of Vasil functionality testing. This new environment would provide improved chain density and a better developer experience and hence urged developers, SPOs and exchanges to use this environment rather than the main Cardano testnet. On July 3, the IOG team hard forked the Cardano testnet to include Vasil functionality. After the announcement of the testnet hard fork, development continued with the initial node v.1.35.0. The IOG teams then proceeded to work on nodes v.1.35.1 and v.1.35.2 after bugs were discovered. As reported by  U.Today , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, while making brief comments on Vasil, mentions the new node v.1.35.3 as the likely candidate for the hard fork. Hoskinson added that he ""doesn't anticipate any further delays unless anything new was uncovered."" The development of the Plutus contracts also continued ahead of the Vasil mainnet launch, which hopes to include three specific improvements to the Plutus v1 scripts: the Plutus evaluator speed improvements, updated cost model parameters, and datums and redeemers of other inputs. The Plutus team updated the Plutus tools to the node v.1.35.3-rc1 and the Plutus contract emulator to allow Babbage transactions over the week, according to IOG.

cardano, Opinion , What will the cryptocurrency market look like in 2027? Here are 5 predictions ,"The year is 2027. It’s a time of great innovation and technological advancement, but also a time of chaos. What will the crypto market look like in 2027? (For those unfamiliar, that's a  line  from the 2011 video game,  Deus Ex: Human Revolution.) Long-term predictions are notoriously difficult to make, but they are good thought experiments. One year is too short a period for fundamental changes, but five years is just enough for everything to change. Here are the most unexpected and outrageous events that could happen over the next five years. 1. The metaverse will not rise The  metaverse is a hot topic , but most people do not have even the slightest idea of what it actually comprises. The metaverse is a holistic virtual world that exists on an ongoing basis (without pauses or resets), works in real-time, accommodates any number of users, has its own economy, is created by the participants themselves, and is characterized by unprecedented interoperability. A variety of applications could (in theory) be integrated into the metaverse, including games, video-conferencing applications, services for issuing driver’s licenses — anything. This definition makes it clear the metaverse is not such a novel phenomenon. Games and social networks that include most of the features stated above have been around for quite some time. Granted, interoperability is a problem that needs to be addressed seriously. It would have been a very useful feature to be able to easily transfer digital assets between games — or a digital identity — without being tethered to a specific platform. But the metaverse will never be able to cater to every need. There is no reason to include some services in the metaverse at all. Some services will remain isolated due to the unwillingness of their operators to surrender control over them. The ""metaverse"" is going to happen but I don't think any of the existing corporate attempts to intentionally create the metaverse are going anywhere.  https://t.co/tVUfq4CWmP — vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin)  July 30, 2022 
 
 And there is also the technical aspect to take into account. The cyberpunk culture of the 1980s and 90s postulated that the metaverse meant total immersion. Such immersion is now conceived as possible only with the use of virtual reality glasses. VR hardware is getting better every year, but it’s not what we expected. VR remains a niche phenomenon even among hardcore gamers. The vast majority of ordinary people will never put on such glasses for the sake of calling their grandmother or selling some crypto on an exchange. True immersion requires a technological breakthrough like  smart contact lenses or Neuralink . It is highly unlikely those technologies will be widely used five years from now. 2. Wallets will become “super apps” An active  decentralized finance (DeFi)  user is forced to deal with dozens of protocols these days. Wallets, interfaces, exchanges, bridges, loan protocols — there are hundreds of them, and they are growing daily. Having to live with such an array of technologies is inconvenient even for advanced users. As for the prospects of mass adoption, such a state of affairs is all the more unacceptable. For the ordinary user, it is ideal when a maximum number of services can be accessed through a limited number of universal applications. The optimal choice is when they are integrated right into their wallet. Storing, exchanging, transferring to other networks, staking — why bother visiting dozens of different sites for accessing such services if all the necessary operations can be carried out using a single interface?  Users don’t care which exchange or bridge they use. They are only concerned about security, speed and low fees. A significant number of DeFi protocols will eventually turn into back-ends that cater to popular wallets and interfaces. 3. Bitcoin will become a unit of account on par with the U.S. dollar or Euro Money has three main roles — acting as a means of payment, as a store of value and as a unit of account. Many cryptocurrencies, primarily stablecoins, are used as a means of payment. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and — to a much lesser extent — Ether ( ETH ) are used as stores of value among cryptocurrencies. But the United States dollar remains the main unit of account in the world. Everything is valued in dollars, including Bitcoin. The real victory for sound money will be heralded when cryptocurrencies take over the role of a unit of account. Bitcoin is currently the main candidate for this role. Such a victory will signify a major mental shift. Wheat up 43% in the first 5 months this year Nat Gas 155% since Jan, +10% today Gasoline 96%  Let's see how long the ""consumer remains strong"" as this whittles away at what little savings they have left and as debt racks up Fight inflation w/ inflation, just print more lol  pic.twitter.com/b19becqa2x — Pentoshi  (@Pentosh1)  June 6, 2022 
 
 What needs to happen in the next five years to make this a possibility? A sharp drop in the confidence vested in the U.S. dollar and euro is a prerequisite for cryptocurrencies to take on the role of a basic unit of account. Western authorities have already done a lot to undermine said confidence by printing trillions of dollars in fiat money,  allowing abnormally high inflation to spiral , freezing hundreds of billions of a sovereign country’s reserves, and so on. This may be just the beginning. What if actual inflation becomes much worse than projected? What if the economic crisis is protracted? What if a new epidemic breaks out? What if the conflict in Ukraine spills into neighboring countries? All of these are feasible scenarios. Some are extreme, of course — but they are possible. 4. At least half of the top 50 cryptocurrencies will see their standing decline There is a high probability that the list of top cryptocurrencies will radically change. Outright zombies such as Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) will be ousted from the list, and projects that now seem to hold unshakable positions will not only be de-throned but may also vanish altogether. RELATED: 6 Questions for Lisa Fridman of Quadrata Some stablecoins will surely sink. New ones will take their place. Cardano ( ADA ) will slide down the list to officially become a living corpse. The project is moving agonizingly slowly. Developers not only fail to see this as problematic but even seem to view it as a benefit. 5. The crypto market will fragment along geographic lines Cryptocurrencies are global by default, but they are not invulnerable to the influence of individual states. The state always has an edge and an extra trick up its sleeve. A number of territories (the U.S., the European Union, China, India, Russia, etc.) have already introduced or are threatening to introduce strict regulation of cryptocurrencies. The factor of international competition is superimposed onto internal state motivations. When Russia was heavily sanctioned, some crypto projects started  restricting Russian users from accessing their services  or even blocking their funds. This scenario may play out again in the future with respect to China. Related:  Is there a way for the crypto sector to avoid Bitcoin’s halving-related bear markets?

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Responds to Critics Who Claim “Cardano Is Religion Without Tech” ,"Charles Hoskison, head of IOG, the company that built  Cardano  proof-of-stake blockchain, has taken to Twitter to respond to the critics who claim that Cardano misses the tech part, offering only religion to its community. They also claim that “big investors” do not even consider Cardano an investment option. In a recent episode of “Crypto Banter” podcast, several experts came together (founder of Messari Ryan Selkis, managing partner at Dragonfly Capital Haseeb Qureshi and Avichal Garg – a managing partner at Electric Capital, serial entrepreneur and an angel investor). The podcast was hosted by host CNBC crypto trader Ran NeuNer, who founded “Crypto Banter”. In the video extract published on Twitter by user @StakeWithPride Haseeb Qureshi stated that “all big smart money investors” do not think about Cardano. “They don’t spend time on it, they don’t investigate it”. Considering the question why these people allegedly do not think about the biggest proof-of-stake blockchain and its native token ADA, he then shared his belief that crypto is “a combination of technology and religion”. Any crypto has to have both, Qureshi claimed. “Cardano has religion without technology”, he claimed with the host agreeing with him. After that, Ran NeuNer shared that he believes that unlike Ethereum and Solana, Cardano and Charles Hoskinson have taken a slow approach to do build their blockchain in a profound and academic way with no rush and attention to every detail. Thus, “we are very early in the race”, he said. However, what concerns him about Cardano is that he does not see lots of development activity on this chain or a lot of venture capital money in it. He also stated that he does not see a lot of projects being built on Cardano. Cardano founder posted a sarcastic tweet in response to that video, saying that since Cardano only has religion without tech, all dev teams should pack their bags and he should probably also shut down all academic research centers and fire hundreds of IT engineers. So there you have it folks. We only got religion here. No tech. Pack up your bags. Let's buy some robes. Need some volunteers for pricing bulk kool-aid orders. We might as well shut down all those academic research centers and fire the hundreds of engineers while we are at it.  https://t.co/hMhpsAExBN As covered by U.Today earlier, shark and whale crypto addresses purchased a  staggering $138 million worth of ADA  in mid-June after the major price fall.

The motives behind the massive purchases are still unknown. However, the Cardano user is thinking that perhaps the purchases were made with the long term in mind or perhaps to profit in the short term after the Vasil hard fork. He wrote, ""Are these people buying for the long term or buying to dump on retail later after Vasil?"" The much anticipated Vasil Hard Fork remains one of the most significant updates for Cardano to date. This is because Vasil hopes to bring significant improvements to Cardano and its Plutus smart contracts. Cardano hit its current all-time high before its Alonzo hard fork, which brought about the capabilities of smart contracts. As a result, expectations for Cardano's price remain high ahead of the Vasil hard fork. As reported by U.Today, Cardano's founder highlighted the essence of timing as to the market’s performance when he responded to a user who complained about his $5,000 worth of ADA investment. The ""timing"" narrative may be one of the reasons for the enormous Cardano buying volumes that were recently spotted. Billionaire Mark Cuban recently made claims that Dogecoin has greater utility than Cardano when he stated in an interview, ""I still think Dogecoin has more applications available to it than Cardano."" Can’t really get mad about Cuban. Was a factually wrong statement meant to incite. He doesn’t have a great crypto track record, and his outlook on it is probably day and night to ours.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Blockchain Insights Hide Some Intriguing Stats,"True hardcore Cardano enthusiasts are probably familiar with the work of this community, immersed in the blockchain they love. But for those not yet familiar, we present Cardano Blockchain Insights from the Cardano Fans Stake Pool (CRFA). Here in one place, folks who care about the Input Output project have compiled some of the most detailed metrics describing blockchain activity like no other. While the full list of metrics and characteristics is presented  here , we will only review the most interesting indicators that assess both Cardano's performance and its success. First and foremost, we are interested in metrics detailing ADA staking,  given the recent news  of 70.6% of all token offerings deposited into staking pools. Blockchain insights confirms this fact, and according to the given charts, the percentage of staked ADA even exceeds CryptoRank data by 0.63%. In addition, ADA staking confidently holds the bar of activity. The total number of wallets staking ADA is fluctuating around 33.5%, which is about 1.2 million addresses involved in the process. However, at the moment, one can see a decreasing number of wallets delegated to staking pools and vice versa —  the growth of ADA wallets  holding coins outside the pools. The load on the Cardano network at the time of writing is estimated to be low, at 41.77%. At the same time, judging by the graph of the number of transactions/payments, we can say that this is the average ""temperature"" of the network load, which tends to explode from time to time with the increasing number of payments. To summarize, the detailed blockchain insights shed light on Cardano's day but cause mixed emotions. On the one hand, everything is so good that it is boring, and on the other hand, it is  perplexing  that such a stable blockchain has not found a scale commensurate with Solana, for example. It would be extremely interesting to see how Cardano's performance would have changed under a much larger workload.",https://u.today/cardano-blockchain-insights-hide-some-intriguing-stats,utoday,2022-08-08,15:38:00,en

Messari data shows that Cardano is behind Solana, Algorand, Tezos, and NEO when it comes to the number of daily transactions.

Cardano having greater transaction multiples and TVL multiples might mean, in a way, that Cardano was ""overvalued"" in Messari's context. Convinced that applying these sorts of traditional multiples - especially when based on inaccurate or flawed metrics - will mean that you continue to not get what drives value in crypto.

According to Coinbase’s orderbook,  Bitcoin  traders and investors are aiming at the $17,000 price range as the king crypto previously tested the lowest price in almost two years. The last time such a bid-side tilt in the orderbook was seen was back in March 2020, when Bitcoin hit its absolute lows after the bull run of 2017. However, Bitcoin and events around it have not shown any reasons as to why it is going to plunge back below $20,000. And rightly so:  as reported  by U.Today earlier today, Bitcoin surged to an intraday high of $24,010 on the Bitstamp exchange at 12:48 a.m. UTC. As stated in a recent report by Messari,  Cardano  is “priced more aggressively” in comparison to the blockchain’s adoption metrics. Messari data shows that in terms of the number of daily transactions, Cardano trails Solana, Algorand, Tezos and NEO. Cardano also has less total value locked (TVL) than Solana and Algorand, the report says. Messari further found that Solana overmatched its main rivals in major fundamental metrics, with its native token, SOL, priced “conservatively” compared to ADA and other peers. At the moment of publication, ADA is trading at $0.53, up almost 5% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. Yesterday,  BabyDoge  cryptocurrency surged 20% on a teaser of an important announcement published by the project's official Twitter account. Many BabyDoge holders hope that the announcement will concern the long-awaited inclusion of the coin in its listing on Binance. This has a good chance to happen, given that the head of Binance, Changpeng Zhao, once said that the main parameter for a cryptocurrency to be listed is the large number of people involved in trading it. With the BabyDoge holder count exceeding 1.6 million and the increased activity of Binance-affiliated media with regard to BabyDoge, this major announcement may be able to finally make the wishes of the BabyDoge army come true.

In addition to this, the average SHIB balance and value of this category of holders have increased by 26.58% and 24.18%, respectively. The spike in trading volumes was caused by increased activity as WhaleStats reports a 70% spike in active addresses with crypto whales interacting with billions of Shiba Inu.

In addition to the billionaire, the class action lawsuit, filed by the Moskowitz law firm, also calls Voyager CEO Steven Ehrlich to account. Recall that crypto broker Voyager was  on the verge of collapse  after hedge fund Three Arrows Capital, which had a significant share of the broker's funds, went bankrupt.

TVL DISCUSSION ON NOMAD IMPACT 
 
It has been a week since the Nomad event, which also has an impact towards our ecosystem. Let’s review the events and how they affect the  @Cardano  ecosystem.

Milkomeda C1, an EVM side chain launched in late March, enables Ethereum dApps to be deployed in the Cardano ecosystem. The cross-chain protocol, Nomad, is one of the multiple bridges deployed to Milkomeda. The consequences of the hack did not go unnoticed in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem, as the WingRiders DEX suffered a collapse in its TVL, pulling down the total value locked in the Cardano DeFi ecosystem as a whole. Before this time, the WingRiders had the largest share of dominance in Cardano's TVL, controlling more than 35%. The total value locked (TVL) is the number of user funds deposited into the DeFi protocols. On Aug. 2, when the news of the Nomad hack surfaced online, WingRiders' TVL collapsed by nearly 60%, while Cardano's TVL plunged from a $135.39 million record at the start of August to $89.29 million per DefiLlama data. The post-mortem analysis provided by the Cardano daily Twitter account gives the reason for the massive drop in the TVL of the WingRiders DEX as that it was the destination of wrapped assets from Nomad to Milkomeda. The WingRiders smart contracts, however, have no known vulnerabilities, and other DEXes continue to function properly. The WingRiders TVL, on the other hand, is down by 57.70% on a monthly basis because there is no longer any asset on Nomad, and the wrapped asset of Nomad has lost value. At the time of publication, Cardano's TVL was demonstrating a 24-hour increase of 6.27% at $98.58 million. With the inclusion of staking, the TVL was higher at $124.71 million.

First of all, 75% of mainnet blocks have to be created by the final Vasil node candidate. Developers recently released Cardano node version 1.35.3 for use on the Vasil dev net.

As reported by U.Today, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, while making brief comments on Vasil, mentioned the new node v.1.35.3 as the likely candidate for the hard fork. Hoskinson also added that he ""doesn't anticipate any further delays unless anything new is discovered."" cardano-node 1.35.3:  https://t.co/LukLCdnDml 
 
Cardano Node 1.35.3 
Released by LaurenceIO - input-output-hk #Cardano   $ADA As stated in the developer notes: ""Node 1.35.3 fixes some important issues with previous versions of the node and provides some CLI enhancements. The node provides full Vasil-era capabilities."" It was also noted that ""None of the (known) issues were considered to be blockers for the mainnet hard fork as they would be addressed in future releases."" The IOG team hard forked the Cardano testnet to Vasil functionality on July 3. After the announcement of the testnet hard fork, development progressed with the initial node v.1.35.0. The IOG teams then moved on to work on nodes v.1.35.1 and v.1.35.2 after bugs were found. In late July, during the Cardano 360 event, Kevin Hammond, IOG's technical manager, stated there could be a few more  weeks of delay  without stating a specific date for the release. This, he says, was necessary for further testing and ensuring a smooth process. The much- anticipated  Vasil hard fork remains one of the most significant updates for Cardano to date. This is because Vasil hopes to bring significant improvements to Cardano and its Plutus smart contracts.

Taken from the prior day's lows of $0.52, ADA has gained nearly 10% after the news of a significant milestone reached on Vasil testing surfaced. At the time of publication, ADA was up 6% at $0.55. Three critical mass indicators will determine when we trigger the mainnet update: 
 
1⃣ 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the final  #Vasil  node candidate 
2⃣roughly 25 exchanges upgraded representing c. 80% of liquidity 
🧵6/9 According to IOG, the Vasil upgrade remains the most ambitious program of work it has undertaken, so safety and security are its top priorities when managing the upgrade. In keeping with this, it states that a new node version — 1.35.3 — has been released for use on the Vasil devnet and the new preproduction environment. It says that if there aren't any major new problems, the new node might be the one with which the Vasil upgrade on the mainnet will be triggered. Additionally, the new preproduction environment has been created to give exchanges and SPOs a ""clean"" and more agile environment to test against 1.35.3 to begin their final testing and integration processes. It provides three critical mass indicators that will help decide when the Vasil mainnet upgrade may be triggered in a series of tweets: First, the final Vasil node candidate must have created 75% of the mainnet blocks. Also, key Cardano mainnet dApps (including the top ten by TVL) must indicate they have upgraded to 1.35.3 in the preproduction environment, and the mainnet follows after about 25 exchanges have upgraded. In its  weekly report , IOG reports ongoing work by the Daedalus team in preparation for the upcoming testnet release of Daedalus v.4.12.1. The Daedalus wallet is a full-node desktop wallet for the ADA currency. IOG also shared the latest statistics on the Cardano network in its weekly development report. Currently, 1,065 projects are building on Cardano, while 93 projects have recently been launched on Cardano. Cardano native tokens stand at 5.7 million, while Plutus scripts are now at 3,057.

As reported by  U.Today , Charles Hoskinson responded to doubters who said that Cardano misses the tech aspect and offers its community only religion. In reaction to these claims, the Cardano creator said that since Cardano only has religion without tech, all dev teams should pack their bags, and he should probably also shut down all academic research centers and fire hundreds of IT engineers.

cardano,No Section,Cardano: David Gokhshtein Explains Cardano's Only Problem and Reveals His Holdings in ADA,"Popular crypto influencer David Gokhshtein recently  shared  his thoughts on the Cardano blockchain and also revealed whether he keeps ADA in his investment portfolio. So, first of all, the founder of Gokhshtein Media said that he held his ADA position and appears to be pleased with the result, noting that since the purchases were made, this share of his portfolio has been growing successfully. As for his thoughts on Cardano, the crypto media figure repeated  the point  he made earlier. According to Gokhshtein, the main and perhaps only problem with blockchain is the complicated entry threshold and the need for more in-depth study, which seems too difficult for the average user. I’ve held  $ADA , but as the weeks have moved on it’s grown on it. 
 
Again, the only problem I have is that it takes a while to understand the ecosystem, which might push away people from building on it. Considering that cryptocurrencies and blockchain are indeed alien science for ordinary citizens who are not techno geeks, cypherpunks or ordinary crypto enthusiasts, Gokhshtein repeatedly complained about the  complexity  of Cardano branding. According to the influencer, simplifying the message and breaking down the platform in layman's terms would, if not increase the number of Cardano users, at least contribute to the growth of interest in it. Last weekend ended more than well for the cryptocurrency Cardano (ADA). The coin managed to come up to the upper limit of the price range of $0.4-$0.6, where it fell at the beginning of the cryptogeddon in May. Over the two days of the weekend, ADA showed excellent growth of more than 10%, but the important resistance level was not broken and the quotes corrected down from that level. In anticipation of the  further movement  of the crypto market, it is better to be guided by price levels. Thus, it is better to wait for another attempt to conquer $0.6 and then make your own investment decisions.",https://u.today/cardano-david-gokhshtein-explains-cardanos-only-problem-and-reveals-his-holdings-in-ada,utoday,2022-08-15,10:11:00,en

Cardano updates, a Twitter account devoted to news related to the blockchain’s development, has shared the Github data of the  Cardano  node 1.35.3 release. While commenting on Vasil, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson mentioned that the node may become a likely candidate for the hard fork. He also added that he ""doesn't anticipate any further delays unless anything new is discovered."" According to the developer notes, node 1.35.3 fixes some important issues with previous versions of the node and provides full Vasil-era capabilities. The Vasil hard fork remains one of the most significant updates for Cardano to date as it aims to bring significant improvements to Cardano and its Plutus smart contracts. According to an official announcement,  BlueBit.io , a St. Vincent and Grenadines-based crypto exchange that entered the market this spring, has added support for Shiba Inu. In a  tweet  devoted to the news, the team behind the exchange asked SHIB’s lead developer Shytoshi Kusama whether he wants to see BONE token listed on BlueBit.io as well. To the great delight of the Shib army, Kusama replied that it would be a great idea. Earlier this year, the canine coin was added to several other major exchanges. In early April, it was listed by Robinhood, then  Bitstamp did likewise  in June. Bitcoin  could still drop below the $10,000 level due to forced selling, said Euro Pacific Capital CEO Peter Schiff in a recent interview with Kitco. In Schiff’s opinion, the king crypto topped at the $69,000 level last November and is not going to reach a new high. The gold bug also called Bitcoin’s recent rally a “sucker’s rally,” telling Kitco’s anchor that the upturning of the crypto market is not sustainable. According to Schiff, the supply of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, and there is little difference between Bitcoin and the other 20,000 tokens. However, one should take Schiff’s prediction with a pinch of salt as many of these predictions failed to come true. Back in August 2019, he forecasted that the price of Bitcoin would never reach $50,000. Travis Johnson, game dev and owner of @shib_superstore Twitter account,  has shared  that  in August he expects to burn more SHIB tokens than in July. During the previous month, only $1,000 worth of Shiba Inu was burned. In comparison, by Aug. 13, Travis is “just about the halfway point of last month.” Johnson also shared that at the moment, the total amount of SHIB tokens burned by SHIB SuperStore equals 4,734,648,653. The fiat value of the aforementioned amount has surpassed $60,000. A week ago, Johnson tweeted that he knows how to easily remove  1.3 billion SHIB  from circulation on a daily basis, saying that it could be achieved with the help of the games for mobile phones offered by his online shop.",https://u.today/cardano-hits-important-milestone-in-vasil-testing-shib-listed-by-yet-another-exchange-peter-schiff,utoday,2022-08-15,15:57:00,en

Happy 1yr anniversary of being wrong YET again."" The founder of Galaxy Digital Holdings was a known big backer of Terraform Labs, the company behind the failed Terra and Luna. According to Novogratz, Galaxy Digital made its initial Terraform Labs investment in the fourth quarter of 2020. Consequently, he touted his relationship with Terra founder Do Kwon while disclosing support for the Terra ecosystem's tokens, LUNA and UST, on social media platforms. In January, he proudly displayed a new tattoo on Twitter: the word ""Luna"" and a wolf howling at the moon as the old LUNA crossed the $100 mark. However, the pleasure of getting the tattoo was fleeting as the Terra ecosystem collapsed in May after the UST depegging event. The co-founder of Terra, Do Kwon, made attempts to revive the network with the launch of Terra 2.0 and renaming the abandoned tokens Terra Classic and Luna Classic, respectively. But investors have yet to see any appreciable results so far from these efforts. Following Terra's demise, Mike Novogratz referred to it as a ""big idea that failed"" in a subsequent speech, while he also faced significant backlash over his Luna tattoo.

As the intelligence platform suggests, the sentiment around the cryptocurrency is rather positive at the moment, with the price of ADA gaining 22% in the past three weeks, following the general trend on the crypto market. With the rapid price increase of the coin, more traders and investors took profits off the current rally, which might not be beneficial for the potential continuation of the rally as Cardano desperately needs trading volume and new  inflows . The ratio between profit taking and selling at a loss is currently at a level we have not seen in the last three months, so the network has not been as profitable since March. Cardano is notorious for its extremely low profitability caused by the large volume of entries into the coin at around the ATH back in September 2021, when the project just released its own smart contracts technology. With most investors of the coin entering the market at the highest value possible, any move down puts a high percentage of investors at a loss, which causes issues with profitability and a low inflow rate in the future. According to the last available data, Cardano's profitability back in March was getting closer to 11%. Mainstream intelligence platforms did not disclose the profitability of the asset when it plunged to $0.4 in July.

The rationale for integrating with Rosetta is that all blockchains that have adopted an interface can communicate with it via a single interface without any issues. For instance, this is especially helpful for exchanges since they can interact with the Cardano chain using the same interface that they might already be using to interact with other chains. The latest release is crucial since IOG notes that one of the indicators that would trigger the mainnet update is that at least 25 exchanges are being upgraded. https://t.co/mKfNskaFXG   pic.twitter.com/wFTQMtuo50 In the past week, IOG reported that a  new node version  — 1.35.3 — has been released for use on the Vasil devnet and the new preproduction environment.

cardano,No Section,Cardano's IOG Reveals Game-Changing Innovation for PoW Blockchains,"Cardano's IOG has  unveiled  Ofelimos, a new PoUW-based blockchain protocol whose consensus mechanism simultaneously realizes a decentralized optimization-problem solver. Presently, there are two well-known consensus mechanisms: proof of work (POW) and proof of stake (POS). Proof of work is done by miners who compete to create new blocks full of processed transactions, and it is energy intensive. Proof of stake, on the other hand, is done by validators who stake to participate in the system. Cardano uses the proof-of-stake consensus. Bitcoin has seen harsh criticism from climate activists and environmentalists for the amount of energy that its network needs to operate. As reported by  U.Today , veteran trader Peter Brandt criticized Bitcoin's energy consumption, stating that the cryptocurrency was ""useless without an exorbitant use of energy."" Thus, the reduction of proof of work's (PoW) energy cost and carbon footprint is one of the most discussed topics in the crypto space. Substituting the PoW primitive in Nakamoto's longest-chain protocol with proof of useful work (PoUW) has long been postulated as an ideal solution in many respects but, to this day, the concept has lacked a convincingly secure realization. Proof of useful work as proposed by IOG addresses the problem of energy efficiency by repurposing the computational effort required to maintain protocol security to solve complex real-world problems. In general, the POW network is kept secure by the fact that 51% of the network's computing power might be needed to defraud the chain. Let's try this again. If you're an SPO, then please start the upgrade path. 1.35.3 is heavily tested, and it's more likely than not going to be the version for the HFC. Run through preview -> Devnet -> Pre-Production -> Mainnet:  pic.twitter.com/9VDtRPKTTY According to Cardano creator  Charles Hoskinson , the recently released Vasil node 1.35.3 remains ""heavily tested"" and may more likely be a suitable candidate for the Vasil mainnet hard fork. On July 3, IOG announced that the Cardano testnet had been hard forked to Vasil functionality. The team then proceeded to work on the initial node version 1.35.0, and then 1.35.1 and 1.35.2 after bugs were discovered. In the past week, IOG launched a new node version, 1.35.3, and said it might trigger the mainnet hard fork with it if there are no significant new issues. The Cardano developer also noted the Vasil upgrade remained the most ambitious program of work it had undertaken, so safety and security were its top priorities when managing the upgrade.",https://u.today/cardanos-iog-reveals-game-changing-innovation-for-pow-blockchains,utoday,2022-08-18,15:32:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Prominent Cardano Developer Says Testnet Is ""Catastrophically Broken""","In a recent  Twitter thread , Adam Dean, one of the most prominent Cardano developers, has warned that the blockchain’s testnet is “catastrophically” broken due to a recently discovered bug. 
 
Version 1.35.2, which was supposed to be used for the upcoming Vasil hard fork, contained a critical bug that was discovered because stake pool operators rushed to upgrade on the mainnet, and it led to the creation of incompatible forks. 
 
Even though the vulnerability has been discovered, the testnet remains broken due to the fact the lion’s share of SPOs upgrading their nodes to version 1.35.2 in order to simulate a  Vasil  hard fork combinator event.
Version 1.35.3, which was introduced earlier this week, is not capable of syncing the chain, and it is now being tested on two new testnets that do not have any block history. Dean adds that it would be an “understatement” to say the seemingly rushed rollout gives him an “uneasy feeling.” 
 
He has urged Input Output and CEO  Charles Hoskinson  to deploy the tooling that would be needed for a disaster recovery plan. 
 
The upgrade, which was originally scheduled for late June, has now been postponed several times due to technical difficulties.   
 
As  reported by U.Today , roughly 14% of SPOs have so far upgraded to node version 1.35.3, which is way below the required 75% threshold. On Wednesday, Hoskinson asked SPOs to upgrade their nodes to the latest version.

The reason is most likely a technical issue on the network. At press time, ADA has returned to the level of July 26, trading at around $0.46 per coin and losing over 10% of its value in the last 24 hours. Such a strong drop makes Cardano highly unattractive from a technical analysis standpoint as the coin fell below the local uptrend support and is now reaching toward the local bottom. In addition to falling below the uptrend line, ADA lost its foothold above the 50-day moving average, which means that the coin will continue moving in a downturn that began back in September 2021. As U.Today has covered  previously , Cardano testnet is ""catastrophically"" broken as Adam Dean noticed in his Twitter thread. The main reason behind the issue is a bug in Cardano node v.1.35.2. It has been said by Cardano developers that the new version is ready for the Vasil hard fork and has been successfully tested. The developer stated that operators have rushed to implement the upgrade on the mainnet while it was creating incompatible forks and caused a decrease in chain density. Despite spotting the bug, the testnet remains broken as the majority of operators upgraded to the broken node to simulate Vasil hard fork.

According to the crypto entrepreneur, the noise around the fact that someone is supposedly rushing stake pool operators (SPO) to upgrade to the next version of testnet is bizarre. The code has been tested numerous times, including by the SPOs themselves, says Hoskinson. Moreover, the part of the code that  provoked the ""catastrophic error"" has been removed. In accordance with the Cardano founder, the community could still postpone the launch of Vasil hard fork and start testing again, which has already been done a huge number of times, but would hardly benefit those developers of decentralized applications on Cardano, who have been waiting for an upgrade for almost a year. Concluding his speech, Hoskinson said that ultimately the final decision is up to the SPO, since  Cardano is a decentralized blockchain . Hoskinson's response was not greeted very well by some concerned Cardano enthusiasts.  Answering  their questions, the Cardano founder once again urged people to update their nodes to version 1.35.3 in any case, also arguing that the ""slowdown"" by the SPO hurts developers.

cardano,Opinion,Will Taylor Swift Ever Issue a Music NFT?,"I’ve always wondered what would’ve happened had Taylor Swift’s first re-recorded album, “Fearless (Taylor's Version),'' been released as a non-fungible token (NFT). If you’re unfamiliar, in 2019, preeminent pop-country musician Taylor Swift declared war against record executive Scooter Braun. He was withholding the masters (i.e., original recordings of her songs) of her first six studio albums, so she fought back by re-recording her own songs. Aziz Alangari is a marketing associate at Wachsman, a PR firm. She first re-published her second studio album, “Fearless,” through her record company and asked fans to listen again on streaming platforms. The move was a way to declare her independence from Braun – and as an artist. This is a classic tale of the power imbalance in the music industry, and goes far in explaining the most talked about use case for music NFTs: connecting fans and artists. With crypto, middlemen like Braun have much less power over artists like Swift from the start. NFTs are like signatures for digital media, etched onto a blockchain. They’re a way to conclusively show who owns what online, and also give a unique digital identity to infinitely reproducible files. “Taylor’s Version” is more or less identical to Braun’s original, except for its purpose. Swift urged fans to rebuy or stream music they may have already owned, because she was waging war against an exploitative music industry under the veneer of being personally victimized by Braun. And it worked. “Taylor’s Version,” according to  Billboard , earned more ""album units"" in its first week of release than Braun’s version had in total that year. It became the first re-recorded album to ever reach number one on the Billboard 200 chart. Swift, like many modern-day celebrities, has a lot of influence over her fans. Her ability to sell albums and successfully advertise products has made her a multi-millionaire. But now, decades into the social media age, there’s a growing realization that the relationship between celebrities and followers is  parasocial  and possibly exploitative. NFTs stand as a key way to level the playing field between fans and artists. They enable people to directly finance artistic production, as well as share in the wealth generated whenever an album is streamed or purchased. When she announced “Red (Taylor’s Version),” Taylor mentioned in a  tweet  that “Red is about to be mine again, but it has always been ours.” Has it, though? See also:  The Financialization of Fandom  | Opinion Swifties, who streamed the 10-minute version of her hit “All Too Well” non-stop, earned absolutely nothing. I was one of them. To call a spade a spade, there’s some overlap between Swifties and  TSA  dogs: They all know they’re not getting paid. If “Taylor’s Version” was released as an NFT, she’d be able to share that money with her fans while still achieving her goal of regaining control of her music, opening the door to a financially incentivized fanbase. But why should she? Getting political The reality is that Swift, and most artists, don’t need to share earnings with their fans, because why would you pay a TSA dog? They’re doing their job well. They’re happy. They’re very, very loyal. In fact there’s an overabundance of loyalty that, in an artist’s view, is unlikely to become scarce in the near future. Why fix it if ain’t broke, right? Even if we operate under the assumption that Taylor Swift isn’t a greedy cash-grabber and wants to reward her followers, there’s still a reputational cost for her to enter the NFT space. It would be a burden for her PR team to tediously explain how smart contracts work or why they’re important. It would also require her to dip her toes into an area within politics that’s foreign to her, such as the overblown environmental concerns and the bizarre idea that right-leaning crypto bros represent the entire crypto community. We’re talking career self-sabotage, if not suicide. Despite Swift's absence from public discourse on crypto in general, it would be naive to assume that music NFTs haven’t crossed her mind. She probably saw a number of celebrity friends endorse crypto in the preceding year’s bull run. And even if she hadn't head of NFTs in 2019, it's improbable that she's still ignorant. As of recently, her current record label  purchased a Bored Ape . Not to mention Bella Hadid, one of Swift's closest friends,  launching her own NFT collection.  Even if Swift had not heard about NFTs in 2019, she almost certainly has now. But the political factors alone make for a good business case not to move forward with it. See also:  A New Era of Media Begins With Tokenization  | Opinion (2020) In fairness to Swift, not publishing NFTs was the easiest way to go. If she just wanted to sell music and share her success with fans, why should that require her to prove that liberals can enjoy the benefits of crypto just as much as conservatives? It might  ""get lost in translation,""  or could be seen as ""ask[ing] for too much."" Swift, at the time of releasing “Taylor’s Version,”was attacking the status quo in the entertainment industry where distributors and producers still exercise outsized control. Though a cynic may say she was merely portraying herself as a victimized girlboss who generated sales under the veneer of independence, altruism and feminism. Real rewards Today, there’s a viable way for pop stars to take a principled stand against the traditional music industry: introducing the financialization of fandom. i.e., using crypto for how it was meant to be used. Is it surprising that that hasn’t happened yet in a meaningful way? Not really, considering the people we’re talking about. Celebrities are not absent from the crypto space, they’re just in it for the wrong reasons. Madonna purchasing  a $300,000 Bored Ape  NFT is no different from her purchasing a Birkin bag and Steve Aoki’s personal collection of 10 Bored Ape NFTs is not contributing to mainstream adoption. It stuns me how celebrities are handed all of these investment opportunities without caring about mass adoption. They’re being handed a first-class ticket to the metaverse, and the people they’re bringing onboard basically  end up underwater . I was at the NFT LA conference in March 2022 and one of the panelists was Charlie Sheen, the actor, who had absolutely no idea what he was talking about. Macy Gray, the Grammy-nominated R&B singer who  dabbles with music NFTs herself , said verbatim on another panel that she “does not know much about crypto.” Some are better at parroting talking points, but few understand the seismic shift crypto could represent for art. People do, in fact, say  all’s well that ends well . At this point, it’s hard to believe most celebrities have not been introduced to crypto. But do artists like Taylor Swift have a strong disbelief in the concept of smart contracts and music NFTs, or do they simply not care? I suspect it’s a mix of both. Do Swifties know deep down that they deserve some level of compensation for blasting “Taylor’s Version” 24/7, or are they content with seeing a girlboss succeed? See also:  NFTs, Celebrities and Perverse Deal-Making  | Opinion I guess we’ll never know for sure why Swift turned a blind eye on NFTs but I suspect, or dare I say predict, seeing the mass commercialization of crypto and NFTs by celebrities once the dust settles and the political collateral damage is no longer a factor.

cardano, News , What’s going on with Cardano’s testnet and Vasil hard fork? ,"Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has continued to refute claims that the Cardano’s testnet is “catastrophically broken,” implying the need to finally move forward with the long-delayed Vasil hard fork. In a Twitter thread on Sunday, Hoskinson shared his frustration concerning some of the videos claiming Cardano’s testnet has a “catastrophic” issue, which  stems  from a Friday thread from Cardano ecosystem developer Adam Dean. The developer claimed that the testnet is “catastrophically broken” due to an undiscovered bug in Cardano’s Node v 1.35.2 that creates incompatible forks — which had managed to slip under the radar of the previous testing. Following the bug, Cardano released its new client software, Cardano Node v1.35.3, on two separate testnets.  However, Dean noted that because the majority of operators upgraded to v1.35.2 to simulate the Vasil hard fork, v1.35.3 is also “incompatible and incapable of syncing” with the original testnet, and the two testnets are “without a block history.” Hoskinson has, however, argued that the coding issue found on that node version had been removed in the 1.35.3 update, sharing his frustration that further testing would lead to further delays of the hard fork: “We of course could as a community delay the launch of Vasil for a few months to retest code that’s already been tested a dozen times and is already running. Is that worth it to all the DApp developers who have been waiting for this update for almost a year now?” During an Ask-Me-Anything on Friday, Hoskinson also said that there’s been an “unfair narrative” floating around Cardano and its testnet issues, which he called “incredibly corrosive and damaging.”  “You can’t conflate a failed testnet with the mainnet because testnets are constructed and destroyed all the time in this industry. That’s their point. [...] They are in no way, in any way harm Cardano itself.” On Sunday, Hoskinson noted that “the realities of something this large and complex is that one can be easily trapped by the things that aren't working well and forget the things that are.” He added that one of the results of the Vasil hard fork will be a new governance process and more inclusive structures that will lead to “more useful code” and “faster developments.” “Moments that give us a chance to change and grow. Let’s get Vasil done together and then let’s move on to higher ground and fix some of the original sins of the project so Cardano can also grow to its next level.” Related:  Sell the news? Cardano price risks 20% drop despite Vasil hard fork euphoria The Vasil hard fork has already been  delayed several times this year , with the most recent being at the end of July due to issues identified on the testnet. However, Hoskinson said during the AMA that he is optimistic that the Vasil hard fork will ship “imminently.”  “The features are there, they’ve worked, they’ve been tested thoroughly, and there’s a high degree of confidence in them. There’s no reason for it not to get over the finish line imminently.” Cardano’s  ADA  is priced at $0.45 on Monday, having dropped 18.5% over the last week.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-s-going-on-with-cardano-testnet-and-vasil-hard-fork,cointelegraph,2022-08-22,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Now Supported as Collateral by Kraken Futures,"Cryptocurrency exchange Kraken  has announced  that Cardano (ADA) is now supported as a collateral cryptocurrency on its futures platform. 
 
It also supports such cryptocurrencies as Chainlink (LINK), Polkadot (DOT), Decentraland (MANA), and others.   
  
The native token of one of the leading proof-of-stake protocols can now be used for getting exposure to dozens of cryptocurrency futures contracts.
 Kraken  offers singe-collateral futures and multi-collateral futures. As the name suggests, the first type of futures contracts only allows users to use the base cryptocurrency of a certain pair in the form of collateral. At the same time, the second type lets traders deposit a slew of cryptocurrencies as collateral, meaning that they are not restricted to the base currency. It is worth noting that the  ADA  token has a 10% “haircut,” which is a cut in the margin value of the collateral. For instance, if one’s balance is 1,000 ADA tokens, 900 ADA tokens count toward as collateral that can be used for backing orders.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Price Reversal May Happen Rather Soon, Here's What to Expect","Cardano's price, spurred by the  general decline  of the crypto market and  internal technical problems , has once again fallen to the lower boundary of the price corridor. We are talking about the zone between $0.4 and $0.6 per token, where the ADA price first fell after the crypto market shakeout in May. ADA quotes touched the lowest part of this range twice in the last three months. The first time was directly at the end of the May fall, where there was a massive buyback. The second time that $0.4 per ADA was a strong support was in mid-July. After both of these touches, ADA gained momentum and, a few weeks later, returned to the upper boundary of this corridor, to $0.6 level. Thus, every time during the last three months, when ADA reached a price of $0.4, there was a reversal, and the price of token increased by 50%. ADA now trading at $0.445 may also seem like an attractive investment, but there are two subtleties. The first is that Cardano has received negative press due to Vasil hard fork's postponement and FUD-heated  testnet bugs . The second nuance is technical because $0.445 is not an absolute local bottom, which the price can reach, and in case of further confusion with the network update and a weak crypto market, the ADA price can easily roll back to $0.4 or even lower. Under the current circumstances, if you are planning to increase your ADA bags, it is worth keeping an eye on the news about Vasil hard fork and the behavior of the crypto market. If nothing good happens, it is worth waiting for at least the $0.4 mark. If at least one of the subjects monitored is  showing a positive dynamic , then there is room to ponder.",https://u.today/cardano-price-reversal-may-happen-rather-soon-heres-what-to-expect,utoday,2022-08-22,10:59:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Can Now Be Bought Directly with Japanese Yen Due to New Listing,"The Japanese branch of one of the world's largest crypto exchanges, OKCoin Japan,  announced  the listing of ADA, the main token of the Cardano blockchain. The start of ADA spot trading on the Japanese exchange is Sept. 1, when all interested investors will be able to trade the cryptocurrency against Japan's national currency, the yen. The inclusion of ADA in the listing on OKCoin Japan seems a logical step, given that Cardano takes eighth spot in the ranking of the largest crypto projects by market capitalization. In addition to ADA, such cryptocurrencies as BTC, ETH, XRP and a number of smaller ones have already been listed on the Japanese exchange. A total of 17 pairs are available for crypto enthusiasts to trade on OKCoin Japan. ADA listing on one of Japan's leading exchanges will definitely benefit the project both in terms of Cardano's visibility and in terms of capital. The Japanese are extremely interested in alternative methods of investing due to low returns on traditional financial markets. Moreover, Japanese companies and the government are  rather favorable  to the new digital economy, which also adds to the freedom of circulation of cryptocurrencies. For example, except for the two major cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum,  XRP is very popular in Japan . Banks are even launching XRP rewards programs to attract new users, and large e-commerce businesses are  accepting cryptocurrency  as a means of payment.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Carries Less Risks Than Ethereum or BNB, Here's Why","According to on-chain analytics firm  Santiment , the risk of further declines in Cardano (ADA) quotes are now much lower than those of Ethereum (ETH) or BNB. This thesis on  Cardano  is built on the MVRV metric. As a ratio of market capitalization to realized capitalization, MVRV is used to understand when the price is above or below fair value, as well as to evaluate profitability. Thus, according to Santiment, the MVRV of ADA is now in such a low zone that the risk of further decline is extremely small. This is especially true against the backdrop of ETH and BNB, which have not yet fallen as much as the MVRV ratio. 📊 30-day trading returns continue to point to mid-term losses for the average portfolio. The further into negative territory an asset's MVRV, the lower the risk of further downside, based on backtests.  $ADA  is notably low compared to other top caps.  https://t.co/J5FDAj05bL   pic.twitter.com/9AcIqbX9wg Of course, the crypto market is unpredictable and risky, but this kind of on-chain analysis can be a great help in making investment decisions. The ADA price has been stomping around for a week, after a downfall that started on Aug. 17 and stopped on Aug. 19. If you look at the picture in the context of the last four months, you can see how the quotes froze in the middle of the price corridor of $0.4-$0.6.

On the other hand,  ADA  showed a more than 30% growth at the beginning of June from approximately the same level of $0.465.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Aiming for Bounce from Fundamental 200-Week Support Level: Crypto Market Review, August 25","While most cryptocurrencies on the market are looking for a bounce foundation beneath them, Cardano has reached the fundamental level of the 200-week moving average against  Bitcoin , which forms the green price candle after yesterday's 13% plunge. Unfortunately, the price performance against USD leaves much to be desired. Despite the stalemate on the USD pair, Cardano is showing some bounce potential against Bitcoin, which is clearly not showing any kind of strength on the market for the last few weeks. As the daily chart of the asset and on-chain data suggests, Cardano has more chances for a short-term bounce than most cryptocurrencies on the market. In terms of technical analysis, ADA has reached the local support of the 200-week average, which previously acted as a bounce foundation. ADA entered the 50- and 200-week moving average range back on June 13 and has been moving there for the last nine weeks, which can be considered a consolidation. As mentioned on U.Today before, Cardano is less likely to face another price drop compared to similar cryptocurrencies. The  MVRV ratio for ADA  is at a lower level compared to Ethereum, Solana and others. The reason behind it is the problematic price performance of the assets caused by technical issues on the testnet of the network that questioned the stability of the main network after the final implementation of Vasil. As for now, we can see a gradually decreasing trading volume, which can be considered both positive and negative factors; the drop in volume is useful when whales or any kind of investors are trying to pull assets from the downtrend, but at the same time, it leads to a decrease in liquidity. Since the breakdown on Aug. 18, Bitcoin has shown us zero signs of an upcoming reversal as technical, on-chain and fundamental factors are showing up against the first cryptocurrency. We previously  mentioned  on U.Today that the Long-Term Holders Supply profitability is at an extremely low level. With the profitability of digital gold not recovering, we might see an upcoming redistribution of funds and prolonged consolidation. Until the profitability of the asset recovers, there are not a lot of chances for a reversal as investors are less likely to invest more in the already problematic asset. From the macro-economic standpoint, the situation has not changed as the rate hike cycles continue and the U.S. dollar breaks new highs almost every day, coming close to the aforementioned 2002 high. The only event that might change the balance on the market is the Merge update on Ethereum, which is expected to bring more volatility to Ethereum.

The  Vasil upgrade  hopes to bring greater functionality, performance, scalability and interoperability to Cardano through new features and improvements. The upgrade will enhance smart contracts and is a part of the Basho phase of the Cardano roadmap, which concentrates on scaling and network and ledger optimization, thus enhancing the ledger in numerous ways. Vasil HFC will introduce eagerly awaited features like diffusion pipelining and improvements to Plutus, Cardano's core smart contract language. According to IOG, from a variety of perspectives, the work on Vasil continues to be the most complex program of development and integration to date. This is because it necessitates close coordination across the ecosystem, in addition to requiring a lot of effort from core teams.",https://u.today/cardano-heres-what-might-prompt-mainnet-launch-per-tim-harrison-as-40-of-spo-upgrades-to-vasil-node,utoday,2022-08-25,14:41:00,en

If we look closely at the weekly chart of Cardano, we can see an obvious and common chart pattern that appears prior to large breakouts and price swings. The ascending triangle on Cardano's weekly chart formed only a few weeks ago, when  ADA  failed to break through the local resistance on the Bitcoin pair. If successful, the ascending triangle will act as a trampoline for  Cardano , and the asset will enter a prolonged downtrend that we have not seen for almost a year as ADA entered the downtrend at the beginning of September. For now, ADA has reached the top of the pattern and will trade with extremely low volatility, which is absolutely normal for assets moving inside of a triangle. In addition to decreasing volatility, the trading volume will also remain stale until a breakout or breakdown happens. In addition to the aforementioned pattern, moving averages are closing the distance between each other, which is a direct signal of an upcoming volatility spike. Traditionally, the wide gap between MAs reflects the increasing chances of a consolidation on the market, and a small gap signals the opposite. By the end of September, ADA should reach the end of the triangle as the gap between lines decreases even further, and we should see a spike in the volatility of the asset, which, hopefully, aims upwards.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-shows-biggest-growth-on-market-today-could-be-on-verge-of-breakout,utoday,2022-08-26,10:18:00,en
cardano, News , Cardano hard fork ‘ever closer’ as upgraded SPOs account for 42% of blocks ,"Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK), the blockchain company behind the Cardano network, says the much anticipated Vasil hard fork is “ever closer” after revealing the state of three critical indicators that will trigger the mainnet update.  In a Twitter thread posted on Thursday, IOHK shared its latest “rollout status” of the Vasil upgrade to its 265,800 followers, with updates on “three critical mass indicators,” which will determine when the mainnet update will go ahead. This includes having 75% of mainnet blocks produced by nodes running 1.35.3, around 25 exchanges upgraded (representing 80% of liquidity) as well as the top ten key mainnet  decentralized applications (DApps)  also having upgraded.  On Thursday, the blockchain company noted that Stake Pool Operators (SPOs) running the latest node 1.35.3 now account for 42% of mainnet block production in the current epoch, which is now more than halfway to the 75% required. Mainnet nodes status:   ↗️SPOs/nodes: SPOs running node 1.35.3 (the  #Vasil  release candidate) now account for 40% plus of mainnet block production in the current epoch.

 IOHK also noted that one of the world’s largest exchanges, Binance, has reportedly upgraded its Cardano nodes to the latest version. The firm has been targeting roughly 25 exchanges to upgrade their nodes, as it would account for approximately 80% of its native token’s total liquidity.  Regarding its mainnet DApps, IOHK confirmed that it would continue to stay close to many of the DApp teams on Cardano, with four out of 10 already confirming they are actively testing against node 1.35.3 on the pre-production testnet.  IOHK also shared that no new bugs have been identified, leaving nine minor bugs still to be dealt with, none of which will cause an unintended hard fork.   Related:   What’s going on with Cardano’s testnet and Vasil hard fork? The long-awaited Vasil upgrade is aimed at reducing transaction size and allowing for more network activity while lowering costs.  After a roadmap was  released  by IOHK on May 19, which planned for a hard fork on June 29, the Vasil upgrade has been plagued by delays while developers ensure the network transition proceeds smoothly. Charles Hoskinson, co-founder of Cardano, recently responded to criticism about the upgrade being rushed. He suggested that they could delay the launch for months to retest the code which has already been tested and running, but the DApp developers would not see this as worthwhile given they have waited so long already.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cardano-hard-fork-ever-closer-as-upgraded-spos-account-for-42-of-blocks,cointelegraph,2022-08-26,00:00:00,en
cardano, Newsletter ," Hacker tries to exploit bridge protocol, fails miserably: Finance Redefined  ","Welcome to Finance Redefined, your weekly dose of essential  decentralized finance (DeFi)  insights — a newsletter crafted to bring you significant developments over the last week. This past week, there were some major developments in the run-up to the upcoming Ethereum Merge slated for Sept. 15. Bitfinex became the latest crypto exchange to throw its support behind the chain split token. While DeFi bridge hacks have become a norm this year, developers behind Rainbow Bridge managed to foil an exploit attempt within seconds, leading to the hacker losing their safety deposit. The Tornado Cash developer who was arrested last week was sent to 90-day judicial custody awaiting charges. It didn’t go down well with the crypto community, who have actively rallied behind the developer and have accused the authorities of throttling freedom. Cardano’s testnet and Vasil hard fork ran into trouble again this week as founder Charles Hoskinson took to Twitter to claim that the issues surrounding the hard fork as “incredibly corrosive and damaging” are inaccurate. The top 100 DeFi tokens had a mixed week in terms of price action, with the majority of them trading in the red on the weekly charts, barring a few tokens that have shown even double-digit growth. Hacker tries to exploit bridge protocol, fails miserably Cross-chain bridges have increasingly become  targeted by malicious entities . However, not all hackers can run away with millions in their exploit attempts. Some end up losing money from their own wallets.  In a Twitter thread, Alex Shevchenko, CEO of Aurora Labs, told the story of a hacker who attempted to exploit the Rainbow Bridge but ended up losing 5 Ether ( ETH ), worth around $8,000 at the time of writing. Continue reading Bitfinex offers new chain split tokens ahead of Ethereum Merge iFinex, the company responsible for Bitfinex Derivatives, announced on Tuesday the launch of a new service offering available to users before the highly-anticipated Ethereum Merge. The exchange now offers Ethereum Chain Split Tokens. Tokens available to users represent the two systems involved in the Merge: ETHW, which is proof-of-work (PoW) and ETHS, which is proof-of-stake (PoS). Bitfinex released the new trading tokens so users would be able to trade on the potential forking event. The coins will be available through the Bitfinex derivatives platform. Continue reading Ruling to keep Tornado Cash developer in jail for 90 days sparks backlash A judge in the Netherlands ruled that Tornado Cash developer Alexey Pertsev has to stay in jail for 90 more days while waiting for charges. Puzzled by the decision, the crypto community rallied to demand the release of the developer.  In a Tweet, crypto investor Ryan Adams argued that the developer did something good for the public with his code contributions, stating that “a few bad guys” decided to use Pertsev’s code and now the developer has to suffer the consequences. Continue reading What’s going on with Cardano’s testnet and Vasil hard fork? Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has continued to refute claims that the Cardano’s testnet is “catastrophically broken,” implying the need to finally move forward with the long-delayed Vasil hard fork. In a Twitter thread on Sunday, Hoskinson shared his frustration concerning some of the videos claiming Cardano’s testnet has a “catastrophic” issue, which stems from a Friday thread from Cardano ecosystem developer Adam Dean.

We are witnessing what  @RonPaul  said years ago. The Fed has two options. Kill the economy with high interest rates or destroy the currency with inflation. (1/2) The markets tumbled Friday after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell promised that the central bank would ""use its tools forcefully"" to combat inflation, which is still hovering around its highest level in more than 40 years. In his annual Jackson Hole policy speech, Powell emphasized that higher interest rates are likely to last ""for some time, and the historical record cautions strongly against premature loosening policy."" The comments come amid indications that inflation may have peaked but is not yet clearly declining. As Powell stated, the Fed will not be swayed by a month or two of data. Hoskinson chipped in, ""We are witnessing what @RonPaul said years ago. The Fed has two options. Kill the economy with high-interest rates or destroy the currency with inflation."" The Cardano creator added: ""Cryptocurrencies are the way out of this madness. Central banks can't be trusted with monetary policy. They work for the political process and gave two generations of politicians a blank check that we now have to cover. It's going to get worse before it gets better."" Since Powell's remarks, Bitcoin has fallen more than 8%, bringing the entire cryptocurrency market down with it.

The IOG founder stated that this misinformation is now being propagated to large masses of people by social media influencers. In particular, he shared a tweet which shows a TikTok video with a guy who has over 600,000 followers and he is talking about Cardano, saying that people are starting to lose faith in this blockchain. The TikToker claims that “for a project that has a market cap as high as it has, Cardano does not have much to show for it”. The guy points out that the vision of Cardano team is great but they are not building anything. Finally, the “influencer” claimed that Solana is a “much more functional blockchain and a much more functional platform than Cardano has ever even gotten close to being”. Hoskinson sadly tweeted that influencers are now spreading shallow information to “massive networks of people” and what was recently called a “catastrophic bug” for Cardano is now again paired with  “ghost chain ”, i.e. accusations that poured onto Cardano earlier this year, stating that there is nothing being developed on this platform.

This tweet sparkled a heated debate within the community and some began accusing Cardano, saying that having such bugs before a testnet launch is unacceptable for a chain as prominent as Cardano. About a week ago, the same developer tweeted that Cardano chain was stronger and better than ever, while Cardano pool operator, Andrew Westberg announced that the earlier spotted bugs  were successfully fixed .",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-addresses-return-of-cardano-ghost-chain-fud,utoday,2022-08-27,19:21:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here's Why Cardano's Decentralization Networking Update Is Most Important Part of Vasil,"With the Vasil update on the horizon, numerous parts of the  Cardano  network are going to be upgraded, polished and released, but one of the most anticipated and importants parts of the hard fork is the decentralization of the networking layer, which will make Cardano more  decentralized  and resilient. Cardano has previously reached complete decentralization of block production, which is an important step prior to the networking update. This layer is a physical infrastructure that combines nodes and their interaction into a unified system. #Decentralization  of the networking layer of  #Cardano  is the most anticipated upgrade after the  #Vasil  HFC event 
 
P2P is one such upgrade that will make  #Cardano  a far more decentralized & resilient network than what's it now 
 
So here's a thread on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking This layer of the system is designed for distributing information about transactions and block creation among all the nodes operating at this point. The networking layer is one of the three pillars that hold the Cardano blockchain. In order to achieve maximum effectiveness of the network, the nodes must have minimum communication delay while having strong resilience to failures, capacity constraints or hackers. As for now, Cardano's networking layer is based on the TCP/IP stack, which ensures relatively fast and safe data delivery between nodes. The configuration is based on a centralized tool called a ""topology updater."" With the Vasil hard fork, the layer will no longer use the topology updater but utilize a P2P network, which is expected to enhance the flow of information between nodes and remove the need to use centralized services. Technically,  Cardano  will reach complete decentralization as the components of the P2P network will be a P2P governor, a connection manager, an inbound protocol governor and a server. P2P has always been a much-anticipated upgrade for Cardano, which is going to enable complete decentralization of the networking layer and add more full nodes like Daedalus to propagate blocks.",https://u.today/heres-why-cardanos-decentralization-networking-update-is-most-important-part-of-vasil,utoday,2022-08-28,11:11:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here's How Cardano's Peer-to-peer Networking Aids Blockchain: Details,"According to a  Cardano user , ""Sooraj,"" the decentralization of the networking layer, or P2P networking, is the most anticipated upgrade after the Vasil hard fork event. The P2P upgrade hopes to make Cardano a far more decentralized and resilient network than it is now. #Decentralization  of the networking layer of  #Cardano  is the most anticipated upgrade after the  #Vasil  HFC event 
 
P2P is one such upgrade that will make  #Cardano  a far more decentralized & resilient network than what's it now 
 
So here's a thread on peer-to-peer (P2P) networking At the heart of the Cardano network are 3,198 stake pools run by operators (SPOs) who manage the distributed nodes that keep the network running. It goes without saying that there needs to be reliable communication between these nodes in a decentralized and distributed network. The decentralization of Cardano puts the responsibility for running the blockchain in the hands of stake pools. An essential element in this are reliable and effective connections between all the distributed nodes and ensuring that the network is resilient to failure. In December 2021, Cardano kicked off an important initiative to support its ongoing drive toward full decentralization with the launch of the peer-to-peer (P2P)  testnet . P2P communication hopes to improve the flow of information between nodes. For now, the topology updater will continue to serve as a workaround until Cardano fully transitions to a P2P network. The Cardano network will be fully decentralized once the P2P nodes are fully deployed, which will end the network's need for centralized services like the topology updater. In a thread of tweets, ""Sooraj"" highlights that ""According to the latest information available from InputOutputHK, the P2P development is feature complete & all the essential testing has been done. It is undergoing a review of design & implementation. The rollout of P2P nodes will occur in a gradual manner."" 150 papers, 3 million person community in 100+ countries, 1000+ projects building on Cardano, higher brand engagement than IBM and BMW, listed on 200 exchanges, always been operational since launch, adopted by countries and fortune 500 companies....

cardano, News , Cardano outranks Bitcoin in global top intimate brands in new report ,"Blockchain developer Cardano represents the crypto space with a top spot in a new report on global brand intimacy. Cardano ranks 26 among 600 brands and holds the top spot in the crypto industry, according to a report released by brand relations agency MBLM. According to the  report , brand intimacy refers to the emotional connections brands are able to create with their user base and audience. MBLM utilized artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to understand consumer relationships with some of the world’s leading brands, including Disney, Tesla and Apple. Across 19 industries analyzed, crypto was among the top 10 perform, with Cardano in the lead, followed by Bitcoin as a brand at #30. Whereas crypto brands such as Uniswap and Solana took #261 and #265, respectively. In comparison to last year, the surveyors said Cardano is not only a new entry but the highest ranked in crypto and the highest performing financial services brand in the study. In a statement to Cointelegraph, Charles Hoskinson, the co-founder of Cardano, said the company was born of a simple belief that everyone is equal and should live in a fair society. Cardano works towards this through decentralization and merit, he added. “What’s nice about that is that it doesn’t require a founder, a particular culture or country. Now we have people in the Cardano ecosystem from more than 100 different countries working together towards this end.” On Twitter, users reacted to Cardano’s ranking, outpacing legacy brands like Google and eBay. One user  tweeted  that Cardano is not just a subject for internet memes but in a “league where the big boys are.”  Reflections from the report also highlight the impact of the global pandemic stating that brand performance has increased by 19% since before the pandemic. Cardano’s high performance comes as  the blockchain developer prepares for a major network upgrade . It is currently preparing for the long-awaited Vasil hard fork, which aims to reduce the size of transactions, lower costs, and allow more network activity. The top ranks of the crypto industry as a whole speak to the increasing mass adoption of Web3 and decentralized technologies.

cardano,Business,Cardano Builder IOG Funds $4.5M Blockchain Research Hub at Stanford University,"Cardano blockchain builder Input Output Global (IOG) has funded a $4.5 million blockchain hub at Stanford University, the latest in a series of academic research outposts around the globe. In addition to Stanford, IOG has opened research labs and collaboration projects with the University of Edinburgh, University of Wyoming, University of Athens and Tokyo Institute of Technology. Last year, Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson donated $20 million to Carnegie Mellon University  (CMU) to establish the Hoskinson Center for Formal Mathematics. Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., is a hotbed of tech innovation; the place opened a  Center for Blockchain Research back in 2018 , led by Dan Boneh and David Mazières, two professors who specialize in cryptography. IOG has been collaborating with Stanford for some time, said Tim Harrison, vice president of Community and Ecosystem at IOG. “Before the research hub, we previously donated $500,000 to fund their research into blockchain scalability. As one of the world’s leading academic institutions, Stanford is an ideal location for the hub,” Harrison said in an email. Asked if the new IOG-backed blockchain hub would promote the Cardano ecosystem or things like Haskell, the mathematical programming language used in the creation of Cardano smart contracts, Harrison said the project is “to fund researchers from multidisciplinary backgrounds.” Working with the likes of Stanford to set up blockchain research hubs is key to the IOG vision, said CEO Charles Hoskinson. “With the Research Hub, blockchain development can grow even faster, based on the new learnings that will emerge, and the hub will add a new layer of validity to our sector that we haven’t always been afforded,” Hoskinson said in a statement. “Healthy competition is a vital part of any growing industry, but especially in its early days, every player also needs to play its part in growing the space as a whole,” Harrison said. “Researchers at the university will be able to put forward innovative projects that will impact the blockchain industry.”",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/29/cardano-builder-iog-funds-45m-blockchain-research-hub-at-stanford-university/,coindesk,2022-08-29,20:00:00,en

Consequently, the top cryptocurrencies lost all of their most recent gains as Cardano (ADA) tumbled to hit lows of $0.425 while Dogecoin fell to $0.061. Data from WhaleStats, which tracks the top BSC wallets, indicates that large holders scooped up Cardano (ADA), Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies, as these are among the top 10 cryptos purchased by the biggest 100 BSC whales over the last 24 hours. Expectations regarding the upcoming Cardano Vasil update might have partly contributed to the recent whale buy-up. As reported by U.today, Vasil is now ""closer than ever."" According to Pooltool data, the block-producing node metric is at 77% for the epoch so far. Meanwhile, to trigger the upgrade, the ""node readiness"" metric aims at 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the Vasil node at 1.35.3. As of IOG's recent report, Bitrue, NDAX.io and LCX exchanges indicated readiness for Vasil, while Binance and several others were in the process of upgrading their nodes. Likewise, the top Cardano dApps are currently performing final integration tests, with a few already ticking ""tested"" status. For fun I shared an idea and  @inevitable360  helped bring it to fruition.

Following the latest epoch boundary cross,  #Cardano  treasury now sits at ONE BILLION ada. 👀 The  Treasury's goal  is to provide funds to support Cardano's development through a voting system. This necessitates a process whereby funds are routinely sent to the Treasury to ensure that funds are always available. Cardano's Voltaire Era introduced decentralized voting and treasury systems to empower the community to influence Cardano's evolution and provide a funding mechanism to transform Cardano into a self-funded, self-sustainable environment. Cardano has seen significant developments in the past few months as more projects are building on it. Currently, 1,075 projects are building on Cardano, while 93 projects have recently been launched on Cardano. Cardano native tokens stand at 5.9 million with 60,468 minting policies, while Plutus scripts are now at 3,117. Some of these initiatives may have received funding assistance from the Treasury. The last Project Catalyst Fund 8 winners and other funding initiatives received over 27 million ADA tokens in June.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder Comments on Market Crash, SHIB Slips in Rankings, Three Reasons Why BTC Is at $20,000: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","Let’s see what the weekend brought in terms of crypto news with U.Today’s top four news stories. Friday’s market tumble has not left anyone indifferent, including  Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson. In his Saturday tweets, Hoskinson commented on “another brutal red day,” saying that Ron Paul’s forecast shared years ago is now coming true and that the Fed has two options: “kill the economy with high-interest rates or destroy the currency with inflation.” The Cardano creator added that the way out of this madness is cryptocurrencies, since “central banks can't be trusted with monetary policy.” The market crash is related to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's recent hawkish speech in Jackson Hole, in which he promised that the central bank would ""use its tools forcefully"" to combat inflation. ADA, along with other major cryptos, dropped 8% to trade at $0.447 after Powell’s remarks and remains on the same level. It looks like Peter Brandt’s  Shiba Inu bullish prediction  has not played out. The second largest meme coin  slipped to 14th place  by market capitalization on CoinMarketCap after shedding almost 7% over the past week. It is now sitting below Polygon (MATIC) and Dai (DAI). SHIB is currently down 33% from its Aug. 14 peak. At the moment of publication, it is trading at $0.00001237, per CoinMarketCap. However, despite its non-inspiring price performance, Shiba Inu has managed to maintain an active community, with new members joining every day. As  reported by U.Today , the meme token’s official Twitter account recently flipped Dogecoin by the number of followers. To the great disappointment of all  Bitcoin  holders, the king crypto dropped to the $20,000 level. As unpleasant as it may be, the event, however, was no surprise, for three reasons. First is the speech of the Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, who stated that the U.S. central bank will remain hawkish for a while, which goes against previous expectations of financial markets. Second is the lack of institutional inflows on the market in the last two weeks. The situation will most likely change after the end of the rate hike cycles by the beginning of 2023. Third is a lack of events around the first cryptocurrency, which brings no growth factors. The only thing that might ‌bring fresh capital to the market is the Ethereum Merge update. According to an  Ethereum  chart shared by CryptoQuant analyst Benjamin Cowen, the second biggest cryptocurrency is “heading home.” This means that Ethereum is moving to the curved accumulation range that ETH reached during every correction and then bounced off of successfully. Given the current market decline, Cowen anticipates a drop to the accumulation area around $500. Even though such a decline would be critical for Ethereum, the market has already seen Ethereum losing 90% of its value, so it is not unprecedented. The overall situation on the chart has not changed since the beginning of 2022, as the second biggest cryptocurrency on the  market  entered a prolonged downtrend after topping out at $4,850.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-comments-on-market-crash-shib-slips-in-rankings-three-reasons-why-btc-is-at-20000,utoday,2022-08-29,16:05:00,en

According to DeFiLlama's ranking of decentralized finance platforms, Cardano remains in a distant place, far from catching up with other major networks such as BSC, Avalanche and Tron. At the time of publication, Cardano's TVL was $80 million. The Vasil upgrade hopes to bring greater functionality, performance, scalability and interoperability to Cardano through new features and improvements. The upgrade will enhance smart contracts and is part of the Basho phase of the Cardano roadmap, which concentrates on scaling and network and ledger optimization, thus enhancing the ledger in numerous ways.

He stated that he is excited to support this company’s mission to improve the sphere of microfinance around the world. Hilda is one of the great entrepreneurs of Africa and I'm excited to support her in Pezesha's mission to change Microfinance throughout the world.  https://t.co/UcRNYPEOMh According to  Techcrunch , IOG and Women’s World Banking Capital Partners II fund, have led an investment round of $11 million in Pezesha. This fintech company intends to roll out to other countries in Africa – Nigeria, Rwanda and Francophone Africa after the pre-series A equity debt it has just conducted. The source stated that $5 million were invested by Talanton and Verdant Capital Specialist Funds. The rest - $6 million – came from IOG and several investment funds. Pezesha deals with lending, it has created its own scalable infrastructure for digital lending, attracting local financial institutions to offer micro lending to SME in African countries. Moraa stated that there are plenty of opportunities to solve problems to do with working capital faced by SMEs in Africa. Among other things, Pezesha ensures quality and responsible borrowing of funds by entrepreneurs. Pezesha’s partners in this business have integrated their credit scoring APIs to help customers get loan offers in real time. At the moment, the company has more than 20 partners, which are offering loans to more than 100 thousand businesses. By the end of 2022, this number is expected to grow as 10 more companies are waiting to integrate in this lending infrastructure. After the expansion of this business, SMEs will be able to borrow up to $10,000 at a moderate interest rate to be paid back within one year. Moraa intends to start collaborating with new local and international financial companies, with wealthy individuals and DeFi platforms in order to offer $100 million in loans on an annual basis in the future. Per Techcrunch,  Charles Hoskinson  believes that investing in Pezesha is a major milestone for Cardano, since initiating flows of finance into developing countries in order to support the growth of their economy and the creation of jobs in the main goal of cryptocurrencies and DLT overall. For Cardano, it is vital to make it easier for people around the world to take loans and offer them on a regulatory basis. Now, he believes Cardano’s investment in Africa an achievement.

He stated that “there is no magic reserve of ADA” which could be burned. Charles Hoskinson has replied to a comment from a @PerAsperaVinco Twitter user, in which the latter reproached him of being ignorant when saying that destroying ADA would mean destroying Cardano fans’ property. Hoskinson explained that other projects sometimes have a stash of premined coins controlled by founders. During periods of lower liquidity they manipulate their token’s price by burning large amounts of it. However, he stressed that Cardano does not control any amounts of ADA. The astonishing power of ignorance is revealed when people cannot grasp that there is no magic reserve of Ada floating out there. All Ada is in the hands of owners, actual people, to burn it would require it be taken from them and destroyed  https://t.co/kGzwFyg3nS All ADA tokens, according to him, belong to ADA holders and SPOs (Stake Pool Operators). They earn rewards in ADA, reminded Hoskinson, and taking away ADA from them to burn would be nothing but stealing their property.

Take a look at the most important of them with U.Today’s top four news stories. As per Bloomberg’s recent report,  JPMorgan’s  chief global strategist David Kelly stated that investors should get rid of their crypto stashes. He believes that the Fed’s hawkishness will cause more problems for digital assets. Kelly is also bearish on large-cap tech stocks. This year, Bitcoin has traded alongside with the heavily tech-weighted Nasdaq 100 index, failing to serve as an inflation hedge. At the moment of publication, the first cryptocurrency is changing hands at $20,315, down almost 6% over the past week. Bitcoin took a sharp nose dive after Fed Chair Jerome Powell’s speech at the Jackson Hole conference, in which he said that the central bank would continue its aggressive campaign. ShibaSwap’s main token,  BONE , demonstrated a 110% price increase in two days. Such a rampant spike was most likely caused by the wave of news and speculation about  BONE listing  on big centralized crypto exchanges. First, Gate held a vote for BONE listing, and then BlueBit officially announced the start of token trading. Thanks to the token’s low liquidity and the announcement of the listing, the crypto community got very excited and started actively buying BONE. This resulted in the coin breaking away from its historic highs by 100%, and it remains unknown where its price discovery will end. SHIB Metaverse’s developers  have announced  that they are going to add a crucial upgrade to the project: the WAGMI Temple HUB. This is just one of numerous HUBs that the THIRD FLOOR (TTF) studio and the Metaverse team are working on together. This particular HUB is intended to be similar to a Zen-like realm, where users will be able to experience calming sensations and practice meditation and ""spiritual connections to the world.""

This time, the reason for discussion was one of the largest crypto exchanges, Coinbase, or rather its inaction. The problem is that one of the necessary components in order to fully operationalize Vasil hard fork is to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to readiness. While exchanges like Bitrue or Bitmart are fully ready, and Binance and OKex have already started the process, Coinbase has not even launched the update mechanism yet. #CardanoCommunity  waiting for  @coinbase  to start upgrading for the  #VasilHardFork  ⌛⏲😉 #Cardano   pic.twitter.com/pbhMeBMWgh It would seem that Coinbase is not the only exchange yet inactive with regard to Vasil hard fork, but it is the only one among the largest.

This week, we’re well on our way to hitting our indicators. Over 80% of SPOs have upgraded and more than 70% of the top DApps we’re tracking have confirmed successful pre-production testing.✅4/8 Last month, IOG stated it would be tracking three critical mass indicators ahead of triggering the hard fork, which are: 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the final release candidate, roughly 25 exchanges upgraded (representing 80% of liquidity) and the top 10 dApps by TVL updated. In the recent  IOG report , over 83% of SPOs have been upgraded, which indicates that the ""node readiness"" metric has already been met. The Cardano developer also gives an update on the exchanges, which it says are currently busy with their Vasil integration. Among the top 12 exchanges by liquidity, two exchanges, namely Bitrue and MEXC, have confirmed their readiness. Other exchanges that have confirmed their readiness include BitMart and LCX. IOG notes that there are at least 27 exchanges in the process of integrating, 5 of which are in the top 10 for liquidity.

cardano, Analysis , Blockchain firms fund university research hubs to advance growth  ,"The demand for organizations to adopt blockchain technology is growing rapidly. Recent findings from market research and advisory firm Custom Market Insights  found  that the global blockchain technology market size was valued at $4.8 billion in 2021, yet this amount is expected to reach $69 billion by 2030. While notable, it’s become critical for the industry to enable rigorous research into the development of the blockchain sector.  Tim Harrison, vice president of community and ecosystem at Input Output Global (IOG) — the developer arm behind the Cardano blockchain — told Cointelegraph that during the past year, the blockchain ecosystem has witnessed various risks from projects that have taken a “go fast and break things” approach.  “Not only do these companies run these risks for themselves, but mistakes and failures can also negatively impact their end consumers,” he said. As such, Harrison believes that peer-reviewed research can help prevent such situations while also resolving issues that continue to linger from earlier iterations of blockchain development.  Companies fund university-led research hubs In order to ensure that blockchain projects are thoroughly researched moving forward, Harrison noted that IOG recently funded a $4.5 million Blockchain Research Hub at Stanford University. According to Harrison, the hub’s goal is to enrich the body of scientific knowledge within the blockchain and distributed ledger industry while driving a greater focus on fundamental research.  Although the Blockchain Research Hub at Stanford was just announced on August 29, 2022, Aggelos Kiayias, chief scientist at IOG and a professor at the University of Edinburgh, told Cointelegraph that he believes the center will help the industry collectively solve current challenges.  For instance, Kiayias pointed out that IOG previously donated $500,000 to fund research for blockchain scalability with Stanford. This was an important initiative, as blockchain scalability  remains one of the biggest issues  hampering industry adoption. Yet, Kiayias noted that Stanford’s new Blockchain Research Hub will take this a step further since the projects being funded will come from researchers across a range of disciplines and backgrounds.  Kiayias added that research hubs associated with universities will likely add more value than typical blockchain-focused courses. “Stanford’s research hub will allow researchers to investigate the kinds of subjects that they are specifically interested in, giving them more freedom than taking a standard class,” he remarked. While many universities currently offer  blockchain courses within their curriculum , research hubs funded by the industry may be the next step for universities aiming to advance the industry.  For example, Dawn Song, founder of Oasis Labs and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, told Cointelegraph that Oasis Protocol, along with a number of other blockchain companies, has provided funding for the Berkeley Center for Responsible, Decentralized Intelligence (RDI). According to Song, RDI was founded about one year ago as a multi-disciplinary, campus-wide initiative focused on advancing the science, technology and education of decentralization.  Song explained that the research at RDI is focused on areas including blockchain scalability, security and privacy, usability and  decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) . For example, Song noted that research for zero-knowledge proofs is critical for ensuring scalability and privacy for blockchain projects.  Given this, she pointed out that RDI researchers have started working on a project called Orion, which is a new zero-knowledge argument system. Song also mentioned that RDI researchers are developing a new type of key maintenance mechanism that will ensure greater usability. The project is known as the “multi-factor key derivation function” and expands upon password-based key derivation functions with support from other popular authentication factors. While innovative, Song added that RDI’s research is unique in the sense that the center is interdisciplinary:  “RDI contains faculty from Berkeley’s computer science department, finance and economics and the law school. RDI’s research covers many different disciplines that are more in-depth in comparison with blockchain courses. We focus on research, education and entrepreneurship, which can then help develop courses to train a new generation of students entering this industry.”  In addition to physical research facilities at universities like Stanford and Berkeley, virtual research hubs are being established. For example, Klaytn, an Asia-based layer-1 blockchain, recently  committed  $20 million in funding for a virtual research institute to support industry growth. Known as the “Blockchain Research Center” (BRC), this program will be run by a global consortium led by researchers from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) and the National University of Singapore (NUS).  Sangmin Seo, representative director of the Klaytn Foundation, told Cointelegraph that researchers from KAIST and NUS will also work closely with an international team of principal investigators from six other universities, such as UC Berkeley, Princeton University and Georgia Institute of Technology. “With BRC operating in an open-source manner, other researchers beyond these universities will be able to participate in ongoing research projects or submit their own proposals,” he remarked.  Seo shared that BRC research will span seven pillars focused on topics such as consensus, privacy, smart contacts, decentralized finance (DeFi) and the Metaverse. He added that although BRC is virtual, the program will regularly conduct community outreach efforts such as hosting conferences and workshops.  In addition, the Alogrand Foundation, which is responsible for maintaining the Algorand blockchain ecosystem, has  committed  $50 million in funding for a virtual research program. The Algorand Centres of Excellence (ACE) program started in August 2022 and takes a strong focus on the development of real-world blockchain solutions, along with social impact and sustainability projects. Hugo Krawczyk, principal researcher at Algorand Foundation and head of the ACE program, told Cointelegraph that research teams are located across the globe to ensure a focus on local communities. He added that ACE researchers are tackling a number of problems associated with cryptography since this is the backbone of blockchain security:  “We are also analyzing errors in smart contracts as errors in these can lead to huge losses of money and confidence.”  Importance of university-led blockchain research hubs  While it’s noteworthy that blockchain projects are supporting the development of university-led research programs, the scope of these initiatives extend far beyond marketing tactics or research for a company’s own project. Shedding light on this, Krawczyk explained that although the Algorand Foundation is committed to developing its own ecosystem, emerging research hubs such as ACE are focused on advancing the entire blockchain industry: “This is not just about educating developers to work on our own projects, but it’s about researching multiple projects that can help advance the blockchain sector. Even though we compete with each other, collaborating with others is beneficial for the space to mature and evolve.” Echoing this, Harrison mentioned that although there is a lot of competition in the blockchain space, healthy competition is a vital part of any growing industry. “Especially in its early days, every player also needs to play its part in growing the space as a whole,” he remarked.  Indeed, collaboration seems to be key when it comes to these research centers. For instance, Song mentioned that Berkeley’s RDI will work closely with Stanford’s blockchain research hub. Krawczyk added that there is an ACE research center at Yale University that collaborates with Columbia University and the City College of New York.  Another important point to note is that while it’s innovative for universities to offer blockchain courses as part of their curriculum, research hubs go a step further. Steven Lupin, director of the Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation at the University of Wyoming, told Cointelegraph that university research hubs offer distinctive, hands-on learning opportunities. He said:  “These programs allow students to roll up their sleeves and develop and deploy blockchain and digital asset projects in a real-world environment. Universities also take a leading role in developing standards and governance that’s more difficult for the industry to create due to competitive pressures.”  For instance, Lupin mentioned that the University of Wyoming Center for Blockchain and Digital Innovation — which was founded in 2019 and is focused on developing educational programs and applied projects across campus — is working on a  smart contract research group to develop standards , governance and interoperability to allow smart contracts to be deployed more effectively. While university-led blockchain research centers may be the next logical step for advancing the blockchain ecosystem, more work needs to be done to ensure that such programs are created.  “With Web3 still in its early stages, one research center alone is unable to solve all the challenges that lie ahead. More research centers are required to collectively solve such challenges,” Seo remarked. He added that research centers such as Klaytn’s BRC are multi-year projects that take time and effort to develop.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-firms-fund-university-research-hubs-to-advance-growth,cointelegraph,2022-09-01,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,This Is Why Cardano Performed Best Among Top 10 Cryptocurrencies in Last 7 Days,"According to  CoinGecko  and  CoinMarketCap , Cardano has fallen the least in the last seven days among the top 10 crypto assets, excluding stablecoins. While the fall of Cardano according to different shades of portals ranged from 3% to 4.6%, other cryptocurrencies lost more than 6% in price. The absolute loser of the last seven days was Solana, whose quotations fell by 14% during the period under review. The drop in quotes across the market spectrum is neither surprising nor interesting, but ADA's resilience gives grounds for reflection. Among the possible reasons would be the Cardano development team's progress on the  Vasil hard fork  case. Yes, the long-awaited update has been postponed many times and has made tragic headlines about catastrophic bugs along the way, but now it seems that  Vasil  is indeed on the finish line. It is worth recalling that Vasil hard fork should take blockchain to a qualitatively different level of scaling, performance and functionality. Maybe the approach of this event awakens investors' fear of missing out and makes them hold and buy  ADA . Another reason for Cardano's latest performance may lie in the asset's price chart. Looking at the ADA chart, there is a feeling that there is simply nowhere to fall. Since its all-time high almost a year ago, the  ADA price  has corrected by 85%, which is traditionally considered a sufficient value on the crypto market. ADA has been trading in the $0.4-$0.6 range for the past four months and has never fallen below that value. Moreover, the token's price right now is $0.44, which is not much higher than the lower boundary of this very price corridor.",https://u.today/this-is-why-cardano-performed-best-among-top-10-cryptocurrencies-in-last-7-days,utoday,2022-09-01,10:21:00,en

Additionally, Cardano developer IOHK stated that they are  close to clinching ""three critical mass indicators "" that would lead to the launch of their long-awaited Vasil hard fork in September. Vasil aims to improve Cardano's scalability and transaction throughput through pipelining. The upgrade could also improve the decentralized application (DApp) and smart contract capabilities by changing the Plutus script, a programming language used for smart contracts on the Cardano blockchain. This week, we’re well on our way to hitting our indicators.

The Nasdaq-listed company has significantly expanded the list of available cryptocurrencies this year after refraining from listing new digital tokens for a long period of time. 
 
The latest listing comes on the cusp of Cardano's Vasil upgrade, which is expected to finally take place this September, according to founder Charles Hoskinson. Traders do not seem to be overly excited about the listing. The ADA token is still down 0.4% in spite of the Robinhood listing, struggling to buck the broader bearish trend. As  reported by U.Today , Robinhood added meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) in April after a petition to list the token surpassed half a million signatures. The commission-free investing app also enabled support for Polygon (MATIC), Solana (SOL) and Compound (COMP) that month. In late June, Robinhood listed  Chainlink (LINK) , the native token of the oracle application of the same name. On Wednesday, the popular trading platform also launched  MATIC deposits and withdrawals  on the Polygon network in order to ensure cheaper fees and faster transactions. 
 
After riding the bull market wave in 2021, Robinhood saw its shares plummet in 2021, with active users abandoning platforms.

Vasil is a major upgrade designed to increase Cardano's scaling capabilities and reduce transaction costs, and had originally been scheduled for a June release on a test network. A hard fork is a backward-incompatible change to the software used to validate and produce new blocks. The rollout underwent multiple  delays , however. But IOG said in its tweets Friday that the upgrade had met its criteria of “the successful completion [and] extensive testing of all core components, plus confirmed community readiness.” IOG said the network’s upgrade readiness could be tracked on this  web page .

It has not gone unnoticed by the  major celebrities  either. The second largest area of Cardano projects is ""Community & Social,"" which is already more surprising. Drawing an analogy, one would think that Cardano attracts those projects that seek to reach as many people as possible. The DeFi component in the  Cardano-built  family of projects is only 2.3% of 1,076, but if you take the broader concept of decentralized finance, with wallets, lending, oracles and stablecoins, the number is clearly higher.

Despite moving in a prolonged downtrend,  ADA  is constantly testing local resistance levels and aiming for a rapid recovery as the overall profitability of the asset is still on one of the lowest levels compared to Ethereum or even Bitcoin, which faced an almost 80% correction. As for now,  Cardano  is desperately trying to break above the 50-day moving average, which acts as a barrier for assets moving in a downtrend. If broken, ADA would be able to move toward the next resistance level at almost $0.7, the price level that corresponds to the 200-day moving average.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Hits Peak Network Performance Ahead of Vasil Mainnet Launch: Details,"As shared by  Rick McCracken DIGI , a Cardano community member and also a stake pool operator, the network sync for Vasil node candidate 1.35.3 across the more than 400 reporting nodes is at 99.77%, which demonstrates a very high-performance network. Rick states that this metric had always been in the range of 97 to 99%. Happy Monday! 😃 
The network sync  @PooltoolI  for Cardano node 1.35.3 across the 400+ reporting nodes is at 99.77% and demonstrates a very high-performance network. My normal observations have typically been 97 to 99%. #Cardano   #Ada   #goingfornumber1   pic.twitter.com/AMLHpMpzsF Vasil functionality is reliant on a strong majority of block-producing nodes running the latest 1.35.3 version. To trigger the upgrade, IOG has set a target of 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the final Vasil node candidate. Currently, this metric has been met with more than 87% of the block percentage. The Vasil upgrade hopes to bring significant improvements using the hard fork combinator (HFC) approach and enhance the network's performance by increasing throughput, script efficiency and reducing latency in block transmission. The upgrade, which is also expected to enhance smart contracts, is part of the Basho phase of the Cardano roadmap that concentrates on scaling and network and ledger optimization. Vasil HFC will introduce eagerly awaited features like diffusion pipelining and improvements to Plutus, Cardano's core smart contracts language. Presently, multiple stakeholders, including SPOs, exchanges and dApp projects, are upgrading their nodes and testing their code and other Cardano components ahead of the Vasil upgrade  scheduled  for this month. As reported by  U.Today , the Cardano network has set a new milestone with more than six million native assets minted on the network. According to pool.pm data, the number of native assets issued on the Cardano blockchain is presently 6,020,615, with 61,055 distinct minting policies. In 2020, Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano, predicted that the ecosystem would grow as there would be ""hundreds of assets, thousands of dApps, tons of interesting projects, and lots of unique and utility."" This prediction seems to be currently playing out.",https://u.today/cardano-hits-peak-network-performance-ahead-of-vasil-mainnet-launch-details,utoday,2022-09-05,12:19:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano Surges 13% in One Week, Achieves Best Result in Top 10","The first week of September was neither fish nor meat; nevertheless, Cardano emerged as the clear winner. The Input Output project's native token, ADA, managed to show growth of 13%, outperforming all competitors in CoinMarketCap's top 10 by market capitalization. Moreover,  Cardano (ADA)  became the sixth most profitable cryptocurrency among all the coins in the top 100, behind only other fundamentally strong coins such as Cosmos (ATOM) and Chainlink (LINK). The excellent growth shown by Cardano during the week allowed the cryptocurrency to overtake its eternal neighbor at the top,  XRP . The capitalization gap between the two projects is $470 million, where Cardano has a capitalization of $16.7 billion. Above Cardano at the moment are stablecoins and three unshakable giants represented by BNB, ETH and BTC. Putting this trinity out of brackets, such high capitalizations of ""crypto dollars"" eloquently reflect the current mood of the crypto market. When you do not want to get under the paws of a bear, it is better to sit on the fence. According to an official statement from Cardano parent company Input Ouput, the long-awaited  Vasil hard fork  is set to take place on Sept. 22. The event is extremely fundamental for the Cardano ecosystem and should help it reach the next level. At the same time, the ADA price is in the middle of the $0.4-$0.6 price corridor where it has been moving for the past four months. Will the Vasil update be able to push Cardano quotes to the top? Possibly, but a bearish crypto market may not allow such an opportunity. Is it possible to go at least to the upper limit of the range on the expectation of Vasil? This might be more likely.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Finalizes Successful Breakout, But There's Problem: Crypto Market Review, September 5","In one of U.Today's market reviews, we  mentioned  how Cardano could be on the verge of a breakout that might become a starting point for a new rally to help cryptocurrency gain a solid foothold at the top of the market. As we expected, a breakout has occurred. On the ADA/BTC trading pair, one of the biggest Ethereum competitors started rallying during the weekend trading session as bulls were able to break the local resistance with less selling pressure compared to regular days of trading. Unfortunately, after bears have awakened, ADA faced an immediate spike in the negative trading volume and lost almost 2% of its previously gained value. While the coin has not lost even half of what it has gained during weekend trading, it should be considered a worrying sign. With the negativity prevailing on the  cryptocurrency market , Bitcoin will most likely continue to face elevated selling pressure, which might push ADA further against BTC and create a false feeling of safety for investors. If we take a look at the ADA/USD pair, it becomes clear that the asset failed to break through the local resistance level of the 50-day moving average. Another unsuccessful attempt to break the moving average would be the third time ADA could not enter recovery mode, which might be a bittersweet pill to take for the supporter of the coin on the market. The DXY index that represents the movement of the U.S. dollar against a bracket of foreign currencies has reached a 20-year high today, showing how far the financial market is from returning to conditions we saw in the last 12 years. The strict monetary policy is still providing significant pressure on risk-on assets, including cryptocurrencies that have already lost around 70% of their value since the all-time high we saw back in November. With the rising value of the world's leading currency,  institutional investors  tend to move their holdings toward the U.S. dollar or investment tools that benefit from the rising value of the currency. At the beginning of next week, we will finally see the implementation of the biggest update in the digital assets industry for the last year. Ethereum will no longer use the PoW consensus algorithm. Miners are still moving their hashpower into alternative options like Ethereum Classic or Ravencoin, which has recently gained first place among the top of most profitable cryptocurrencies in the last 24 hours. As more miners move to networks like Ravencoin and Ethereum Classic, investors believe that those networks will start growing exponentially as their fundamental value increases thanks to the power invested in their blockchains.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-finalizes-successful-breakout-but-theres-problem-crypto-market-review-september-5,utoday,2022-09-05,14:31:00,en

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Says Bitcoin Should Adopt Cardano's Ofelimous Protocol to Survive,"Founder of  Cardano , IOG and one of the Ethereum creators, Charles Hoskinson, has recorded a video where he comments on the recent White House recommendations about cracking down on all energy intensive industries, including Bitcoin mining. Hoskinson believes that recently presented Cardano protocol Ofelimous may help Bitcoin survive as a cryptocurrency. Ofelimous is a proof-of-useful-work protocol that was created to reduce the carbon footprint of proof-of-work chains, like Bitcoin and many other coins. Ofelimous  is a recently introduced, provably secure, proof-of-useful-work protocol whose aim is to reduce the amount of energy utilized by proof-of-work chains down to a minimum. Unlike proof-of-work, proof-of-useful-work ensures that the computation power of miners is directed at solving problems coming from real world. However, this makes the blockchain that has adopted it less secure, as an attacker may use the system to solve easy problems, thus creating more blocks that miners would with the same resources. However, Cardano assures that Ofelimous can easily solve this dilemma. Hoskinson recommends  that Bitcoin miners should switch to this PoUW protocol in order to minimize their carbon footprint, which is now comparable to the one left by small countries. Climate and Energy Implications of Crypto-Assets in the United States  https://t.co/SpHAyvnOwu A group of lawmakers from the White House has published a report made on the order of President Biden in March this year, related to the excessive usage of energy by various industries, including cryptocurrency mining. In a nutshell, the report recommends that if these industries cannot significantly decrease their energy consumption, they should be banned. A large carbon footprint left by Bitcoin blockchain has been an issue brought up many times by BTC critics. Recent reports state that the amount of energy used by BTC miners (the network runs on the PoW consensus protocol) is equal to that consumed by small countries around the world. With current rapidly rising prices for energy resources, this issue is becoming even more relevant.  The report recommends , though, that a switch to the proof-of-stake protocol for PoW blockchains would significantly reduce the amount of energy they utilize. Switching to alternative crypto-asset technologies such as Proof of Stake could dramatically reduce overall power usage to less than 1% of today’s levels. The aforementioned Cardano runs on this protocol, and Ethereum, the second biggest blockchain, is about to switch to PoW too. The long-expected Merge upgrade is to happen in roughly a week – between Sept. 15 and 20.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-says-bitcoin-should-adopt-cardanos-ofelimous-protocol-to-survive,utoday,2022-09-09,11:33:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here's What Cardano (ADA) Holders on Exchanges Can Do to Prepare Ahead of Vasil Hard Fork,"Cardano's Vasil  mainnet launch is scheduled to occur 13 days from now, on Sept. 22, to be precise. The upgrade hopes to onboard significant improvements using Cardano's hard fork combinator (HFC) approach and boost the network's performance by increasing throughput, script efficiency and reducing latency in block transmission. The hard fork combinator is designed to enable the combination of several protocols without having to make significant adjustments. In the case of Cardano, a hard fork combinator combines protocols without a system interruption or restart. Even though there is little chance of a system restart or interruption, Cardano (ADA) holders on exchanges should bear a few things in mind before and during the Vasil hard fork combinator event. Users should make sure their funds are in the right place at the appropriate time before the Vasil event. This entails deciding whether to keep the funds in a noncustodial wallet or leave them on an exchange, as some traders do. According to  Daniel Ribar  of IOG's Project Catalyst, Cardano (ADA) holders on exchanges should stay alert as it remains likely that ADA accounts on exchanges might go into maintenance mode for a few days, which implies that withdrawals or deposits might be temporarily suspended during this period. ⚠️ PSA: If you leave your  #ada  on exchanges during hard fork event coming up - it is likely that all  $ada  accounts there will go into maintenance mode for number of days. This means no withdrawals or deposits. Plan for it,  #Cardano . Therefore, if a user decides to keep his/her holdings on a centralized exchange or in a custodial wallet, the user should be fully aware that the provider is in charge. During the upgrade, trading platforms might temporarily suspend deposits and withdrawals and might even momentarily halt trades. Users who keep funds on an exchange should constantly be aware that their fate ultimately rests with the company. However, users who have decided to store their ADA coins in a noncustodial wallet should make sure they have access to their seed phrases or private keys. An individual is in complete control of their funds both before and after the Vasil HFC if they have their private keys. Last but not least, holders of Cardano on exchanges should be on the lookout for updates from the exchange during the Vasil event and leave time for any deposits or withdrawals in case there is a temporary freeze.",https://u.today/heres-what-cardano-ada-holders-on-exchanges-can-do-to-prepare-ahead-of-vasil-hard-fork,utoday,2022-09-09,14:23:00,en
cardano,No Section,Robinhood Working on Enabling Cardano (ADA) Transfers ,"Leading brokerage firm Robinhood  says  that it is working on enabling transfers for Cardano (ADA). As  reported by U.Today , Robinhood listed the ADA token on Sept. 1. Prior to that, the zero-fee brokerage service also added support for Solana (SOL), Compound (COMP), Polygon (POL) and several other cryptocurrencies. Robinhood launched Bitcoin transfers for all users in early July after originally starting testing the feature last September. Users are able to move their coins in and out of the platform. The company does not charge an additional commission for transferring crypto out of its platform. However, users are still required to pay network fees. Robinhood users are required to go through the process of identity verification by providing a photo of a government-issued ID or a driver's license in order to be able to move their coins.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Says He Cannot Force Vasil Hard Fork,"In a  recent tweet , Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson explained that he is not capable of forcing the Vasil hard fork in response to a critic, highlighting the blockchain’s decentralization. The much-anticipated upgrade is expected to occur on Sept. 22.   A Bitcoin maximalist, who goes by @btc_bryan_21, stated that Hoskinson could change the total supply of ADA tokens on a whim due to its alleged centralization. Cardano’s maximum supply is capped at 45 million ADA tokens, but the critic alleged that nothing would stop the crypto mogul from changing that, alleging that the blockchain’s monetary policy is very malleable. However, Hoskinson categorically rejected such an idea, adding that Bitcoin maximalists are “beyond stupid.” In July, the former Cardano founder also  said  that Bitcoin maxis are the most “toxic” and “useless” people to engage in response to former MicroStrategy CEO claiming that the ADA token is an unregistered security.    As  reported by U.Today , the Cardano has repeatedly opposed the idea of burning ADA tokens since all of them are actually in the hands of actual owners. This would be tantamount to stealing from the community, according to Hoskinson. Last September, he  compared  the idea of burning ADA to stealing food.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-says-he-cannot-force-vasil-hard-fork,utoday,2022-09-09,05:38:00,en

Charles Hoskinson Is Working on “Something Really Cool” in Papua New Guinea,"Creator of Input Output Global, the company which built Cardano blockchain,  Charles Hoskinson  has used his Twitter handle to say that he is currently in Papua New Guinea, “working on something really cool”. Hoskinson did not specify what exactly he is working on there but from past experience, it could be a new Cardano project. Who's in Papua New Guinea? Working on something really cool there Nearly a year ago, in October 2021, crypto mogul and mathematician Hoskinson undertook a tour around Africa, in which he visited several countries to make public speeches and support Cardano-based innovative projects on that continent. In his  “pan-African tour’ , as he referred to it, Hoskinson visited several African countries, including Nigeria and Zanzibar, met with presidents and high-ranking politicians and businessmen. Since then, Cardano has participated in investing in several African blockchain and fintech startups via Adaverse, an ecosystem accelerator built by Cardano to provide support to crypto startups in Africa. Among them was Afriguild, a local blockchain gaming guild and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). Afriguild then announced that its intention was to attract around  100 million Africans  into crypto and Web3. Overall, Hoskinson believes that in the near future Africa will become a continent with the highest blockchain and crypto adoption with lots of wealth generated from those. As reported by U.Today recently, Cardano participated in an  $11 million investment round  into African fintech firm Pezesha focused on microfinance and affordable loans to local SMEs.",https://u.today/is-cardano-expanding-charles-hoskinson-is-working-on-something-really-cool-in-papua-new-guinea,utoday,2022-09-10,09:15:00,en

Polkadot, on the other hand, has over 33,646 staked wallets (called Nominators) with a staking ratio of 52.4%, which reflects a relatively low level of decentralization. Avalanche has 22,890 individual staked wallets and a staking ratio of 64.9%, which is relatively higher compared to Polkadot's 52.4%. Compared to Polkadot, Avalanche has a high staking ratio despite having a small number of staked wallets. With a total of 998 validators, Polkadot has a small number of validators when compared to Cardano, which has over 3,202 stake pools/validator nodes. Polkadot validator nodes can be run by anyone, but there is a limit of 297 validators per era/epoch that can participate in the 24-hour validation. Public blockchains have been around for a while, yet none of them has been able to crack the puzzle of the blockchain trilemma so far. The blockchain trilemma refers to the problem in which a public blockchain will not be able to optimize for all three qualities: security, scalability and decentralization. Cardano's network is highly distributed and decentralized, which reduces its vulnerability to DDoS attacks. The comparatively small size of the Cardano full node and the low hardware requirements support its decentralization, which is reflected in the large number of stake pools and users running full nodes. Although the Cardano network exhibits a high level of security and decentralization, it falls short on the scalability benchmarks. At the beginning of 2022,  Cardano  listed 11 ways it intended to scale. The majority of these improvements are anticipated to be included in the upcoming  Vasil update  on Sept. 22.",https://u.today/cardano-outperforms-current-proof-of-stake-chains-report,utoday,2022-09-11,13:59:00,en

According to recent statistics by IOG, 1,093 projects are currently building on Cardano. Ninety-four projects have been launched on Cardano, while the number of Plutus scripts stood at 3,196. The Cardano network has now seen the minting of over six million native tokens across 61,314 minting policies. In late December 2021,  U.Today  reported the number of projects building on Cardano to be 178, with 13 projects having launched.  Fast-forward to January of this year, the number had jumped to 199, with Cardano creator, Charles Hoskinson, asking, ""who wanted to be project 200?."" Now, this number has grown, with more than a thousand projects building on the Cardano network. The Alonzo upgrade, which included smart contract capabilities, opened up a wide range of new opportunities for the creation of Cardano's decentralized applications (DApps), decentralized exchanges (DEXs), and decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions.  Alonzo established a multi-functional environment that enabled the development of smart contracts utilizing Plutus scripts and the native tokens introduced in Mary, building on earlier upgrades (Shelley, Allegra, and Mary).

As indicated in the weekly IOG report, it may take five days for Vasil's capability to be available on the mainnet. IOG states that Vasil capability will become available at the start of epoch 366 on Sept. 27. In advance of the hard fork, dApp projects, exchanges and SPOs keep updating their systems to maintain compatibility. The non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace Artano just published a blog post outlining its key development takeaways. The results of Artano's Vasil testing indicate a cost reduction of up to 76-77% and a transaction size reduction of up to 92%. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson, referring to the ""Artano post,"" hinted at the power of the incoming Vasil upgrade as that which would cause dApps to deploy. IOG earlier stated it would be tracking three critical mass indicators ahead of triggering the hard fork, which are: 75% of mainnet blocks being created by the final release candidates, roughly 25 exchanges upgraded (representing 80% of liquidity) and the top 10 dApps by TVL updated. In the recent IOG report on ecosystem readiness, 95% of mainnet blocks have already been created by Vasil node candidate 1.35.3, which indicates that the ""node readiness"" metric has already been met. Also, 50% of the top 12 exchanges by liquidity, namely Binance, MEXC, Bitrue, AAX, WhiteBIT and BKEX, have indicated Vasil readiness.

cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Works on “Something Really Cool,” Here’s Big “If” in LUNC Burning Mechanism: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today has prepared a summary of the top four news stories over the weekend. Don’t miss anything important in the crypto industry! In his Friday tweet, Cardano creator  Charles Hoskinson  informed his followers that he is currently in Papua New Guinea, “working on something really cool.” He did not provide any details on what exactly he is working on; however, judging by Hoskinson’s travels in the past, it could be a new Cardano project. Back in October 2021, the IOG co-founder went on a  “pan-African tour,”  visiting several African countries, including Nigeria and Zanzibar. Since then, Cardano has invested in several African blockchain and fintech start-ups, among which was Afriguild, a local blockchain gaming guild and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO). At the beginning of September, the crypto community witnessed the parabolic growth of  LUNC  ignited by a proposal to include a 1.2% burning fee on every transaction made on the network. If centralized exchanges accept the burning fee, the burning volume would exceed $4 million in a day, the proposal states. However, this is where potential problems for Luna appear. Binance has recently released a statement informing its users that it will not implement the fee, which puts the daily burning volume at only $55,000. For a project with a $3 billion market capitalization, less than $100,000 of daily burning volume is insignificant. Thus, LUNC’s rally was based on on-chain manipulation and a questionable proposal that will not have the desired effect on the token’s market value, considering the action that centralized exchanges are taking. SpendTheBits , a project built on the basis of XRP Ledger, has recently received great support from the entire XRP community thanks to its major development aimed at implementing Bitcoin transactions and competing with the Lightning Network. According to the project's team, the use of the XRPL blockchain allows BTC transactions to be much faster and cheaper. SpendTheBits’ most important feature is the use of XRP in transactions; in addition to the fact that XRP is used to activate an account, it will be burned with every BTC transaction through the XRP Ledger blockchain. Besides, CryptoLaw founder John Deaton noted that the case of SpendTheBits, which is built on  XRP Ledger  using open source code and not requiring Ripple’s permission to implement the technology, once again proves that the SEC’s claims against Ripple and XRP are absurd. According to a recent report on proof-of-stake chains,  Cardano  has over 1,182,080 staked wallets with a staking ratio of 72.63%, which reflects a high degree of decentralization. On the other hand, Polkadot has over 33,646 staked wallets (called Nominators) with a staking ratio of 52.4%, demonstrating a relatively low level of decentralization.

cardano,No Section,"Advantages of Genius X, World's First Multi-token ISPO, In Exclusive Interview with Genius Yield Team","Recently, I conducted an interview with  Genius Yield ’s co-founder and chief scientific officer, Marvin Bertin, and Head of Finance, Dikemba Balogu, CFA. We discussed the Genius DEX, the requirements for participating in  Genius X launchpad  and the advantages of the Cardano blockchain. If you want to know what ISPOs are and what is so special about Genius X multi-token ISPO, and what exactly our interviewees have in their crypto portfolio, don’t miss this piece! U.Today: Hello, Marvin and Dikemba. Can you tell us about your backgrounds and how you got interested in the crypto sphere? Dikemba Balogu:  I have a finance and capital markets background. I’ve worked in the investment industry in portfolio management, equity research and mutual fund research. I’ve also worked for multiple Fortune 500 companies in corporate finance in areas such as treasury, where I managed the balance sheet and cash flow needs of a company, and financial planning, where I created monthly budgets and multi-year financial forecasts. My interest in crypto grew because of the financial and economic implications of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Billions of dollars in untapped wealth could be brought into a global financial system that is interconnected and more accessible than the current financial system. Crypto is also a disruptive technology, decentralizing current power structures and giving individuals more control over their financial futures. We’ve already seen how crypto has completely disrupted the way the world previously handled cross-border payments and remittances for decades by giving users lower transaction fees and faster settlement times. My interest lies in crypto's future innovations that will happen in decentralized finance (DeFi), Web3 and many other applications. Marvin Bertin:  I have a background in machine learning/AI engineering, with years of experience working in biotech - specifically designing algorithms that can perform early cancer detection from sequenced DNA. I got started in crypto as a data science consultant on the Ethereum and Cosmos blockchains developing DeFi products for clients. I have in-depth knowledge of DEX architectures and ML-driven yield optimization strategies. U.Today: Can you share the concept of Genius Yield? What are the benefits of the platform? Marvin Bertin:  Genius Yield is a DeFi asset management solution implemented on the Cardano blockchain to provide superior yield optimization and high returns to users. Genius Yield has developed a concentrated liquidity DEX combined with an AI-powered Smart Liquidity Management protocol that algorithmically automates asset allocation to maximize users’ APYs while minimizing risk exposure. Dikemba Balogu:  The Genius DEX by Genius Yield will allow permissionless trading of thousands of digital assets. The Genius DEX uses an order-book model instead of the typical Automated Market Maker (AMM) model utilized by other DEXs such as Uniswap. The order-book model will enable more order types than an AMM DEX, such as stop-loss orders. In addition, liquidity providers on the Genius DEX can concentrate their liquidity across a desired range of prices, boosting capital efficiency without the effects of impermanent loss caused by the constant product market maker model used in most AMM DEXs.  Genius Yield is also developing an AI-powered Yield Optimizer that allows you to passively obtain interest as the optimizer actively manages your funds to obtain the highest risk-adjusted APY. When saving your funds, many users have little options to passively accumulate interest outside of the very low interest rates offered at banks or the buy-and-hold strategy with traditional securities. Depending on your country of residence, you may not have either of these options. The Smart Liquidity Management protocol provides a solution for those who want higher yields but may not have the time to actively manage their funds as a liquidity provider. U.Today: Thanks for the details. Why did you choose Cardano to build your platform on? Marvin Bertin:  Cardano has key protocol-level features and guarantees that make it stand out from all other blockchains. First, Cardano employs a unique ledger accounting architecture called EUTxO, which allows for parallelizable dApp architectures like the Genius DEX, leveraging a more efficient and expressive order book design. Second, Cardano smart contract uses Haskell - a functional programming language that reduce contract hacks and vulnerabilities via formal verification. Third, unlike EVM architecture, Cardano’s ledger can be easily sharded, allowing for an isomorphic Layer 2 to achieve exponential scaling. Also, Cardano is the most advanced and decentralized proof-of-stake blockchain in the world. With unique features like noncustodial staking, it is the basis of a revolutionary fundraising mechanism called Initial Stake Pool Offering. Dikemba Balogu:  In addition, Cardano is completely open source, and its technology, such as its delegated proof-of-stake mechanism, has all been peer-reviewed by professional third parties. In summary, Cardano stands out compared to other blockchains because of its EUTxO model that is built for scalability, its functional programming language that limits errors and its scientific, peer-reviewed methodology for development. These attributes can create a long-term competitive advantage compared to other blockchains.  U.Today: Genius X is an accelerator program and launchpad launched by Genius Yield. How does it work? How do you choose start-ups you are going to work with? Dikemba Balogu:  Since smart contract functionality came to Cardano in September 2021, there has been a surge of smart contract applications being built on the blockchain. Today, there are over 1,000 projects building on Cardano. Genius X is an accelerator program for projects building impactful solutions on Cardano. Through our network and expert team, we provide advising on token design, pitch deck presentation, legal entity set up, budgeting, product development, fundraising and much more. Genius X’s goal is to help these start-ups bring their products to market successfully. Genius X is selective about who joins its accelerator program. Start-ups have to fill out an application, have its founders’ work experience verified and undergo an interview process by our team before they are accepted into the program. We look for projects that are typically at the early stage of their development and have a proof of concept or minimum viable product. Today, Genius X has only accepted around a dozen projects. With thousands of projects building on Cardano, the community is finding it harder to assess the quality of each project. Genius X provides a solution for the community, seeking quality over quantity with our accelerator program. Genius X also has a launchpad, which allows projects to conduct a public sale of their tokens via an Initial DEX Offering (IDO) in conjunction with their token generation event. U.Today: You are launching a multi-token ISPO for selected start-ups built on Cardano. Could you please start by briefly explaining what ISPOs are? Marvin Bertin:  An ISPO, or Initial Stake Pool Offering, is a decentralized, permissionless funding mechanism that utilizes Cardano’s unique delegated proof-of-stake architecture. Normally, users delegate their ADA to stake pools and receive ADA staking rewards.  However, in an ISPO, instead of the delegator receiving ADA staking rewards, projects keep all of the staking rewards paid to their stake pool. These ADA staking rewards are used by the project to fund its development. In exchange for delegators giving up their staking rewards, the project gives them the native token that usually represents governance or utility in their project. In traditional finance, start-ups typically only get funding from venture capitalists or accredited individuals of high net worth. However, a defining characteristic of the ISPO is that it is open to everyone. It doesn’t matter whether you have only 20 ADA or 20,000 ADA, you can support a promising start-up. U.Today: How does your multi-token ISPO differ from other ISPOs? What’s so special about it? Dikemba Balogu:  In most ISPOs, a user delegates their ADA and receives that project’s token in exchange, based on a predetermined exchange formula. For delegators, this model has become problematic as the Cardano ecosystem has grown and there are multiple new ISPOs happening on a monthly basis. Many delegators would like to support multiple projects instead of just one at a time. The Genius X Multi-Token ISPO is a solution to this problem by allowing delegators to receive the tokens of multiple projects by delegating to only one ISPO. The multi-token ISPO allows delegators to maximize the value of their ADA by receiving the tokens of projects that are in the Genius X accelerator program. U.Today: Which start-ups will participate in your multi-token ISPO? Dikemba Balogu:  The five startups and their token allocations for the first cohort of the Genius X Multi-Token ISPO are: Smart Places - 900,000,000 $SMART tokens, Ledgity - 82,800,000 $LTY tokens, Outlaws Brawl - 300,000 $HYN tokens, Reach Metaverse - 16,650,000 $REACH tokens, and Drunken Dragon - 60,000,000 $DG tokens. Each startup can offer solutions or products that people can utilize and enjoy. U.Today: Do you have a crypto portfolio? Name the top three positions. Marvin Bertin:  ADA, BTC, ETH. Dikemba Balogu:  ADA, BTC, GALA. U.Today: Do you have a piece of advice for people who want to join the crypto space but don’t know where to start?

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder Talks About ""Key Cause"" of Market Sell-off, ADA Down 8%","Charles Hoskinson , the founder of Cardano, cites the primary reason for the sell-off — a high inflation report — while referring to a CNBC piece. A higher-than-anticipated reading for inflation was reported in the consumer price index data for August. Headline inflation increased 0.1% month over month, while monthly changes in core inflation were up 0.6%. On a year-over-year basis, inflation was 8.3%. I remember attending a dinner party in Abu Dhabi and sitting next to a famous economist who told me inflation had nothing to do with printing massive sums of money. The people in charge are a delusional cult. You get the bill  https://t.co/4DPpUUX9eH The markets plunged on Tuesday after a crucial August inflation report came in stronger than anticipated, which undermined investor hopes for a less aggressive Federal Reserve. In anticipation of a favorable report for August, Bitcoin (BTC) had gained 15% over the weekend. However, once the fresh data was made public, it fell by 4%. The S&P 500 dropped 2.4%, and the Nasdaq Composite sank more than 3%. The crypto market tumbled as well, and the majority of altcoins were recording losses at press time. The report is one of the last the Fed will see ahead of its Sept. 20-21 meeting, where the central bank is expected to decide its third consecutive 0.75 percentage point interest rate hike to tamp down inflation. The high inflation report from August could result in the Fed persisting in its aggressive hikes longer than some investors expected. As reported by  U.Today,  Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson spoke on the underperformance of cryptocurrencies in 2022 so far, claiming that markets are ""disconnected"" from reality. Hoskinson also commended other projects within the cryptocurrency industry, adding that many of them are ""solid"" even though present prices do not reflect that. The Cardano founder also highlighted the fact that the current market action was mainly driven by macro factors. The price of the ADA token has plunged by nearly 8% over the last 24 hours in tandem with other major cryptocurrencies.

Bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell 4% to reach lows near $21,000. As crypto traders hedge against the disappointment of the Merge, Ethereum Has seen a bigger decline, tumbling 6.90%. Avalanche, Cardano and Shiba Inu also recorded losses of the same magnitude, tumbling 8.42%, 6.42% and 8.56%, respectively. In August,  U.S. inflation  was stronger than anticipated, presumably keeping the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates by 75 basis points for the third time in a row. According to Labor Department data released Tuesday, the consumer price index gained 0.1% in July after remaining unchanged in June. Prices increased 8.3% from a year ago, a little slowdown. The so-called core CPI, which excludes the more erratic food and energy components, increased by 6.3% from a year earlier and 0.6% from July. All measures exceeded expectations, and with historically high and pervasive price pressures still present, the Fed's inflation objective is still a ways off. Chair Jerome Powell said last week that the central bank would act ""forthrightly"" to achieve price stability, and some policymakers voiced support for another historically large rate hike. Officials have said their decision next week will be based on the ""totality"" of the economic data they have on hand, which also illustrates a strong labor market and weakening consumer spending.

cardano,No Section,Here's Why Cardano Is Undervalued by Crypto Market,"Despite the progress made on Vasil hard fork and the long-awaited release date already officially announced,  Cardano's (ADA)  price is barely responding to the positive changes. Moreover, after the news of accelerating inflation in the U.S., implying even tighter regulation of monetary policy, ADA quotations fell more than all other cryptocurrencies from the top 10 by market capitalization. The apparent undervaluation is hinted at by the behavior of the ADA price, which in late August after the news of  Vasil hard fork  showed a growth of 23% in two weeks, but then gave up part of the growth, and now the result is only 9%. On the crypto market, where assets can increase and decrease in price by 10% several times a day, such values can hardly surprise anyone. It is strange that the price of the top eight projects with a capitalization of $16 billion hardly reacts to the news, where the identity ""buy on rumor, sell on fact"" works best. There is a possibility that Cardano and its event was left in the shadows of Ethereum with its transition to PoS, and ADA quotes will start to react to the Vasil hard fork closer to the date, which will be a week after the  Ethereum Merge . Either way, the reaction will occur before or after Vasil hard fork. It is hard to imagine that an update noticeably increasing the overall performance of  Cardano , the Plutus smart contract platform, and enabling the transfer of new token types from Ethereum to Cardano, will not affect the project's position.",https://u.today/heres-why-cardano-is-undervalued-by-crypto-market,utoday,2022-09-13,16:00:00,en

-September 19th - Mainnet update proposal needs to be submitted by this date to trigger HFC event on 22nd 
 
-September 22nd - Mainnet HFC event (era transitions from Alonzo -> Babbage) 
 
-September 27th - Plutus V2 Cost Model available on Mainnet #CardanoVasil Sept. 22 will also Usher in an era transition from Alonzo to Babbage. As reported by  U.Today , it may take five days for Vasil's capability to be available on the mainnet. IOG states that Vasil capability will become available at the start of epoch 366 on Sept. 27. The Plutus V2 Cost Model will also be available on the mainnet on this date. In the recent IOG report on ecosystem readiness, 97% of mainnet blocks have already been created by Vasil node candidate 1.35.3, which indicates that the ""node readiness"" metric has already been met. Also, seven of the top twelve exchanges by liquidity, namely Binance, Upbit, MEXC, Bitrue, AAX, WhiteBIT and BKEX, have indicated Vasil readiness. Coinbase and three other exchanges in the top twelve are currently updating their nodes. Eleven other exchanges have indicated Vasil readiness, while several others are in the process of updating their nodes.

As reported by U.Today, there’s been a massive uptick in the number of bots impersonating Buterin ahead of the hotly anticipated merge event. On Sunday, a Twitter account that belongs to a popular British radio station  was hacked  in order to promote an Ethereum giveaway scam. Plenty of other verified Twitter accounts have been hijacked, with fraudsters attempting to impersonate Buterin.

His different vision didn’t sit well with the other co-founder, which ultimately led to him leaving the organization in June 2014. After all these years, Hoskinson appears to have mended fences with Buterin. As  reported by U.Today , he said they both had grown “a lot” in 2021.    Buterin also acknowledged that Hoskinson’s projects had some “interesting ideas” even though he downplayed the importance of academic rigor.

cardano,No Section,Here's How Genius Yield ISPO Utilizes Cardano's Unique Proof-of-Stake Architecture: Interview with Genius Yield Team,"In U.Today's most recent  interview  with Genius Yield's co-founder and chief scientific officer Marvin Bertin, and Head of Finance Dikemba Balogu, CFA, our editor discussed what Genius DEX offers to experienced users in the blockchain space, Cardano blockchain's advantages and requirements for participating in the Genius X launchpad. While answering a question about Cardano, Marvin Betrin highlighted the key protocol-level features that make the network stand out from all other competitors. Foremost, Cardano utilizes a unique ledger architecture called EUTxo (Extended Unspent Transaction Output). The structure allows using parallelizable dApp architectures like Genius DEX to implement for an effective orderbook design. With the help of the Haskell programming language, the security of platforms like Genius DEX and the contracts they utilize can reach the next level. Unlike EVM architectures, Cardano scaling has always been a step ahead of the industry's standard as the network's ledger can be easily sharded, allowing usage of isomorphic Layer 2s for achieving exponential scaling. The Initial Stake Pool Offering is a permissionless funding mechanism that utilizes Cardano's delegated PoS architecture. In the interview, Betrin explained how this funding method differs from the normal delegation of  ADA  for staking rewards. In ISPO, instead of giving out  ADA  staking rewards to users, projects fund development and give delegators native tokens that represents the governance or utility of a decentralized application or a project in general. The Genius X multi-token ISPO offers exposure to multiple projects by delegating to only one ISPO, which maximizes the value of the provided funds by receiving tokens from projects in the Genius X accelerator program.",https://u.today/heres-how-genius-yield-ispo-utilizes-cardanos-unique-proof-of-stake-architecture-interview-with,utoday,2022-09-14,10:26:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano's Charles Hoskinson on Elon Musk's Twitter Deal: ""Shotgun Wedding"" Coming","Charles Hoskinson , the creator of IOG, the company that built Cardano blockchain, seems to be puzzled and surprised by the past intention of Elon Musk to lay his hands on Twitter for $44 billion. Hosk compared Musk's idea of buying out Twitter for $44 billion to a ""one night stand"" and then ""a shotgun wedding"" that would follow nine months later. Hoskinson likely implies that the announcement of the offer to buy Twitter and after that spreading the word about the approved deal was a moment of joy in public for Musk, which gave him a lot of points in the eyes of Tesla shareholders and those who respect Musk as an innovator and entrepreneur. Musk is the man who promised to ""save the freedom of speech"" by buying the social media giant. Twitter management was also happy to sell the company to the renowned entrepreneur. However, one night stands are often followed by a forced wedding over the next nine months before a baby is born. Now, Musk is trying to cancel his Twitter deal, as if trying to escape from the wedding, and his legal team is defending him in court from the ""shotgun wedding"" that Twitter insists on. The Elon Musk/Twitter buyout is the equivalent of a one night stand followed by a shotgun wedding nine months later. I've never seen anything like it In early July, Hoskinson tweeted on the same subject that Elon ""must have issues pulling out"" of the deal with Twitter. The reason for the pullout by the innovative centibillionaire is that he claimed Twitter failed to present him with adequate data on the percentage of actual users on Twitter versus spam bots. Prior to that, Hoskinson suggested  building a brand new decentralized social media  platform where Musk could move should his Twitter deal fail. The issue of spam bots since then has been a frequent subject of discussion on the Tesla CEO's Twitter page. Binance's CZ and Dogecoin cofounder Billy Markus joined him in those. Earlier today, Markus toyed with the idea of  deleting all social media platforms  rather than trying to improve them, which he obviously believes to be useless. In a recent tweet, the Tesla boss stated that his tweets are being suppressed. He tagged the accounts of Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and the Twitter support teams asking them to handle this issue. DOGE co-creator Markus commented, saying that crypto scam spammers ransack his tweets, and that could be the reason why the Twitter algorithm also suppresses his posts. mine are being ransacked by crypto scam spammers, which probably makes the algorithm suppress the tweets

The latter is a vocal Bitcoin maximalist, and the article he posted is on how Bitcoiners view the proof-of-stake algorithm. BTC runs on proof of work. Hoskinson believes that, now, Bitcoin maxis will start attacking Cardano. Now begins the Era of everyone assuming that all Proof of Stake works like Ethereum's Proof of Stake. The maxis will attack Cardano for slashing and label all the ethereum problems as ours. Thanks Jack  https://t.co/XpL4OynoeM Hoskinson commented on an article published in late August by a Bitcoin maxi, in which he explains to Bitcoiners how proof of stake works, saying that it is important to know that for future narrative battles in order to be able to ""punch back"" at the ETH community. Once Ethereum cleanses itself of the “dirty” and “wasteful” externalities from PoW, we can expect the gloves to come off in the narrative war, and I think Bitcoiners should be ready to punch back. Among other stones thrown at Ethereum and the proof-of-stake algorithm, the author names the fact that PoS is based on a ""negative (penalty-based) incentive system."" Among the things these penalties are given for is ""slashing."" This is when a miner’s stake in ETH gets slashed for creating ambiguity on the network or by being inactive. Hoskinson stated that Cardano must not be blamed for Ethereum's PoS problems only because both chains now run on the same consensus algorithm. Dogecoin cofounder Billy Markus assured Hoskinson that he should not worry about what he wrote in his tweet since the majority of crypto users do not understand how PoS and PoW works, though many pretend to. don’t worry, there’s like 8 people out of the millions of people in cryptocurrency who truly actually understand anything 
 
there are millions of people who pretend to tho In a video  published earlier today on Twitter, the Cardano founder congratulated the Ethereum community on this achievement – the long-expected Merge in which PoS is implemented. He compared the switch to the Merge to changing the engine of a car as it continues going at full speed without slowing down the work of the blockchain or any disruption of service to the centibillinial ecosystem of ETH users. He admitted that a lot of hard work had been done to conduct that transition. According to him, the Merge is one of the hardest things that has ever been done in the crypto space. Hoskinson stated that, as he found in another source, the switch to proof-of-stake from PoW will help the global consumption of energy to drop by 0.2%. Vitalik Buterin also tweeted the same data, but he cited Ethereum researcher Justin Drake as the author. The Merge finally took place  earlier today, on Sept. 15. The block height is currently 15537393. After the transition finally took place, Buterin tweeted about that and congratulated the community on the successful completion of the Merge.

cardano,No Section,Cardano’s Charles Hoskinson Addresses Jack Dorsey’s Criticism of Proof-of-Stake,"Cardano creator  Charles Hoskinson  urged former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey not to paint all proof-of-stake protocols with a broad brush. Hoskinson says that the Substack post that he published on his profile will make Bitcoin maximalists believe that the Cardano blockchain also has slashing, a feature that makes it possible to penalize bad actors in order to disincentivize other actors from behaving maliciously.   The ability to use economic penalties to 51% of attacks more expensive is believed to be one of the main benefits of the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. However, Bitcoin proponents view this negative incentive system as a major downside. It is worth noting that Cardano’s implementation of proof-of-stake doesn’t require slashing. The blockchain has a unique reward-sharing scheme that incentivizes shareholders to behave rationally. Distributing the supply of  ADA  to holders through free market dynamics enhances the blockchain’s decentralization, thus making it more resistant to attack.          A successful attack on  Cardano  would require someone to hold the majority of all staked coins in order to have dominance in the network consensus, which would make it extremely costly. Hence, irrational malignant actors are highly likely to be able to form only a marginal group. If a pool operator goes rogue, delegators will simply abandon him or her, making sure that a bad pool won’t be selected for making new blocks.      Moreover, malicious actors would get financially drained anyway, which is why slashing wouldn’t be able to prevent such an attack.",https://u.today/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-addresses-jack-dorseys-criticism-of-proof-of-stake,utoday,2022-09-15,06:08:00,en

As reported by Bloomberg, a Seoul court has issued an arrest warrant against  Terra founder Do Kwon  as he was accused of violating capital market rules. Apart from Kwon, five other individuals are about to be brought to justice as well. The warrant followed after several Terraform Labs employees were prohibited from leaving South Korea in June amid an investigation into the implosion of the Terra project. In July, investigators also raided local cryptocurrency exchanges as part of the probe. At the moment, all six individuals are located in Singapore. According to South Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo, local prosecutors plan to work with Interpol in order to carry out these arrests within a year. With an influx of spam bots impersonating various crypto influencers, developers and CEOs on Twitter, more and more bellwethers of the industry took notice of the issue, and  Charles Hoskinson  is no exception. In a recent tweet, Cardano founder shared a screenshot showing a notification about a fake Vitalik Buterin now following him on Twitter. Hoskinson reacted with a laugh-it-off attitude, saying that the real Buterin will never become his follower. The reason behind it is a history of feuding between the founders of the two biggest blockchains. Being once a part of Ethereum’s team, Hoskinson could not agree with Buterin on the structure of the project. Buterin wanted Ethereum to be a nonprofit entity, while Hoskinson saw it as a for-profit organization. Later, Hoskinson left the project after having a falling-out with the other-co-founders. Data provided by CoinMarketCap’s market analysis shows that in August,  Shiba Inu  has become one of the most viewed crypto assets for users on all continents of the world (except Antarctica!). The conclusion is based on the number of views of the Shiba Inu page directly on CoinMarketCap. The Dogecoin competitor is the third most popular cryptocurrency across North America, South America, Asia and Africa, trailing only market leaders like Bitcoin and Ethereum. In Oceania and Europe, Shiba Inu gives way to Terra Classic too, which is probably due to the pump of LUNC quotes in the last weeks of August. The study also notes that Shiba Inu remains one of the most watched coins regardless of crypto market conditions in July and August. The cause of undying interest in SHIB is its team working on a number of projects that should take the ecosystem to a whole new level. According to Twitter user ""Light,"" one of the most successful prop traders, the  Luna Classic  team is working against its supporters, and the latest pump confirms it. While every large tech stock on the NASDAQ closed the day in the red due to the market turmoil caused by high inflation data revealed in the recent CPI report, LUNC ignored the correction. Instead, the asset spiked by more than 30% in 24 hours, making investors feel safe and confident in the fundamental strength of the project. However, there’s a catch. Light claims that the LUNC team chose a common and efficient advertising strategy: add liquidity and funding to the asset to push its price higher than the market. The day after the pump, LUNC lost more than 25% of its value, making the 30% rally unproductive.",https://u.today/terras-do-kwon-faces-arrest-warrant-shib-is-one-of-most-viewed-assets-worldwide-lunc-31-pump,utoday,2022-09-15,15:35:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here's How Cardano Will Benefit from Vasil Hard Fork,"Tim Harrison, vice president of Community and Ecosystem at Cardano builder Input Output, claims that the upcoming Vasil hard fork  will “significantly” improve  the capabilities of the leading proof-of-stake blockchain. The upgrade will be able to enhance smart contract capabilities with the help of Plutus V2 scripts that will introduce higher throughput and greater efficiency. Reference inputs will make it possible to share data on-chain, thus avoiding taking any additional steps. Such an upgrade will be useful for oracles, according to Harrison. The implementation of inline datums lets developers create scripts and attach them directly to output, thus eliminating the need for hashes. After the implementation of the Alonzo hard fork last September, big scrips caused processing issues. The  Vasil  upgrade will introduce reference scrips that makes it possible for developers not to include a script in a spending transaction. At the same time, diffusion pipelining will ensure faster block propagation, thus significantly improving the blockchain’s performance by enabling higher throughput. When it comes to decentralization, the Vasil hard fork will completely remove the d parameter, which will make it impossible to start re-federation. As  reported by U.Today , the Vasil hard fork is scheduled to go live on Sept. 22 after months of delays caused by technical issues.",https://u.today/heres-how-cardano-will-benefit-from-vasil-hard-fork,utoday,2022-09-16,18:46:00,en

It says that the withdrawal of staked ETH will only be possible when the next ETH upgrade on the path toward Ethereum 2.0 — Shanghai — takes place. The message says that Shanghai is expected approximately six months after the completion of the Merge. It also indicates that this is not a particular requirement or policy of the Kraken exchange but rather it is to do with the way the whole Ethereum network operates. If only there was a way of implementing proof of stake that doesn't require locking assets like this.....  https://t.co/FldEPOfIau Charles Hoskinson did not share that Cardano's proof-of-stake model operates in a different way from Ethereum's; some of the commentators did it instead. Answering the questions of those who are not in the know, they tweeted that staking on Cardano does not require stakers to move ADA from their wallets and, therefore, ADA can be unstaked any time they want. In Cardano it's called delegation. Tokens are delegated to a Stake Pool Operator (SPO). The tokens NEVER leave your wallet and they can be unstaked any time you want. On Sept. 15, when Ethereum devs implemented the Merge upgrade and shifted Ethereum from PoW to PoS, Hoskinson responded to a tweet by Bitcoiner and  former Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey , who published an article that stated that all PoS platforms use proof of stake in the same way with many things that harm users' interests. In particular, the article mentioned a feature called  ""slashing"" used by Ethereum . This feature protects the network from 51-percent attacks by cutting down the financial stimulus of those stakers who try to behave maliciously. Basically, they get their staked Ethereum slashed, i.e., reduced. Cardano does not have such a feature; however, the article did not mention that. Hoskinson shared his expectation that now Bitcoin maximalists will begin attacking Cardano for the faults of Ethereum, thinking that PoS works on all platforms in the same way.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-criticizes-ethereums-pos-as-kraken-refuses-to-unstake-eth-until-shanghai-upgrade,utoday,2022-09-16,11:07:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano: IOG Shares Latest on Vasil and What To Expect After,"The much anticipated  Vasil upgrade  is now a little under one week away from its deployment on the mainnet. In addition to the new Plutus v2 features, the update aims to increase and improve Cardano's capabilities. Diffusion pipelining would be implemented with the goal of maximizing network capacity and throughput. On Sept. 22, a collaborative IOG/Cardano Foundation team will implement Vasil at the protocol level using the hard fork combinator. One epoch later, on Sept. 27, developers will be able to use the new features (including node and CLI support for reference inputs, inline datums, reference scripts and collateral outputs), along with the new Plutus cost model. Here's a post from me on how the  #Vasil  upgrade will make  #Cardano  (a highly decentralized, no slashing, no-lock-up-highly-liquid  #ProofOfStake  smart contract platform built for the many not the few by the way) even better…  https://t.co/BCuWGrVduS IOG  says it is currently tracking against three metrics: node, exchange and dApps readiness. The SPO community was the first to tick readiness with 98% of blocks currently being created by the Vasil 1.35.3 node, much exceeding the minimum 75% criterion established. Also, exchange liquidity is close to 60%, and several of the top exchanges have been confirmed ready or are in the process of upgrading. The Cardano Foundation exchange team expects that this figure will be close to the 80% threshold by the time of the upgrade. Users who hold their ADA on exchanges may experience service interruption if their preferred exchange has not updated their system at the time of the network upgrade. According to IOG, it has been closely collaborating with a number of top dApp projects to monitor their preparedness, and right now the numbers are promising. The technical community recently conducted a vote to determine whether they were prepared for Sept. 22. Given the positive feedback, the mainnet upgrade date was set. IOG states that a few things must occur before the scheduled hard fork. Early Vasil testing required the creation of the Vasil devnet, which has since been deprecated. The community's agile development platform moving forward will be the new preview environment, with the preproduction environment more closely resembling the mainnet. Before hard forking the mainnet, an upgrade to the preproduction environment must be successful. IOG goes on to discuss the deployment schedule. The preproduction environment will hard fork to the Vasil/Babbage era on Sept. 19. The Vasil mainnet upgrade proposal must be submitted by this date as well. The mainnet hard fork event is scheduled for Sept. 22. On Sept. 24, the new Plutus functionality and cost model will be made available in the preproduction environment and will be live on the mainnet by Sept. 27.",https://u.today/cardano-iog-shares-latest-on-vasil-and-what-to-expect-after,utoday,2022-09-17,15:55:00,en

As of the moment, over 50,033,448 transactions have been executed, according to Cardanoscan.io. Congratulations to 50 million transactions  #Cardano . 🥳  pic.twitter.com/dNGi4KUqQJ In early June, after the announcement regarding the Vasil upgrade was made, the number of transactions was given as 42.5 million by the Cardano foundation, which was reported by  U.Today . Now, this number has grown by almost 8 million. The Vasil hard fork was originally scheduled to launch in late June but was postponed then based on the need for further testing. In late June, Input Output, the Cardano blockchain builder, made a statement announcing the start of the countdown for the Vasil network upgrade following the release of the Vasil node 1.35.0. The IOG team hard forked the testnet to Vasil functionality on July 3 and hence testing continued. The  Vasil hard fork  is scheduled to run on the mainnet on Sept. 22 and is expected to considerably increase transaction volume. The Vasil update remains in the final mile. As reported by  U.Today , there are crucial dates to note. First, on Sept. 19, the mainnet update proposal is expected to be submitted to trigger the hard fork event on Sept. 22, which will also usher in an era of transition from Alonzo to Babbage. It may take five days for Vasil's capability to be available on the mainnet as IOG states that Vasil's capability will become available at the start of epoch 366 on Sept. 27. The Plutus V2 cost model will also be available on the mainnet on this date. In the recent IOG report on ecosystem readiness, 98% of mainnet blocks have already been created by Vasil node candidate 1.35.3, which indicates that the ""node readiness"" metric has already been met. Also, seven of the top twelve exchanges by liquidity, namely Binance, Upbit, MEXC, Bitrue, AAX, WhiteBIT and BKEX, have indicated Vasil readiness.",https://u.today/cardano-records-millions-more-in-transactions-since-vasil-announcement,utoday,2022-09-17,09:38:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano's Transaction Chaining Improves Network's Decentralization, Here's How","Cardano's eUTXO model is what makes the network different from such blockchains as  Ethereum  as all transactions occur in parallel to each other, which is why there is a fair share of difficulties for dApps, and solutions like  transaction chaining  are here to solve those issues. At first, decentralized Cardano applications like Minswap or SundaeSwap used the ""batching"" solution, where off-chain sequencers aggregated a number of UTXOs prior to submitting them on chain and executing. While this solution indeed solves a series of issues tied to the eUTXO model, it brings numerous risks like centralization, custodiality and batcher executable value, which can be used for sandwich attacks on users. The new solution adds another vertical where UTXOs are not batched off-chain but ordered virtually in a ""first-come-first-served"" manner. The transaction chain functions publicly and visibly in a decentralized way. The chain can be accessed by anyone without the limitation on who can consume which UTXO. Additionally, transaction chaining adds another vertical that decreases latency in the processing of orders. The application assumes that orders will make it on-chain and will be reverted without any loss if something goes wrong. First and foremost, the transaction submission to the mempool is done, which verifies its correctness. After this happens, users' transactions are associated with a particular UTXO, which protects the users' transaction and reverts it if something goes wrong. Essentially, the new solution may solve most problems Cardano-based DEXs and other decentralized applications are facing today, which is extremely relevant while the project's biggest competitor, Ethereum, is facing potential regulatory issues after switching to a  PoS consensus algorithm .",https://u.today/cardanos-transaction-chaining-improves-networks-decentralization-heres-how,utoday,2022-09-17,11:39:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Says Ethereum Becomes Hotel California of Crypto - “We All Just Prisoners Here”, the Song Goes","Creator of IOG, the company which built  Cardano  blockchain, has taken to Twitter to highlight the issue of the way Ethereum has implemented the Proof-of-Stake consensus protocol, which does not require as much energy for supporting a chain as Proof-of-Work does. Charles Hoskinson has referred to Ethereum, which he once helped to found, the Hotel California of the crypto space. In his tweet, Hoskinson has commented on the fact that Kraken does  not allow users to withdraw their staked Ethereum  tokens, saying that their ETH is unavailable to take out until the next scheduled Ethereum upgrade called Shanghai, which is due in about half a year after Merge. Kraken support service stated that this restriction does not come from the exchange but from Ethereum blockchain. This is the second time Cardano founder has commented on this, his first tweet about this on Friday, hinting that there is another way of implementing the Proof-of-Stake protocol. Cardano’ PoS does not require getting users’ ADA locked, since they are staked without leaving a user’s wallet and can be withdrawn at any time. Now, Hoskinson has compared Ethereum to the classic song “The Hotel California” by the Eagles band. Ethereum is becoming the Hotel California of Crypto  https://t.co/oRUw4kxvfS 'We are all just prisoners here of our own device"" , the song says. “Last thing I remember, I was Running for the door I had to find the passage back To the place I was before ""Relax, "" said the night man ""We are programmed to receive You can check out any time you like But you can never leave” However, in the comment thread, a Twitter user @StakeWithPride shared screenshots from Discord, saying that there is no ETA (estimated time of arrival) for ETH withdrawals and they are not scheduled for Shanghai. On these screenshots, Micah Zoltu, founder of Serv.eth Support, says that the information about withdrawals opening only after the Shanghai upgrade comes from exchanges. However, he does admit that they believe allowing investors “to withdraw in 2023, rather than in 2024” to be so important at this stage. Earlier, @StakeWithPride shared another screenshot from a conversation with Zoltu, where the latter explained that since Ethereum stakers are wealthy and can afford to buy expensive specialized hardware, they do not need to withdraw their ETH right away and can wait until later. Thus “needs of users” are getting prioritized over the needs of stakers here. On that, Hoskinson said that those who stake on Cardano’s PoS protocol are ordinary people, who do not have to be wealthy to participate in Cardano staking. He emphasized that here lies the important difference between Ethereum and Cardano. Stakers on Cardano are everyday people who don't need to be wealthy. I guess that's the philosophical difference  https://t.co/ScJ6hZKlMi",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-says-ethereum-becomes-hotel-california-of-crypto-we-all-just-prisoners-here-the,utoday,2022-09-17,10:19:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano’s Vasil Hard Fork Enters Final Stage,"Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson  has announced  that a hard fork combinator request has been submitted and successfully accepted, meaning that the implementation of the Vasil hard fork has now entered its final stage. An automated process of upgrading Cardano to the Vasil era has already started, according to Hoskinson. “We all gonna sit back and watch the Vasil rocket take off. It’s in the air right now…There’s no going back now. It’s been initiated” he said. The hard fork is scheduled to go live on Sept. 22 after months of anticipation. Hoskinson has urged the community to upgrade to  Daedalus 5.0.0 , the latest version of the wallet that contains some notable fixes. As  reported by U.Today , the Vasil hard fork is Cardano’s most ambitious upgrade to date since it will dramatically improve the blockchain’s scalability. For instance, Plutus V2 scripts will be able to dramatically enhance Cardano’s smart contract capabilities. Hoskinson claims that the upgrade is “particularly special” because it is named after his “good friend” Vasil Dabov. The Bulgarian mathematician, who was an active member of the Cardano community, passed away last December. “I’m glad that we're able to immortalize his legacy forever in the Cardano ecosystem,” Hoskinson said. He has noted that Cardano is “one of the strongest” cryptocurrencies in the space, and he expects the project to exit the year “very strong.”",https://u.today/cardanos-vasil-hard-fork-enters-final-stage,utoday,2022-09-18,07:51:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Critic Mike Alfred Might Have Left Coded Message on ADA Price in Tweet,"Cardano critic  Mike Alfred  might have unknowingly left a coded message on ADA's price per a recent tweet. In his usual manner of taunting the blockchain, Alfred referred to the key support at $0.45, from where ADA has rebounded a couple of times since July. The BTC maxi highlighted the potential for growth from this key level as long as ADA holds up above this point. Cardano has been bouncing around 45 cents for months. It appears to have found a permanent home at this level. The good news is that if it can hold up here for the next 15 years, it should give the protocol enough time to grow in to its outsized valuation. May be wishful thinking In previous instances, ADA rose 23%, from July 18 lows of near $0.45 to reach highs of $0.548 on July 20. Another instance is seen when Cardano gained 21% when it rose from July 26 lows of $0.45 to reach highs of $0.555 on July 30. This month, Cardano rallied 16% from Sept. 7 lows of $0.453 to reach highs of $0.524 on Sept. 10. Currently, Cardano seeks a continuation of its rebound from Sept. 16 lows of $0.454. At the time of publication, Cardano was trading marginally down at $0.476 with bears attempting to build upon their advantage. If the price slips and sustains below $0.45, the ADA price might seek support next at $0.42. While the $0.45 support offers the same potential for further price growth as in the past, bulls must break through $0.524 and $0.594 to take the initiative. However, the cryptocurrency markets, which have been tightly correlated in 2022, are not likely to fare well given the gloomy forecast for the equity markets. As reported by  U.Today , Charles Hoskinson, the creator of Cardano, said that the cryptocurrency ""has never been stronger,"" but the reality is not always represented in the markets, which are currently driven by ""macro factors."" Tim Harrison , VP of Ecosystem and Community at IOG, tweeted about the progress made so far on Vasil as it approaches the final mile.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Reached Its Bottom, 3 Ways It Can Recover: Crypto Market Review, September 20","The cryptocurrency market remains in a heavy knockout following the massive correction that began after the successful Merge update. The Merge sent most digital assets to their local lows we saw back in June. Luckily, some assets, like  Cardano , are showing a lot of strength against Bitcoin, which is a mandatory requirement for a reversal against USD. In September, ADA broke through the upper border of the ascending triangle against Bitcoin, which should have led to a volatile and liquid rally against the first cryptocurrency. Unfortunately, the fundamental factors we have mentioned before prevail over speculative interest, which is why a reversal did not happen. Additionally, Bitcoin's strengthening is a bearish signal for altcoins despite increased inflows into the industry in general. Previously, we mentioned that the first cryptocurrency will most likely start moving upward as dominance on the market reaches the lower border of the range. Despite the prediction made recently by prominent analyst and creator of one of the biggest derivatives trading platforms on the market, Arthur Hayes,  Ethereum  is rapidly losing most of its value after the successful switch to the PoS consensus algorithm. The main reason is the unexpected influx of regulatory pressure considering the fundamental shift in Ethereum's structure that makes it look like a security. In all fairness, Ethereum's validator does act like a shareholder, and a potential 51% attack is intrinsically the same as being a majority shareholder. However, the short-term picture is mostly fueled by the lack of inflows into the market, and strict monetary policy has nothing to do with Ethereum's future potential as the Merge changes the way the network works in general. Long-term predictions from various financial institutions and experts like Hayes remain bullish, as Ethereum's staking options may actually become a blockchain-based alternative to bank deposits in the future. Despite the recovery from $18,200 back above $19,000, Bitcoin's placement on the market is still problematic as the digital gold isfacing an enormous macro pressure that may get worse tomorrow if the Fed proceeds with a 100 bp rate hike after unexpectedly high inflation numbers. Unfortunately, the Ethereum Merge did not bring tons of inflows to the cryptocurrency market, which is why the lack of momentum is something one would easily expect after the strongest tightening of monetary policy in the United States in the last 20 years. The U.S. dollar's movement is yet another confirmation of this thesis as the currency shows strong performance against foreign currencies, which is another factor that pushes the price of the first  cryptocurrency  down today. At press time, Bitcoin is trading at $19,000 and actively testing the psychological support level which, if broken, might be the start of yet another correction below June's levels.",https://u.today/cardano-reached-its-bottom-3-ways-it-can-recover-crypto-market-review-september-20,utoday,2022-09-20,14:59:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Vasil Update: Cardano DEX TVL up by 565,000% Just Days After Launch","According to the DeFi data tracker  DefiLlama , Aada Finance, a noncustodial lending protocol on the Cardano mainnet, has recorded astonishing growth in Total Value Locked (TVL). At the time of publication, Aada Finance was demonstrating a growth of +565,873% in the last seven days. Aada Finance, a first-of-its-kind platform that allows lending and borrowing of native Cardano assets, launched on the Cardano mainnet seven days ago, precisely on Sept. 13, after months of public testnet use. Aada claims its V1 protocol launch aligns perfectly with pre-Vasil hard fork sentiment, hence the reason it chose to launch ahead of the much-anticipated upgrade. At the time of publication, Cardano's TVL was facing a slight decrease of 1.19% in the last 24 hours to stand at 79.58 million (without the inclusion of staking). However, with staking, the TVL is recorded at 97.9 million. The overall value of crypto assets placed in a decentralized finance (DeFi) system — or DeFi protocols in general — is referred to as total value locked (TVL). Minswap is the largest of the Cardano decentralized exchanges tracked by DefiLlama. With approximately $41.47 million in TVL, Minswap retains 42.36% market dominance. Cardano is fast approaching the Vasil upgrade, which aims to bring increased functionality, performance, scalability and interoperability to the blockchain through new features and improvements. The hard fork combinator event is scheduled to launch on Sept. 22, while Vasil functionality becomes available on Sept. 27, which is one epoch after the hard fork. According to updates provided by IOG, 99% of mainnet blocks are now being created by the Vasil node (1.35.3). The top Cardano dApps have confirmed testing and readiness. Meanwhile, top exchanges continue to make good progress on their updates, with 8 out of the top 12 exchanges by liquidity indicating readiness.",https://u.today/vasil-update-cardano-dex-tvl-up-by-565000-just-days-after-launch,utoday,2022-09-20,14:46:00,en
cardano,No Section,ADA Records 43% Increase in Trading Volume as Vasil Draws Traders' Attention,"According to  CoinMarketCap  data, Cardano (ADA) is also demonstrating a 43% rise in trading volumes in the last 24 hours. A total of 1.7 billion ADA, or 1,767,195,506 worth $789,962,746, have been swapped within the last 24 hours. An increase in trading volumes may suggest interest in a particular project. The rise in trading volumes comes less than 24 hours before the much-anticipated Cardano Vasil upgrade, scheduled for Sept. 22. Vasil hopes to bring a variety of improvements, among which are Plutus script enhancements and collateral change addresses, as well as to usher in important scaling updates such as diffusion pipelining. Because of the perception that Cardano's smart contract capabilities fall short of those of Ethereum and other Layer 1 blockchains with decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems, the platform is occasionally criticized for this reason. Cardano is built on the ""unspent transaction output"" (UTXO) system associated with Bitcoin, a method of determining what is kept in users' wallets by keeping track of the change left over when coins are spent, in contrast to Ethereum, which employs an account-based model similar to a bank's. At the time of publication, ADA's price had mildly rebounded, trading up 2.15% in the last 24 hours at $0.45. Cardano (ADA) has been trading below the moving averages for the past few weeks. Attempts by bulls to push the price above the MA 50 near $0.49 on Sept. 18 were rebuffed by bears. If the price gets propped up by a positive catalyst such as the Vasil upgrade and the price pushes above the MA 50 barrier once more, the bears may again attempt to pose another challenge at $0.64. If bulls overcome this barrier, ADA may indicate the start of a new uptrend. On Wednesday, the cryptocurrency market appeared to be moving in line with traditional markets, where investors were mostly staying on the sidelines ahead of the pivotal Fed meeting in which it would make an announcement on the rate hike. According to analysts, if the Fed sticks to its predicted course and increases borrowing costs by three-quarters of a percentage point, the markets may momentarily sigh with relief. However, a larger 1% hike to combat inflation may put more pressure on riskier assets by affecting liquidity.",https://u.today/ada-records-43-increase-in-trading-volume-as-vasil-draws-traders-attention,utoday,2022-09-21,16:15:00,en

Top exchanges have indicated support, as well as several dApps.  Ledger , the cryptocurrency hardware wallet provider, has indicated readiness for the Vasil upgrade scheduled for Sept. 22. 👋Hey  #Cardano   $ADA  users!

Any 🤔 Comment 👇 
 
Onwards! Ledger  has always expressed support for the Cardano blockchain, so its indication of Vasil's readiness comes as no surprise. In July, Ledger Live announced support for 100 more Cardano-based tokens. In June, Cardano made its way to Ledger Live, thus enabling users to send, receive, buy and manage ADA directly with Ledger Live. The release of the smart contract-compatible Cardano app version 4.0.0 for Ledger wallets was also announced in April. Aside from this, Cardano (ADA) ledger accounts are also  supported  on iOS and Android mobile phones. Coincidentally, Vasil arrives in the month of Cardano's fifth anniversary and Alonzo's first anniversary. As stated above, Vasil is expected to launch on Sept. 22, while the new Vasil capabilities are expected to be available exactly one epoch after the hard fork, on Sept. 27. Vasil hopes to bring a variety of improvements, among which are Plutus script enhancements, collateral change addresses and diffusion pipelining. Plutus Core is a scripting language used in the Cardano ledger. Vasil introduces a new version of Plutus Core (Plutus V2), a tuned Plutus interpreter, and new cost models for both Plutus V1 and Plutus V2 scripts. Diffusion pipelining aims at improving block propagation times and enabling higher throughput. This would ensure that blocks can be shared with at least 95% of peers within a few seconds of creation. ""Collateral"" is the number of funds charged for phase two script validation. With the Vasil upgrade, developers will be able to create a separate address to receive the change that would result in a case of phase two transaction validation failure.",https://u.today/cardanos-vasil-now-24-hours-away-hardware-wallet-ledger-announces-support,utoday,2022-09-21,11:45:00,en

According to data from crypto staking data provider Staking Rewards, Cardano has a total staked value of over $11.37 billion, compared to BNB Chain, which had a value of over $5.18 billion. Ethereum remained at the top with $19.75 billion, while Solana and Avalanche took the second and fifth spots, respectively. Users often compare total value locked (TVL), which refers to the overall value of crypto assets placed in a decentralized finance (DeFi) system — or DeFi protocols in general — with staked value. The parameters for staked value and TVL are ""completely different,"" according to Staking Rewards, as the latter might also include assets that are locked in decentralized finance protocols for functions like lending. At the time of publication, Cardano's TVL was facing a slight increase of 0.92% in the last 24 hours to stand at $80.85 million. As reported by  U.Today , Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson claims that Cardano's total value locked (TVL) is small since staked coins are not included. Users are not required to lock ADA tokens in order to stake them. If they were included, the blockchain's TVL would be in the range of billions. This would place it among one of the largest DeFi platforms. However, popular decentralized finance TVL aggregator DefiLlama stated that it does not count native staking at all. If native asset staking were to be included, maybe Cardano's TVL would be around the $11 billion range at present.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-surpasses-bnb-and-avalanche-with-1194-billion-staked,utoday,2022-09-21,14:37:00,en

Since the opening of the trading session today, the price of ADA managed both to fall by 1% and to grow by more than 4.7%. Trading activity in ADA is also evidenced by an increase in trading volume of nearly 40%, according to  CoinMarketCap . In the general picture, cryptocurrency quotes are revolving around the price level of $0.455, a break and fixing at which could raise the price of ADA up to $0.6. During the day, the  ADA price  was already climbing above the level, but it failed to consolidate and went down, which makes it clear that this was most likely a false break. Nevertheless, the quotes are not far away from the level, and their location close to $0.455 hints at the possibility of a retest of the level. This should be facilitated by Vasil hard fork, the successful implementation of which could boost quotations. The Vasil hard fork update, named after an acclaimed Cardano community member and blockchain developer, will take place today in the 365 epoch.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Remains in Green as Market Keeps on Bleeding, Here's Why: Crypto Market Review, September 23","Despite the mild recovery we saw on the cryptocurrency market only a day ago, most digital assets remain in the red. Bitcoin has lost 14% of its value during one week of trading, which, however, is not a number that experienced crypto traders are afraid of. The price performance of one of the most notable assets on the market against  Bitcoin  has been more than successful in the last few weeks and even months. The main reason behind it is the upcoming Vasil hard fork and the questionable future of Ethereum that switched off the PoW mechanism for good. From a technical standpoint, Cardano is also showing a prominent price performance, gaining over 8% to its value in the last seven days. At press time, it is breaking the upper border of the ascending triangle for the third time this month. The breakthrough is an important step toward the trend reversal on  ADA . The cryptocurrency lost over 60% of its value since the ATH and has not had a chance to recover, especially with the market conditions we have lived through in the last few months. Cardano also shows that it is not only rallying against Bitcoin but is also showing a better-than-average performance against the United States Dollar despite its strengthening against a bracket of foreign currencies. Another important factor is regular lack of clarity around  Ethereum , which became extremely similar to a security, which is why regulations may affect its investors and cause numerous problems for projects that are willing to start working on the network. If new regulatory policies are released for Ethereum, the asset's value may start tumbling rapidly, specifically because of the lack of network usage we are seeing now, considering the poor performance of the DeFi and NFT industries. Unless building on the network becomes popular again, both the profitability and revenue of Ethereum stays at an extremely low level, which is why the selling pressure on it increased exponentially in the last few days despite the Merge update. Despite the relief on the cryptocurrency market, Bitcoin is still in the process of moving through correction cycles after yet another rate hike initiated at the FOMC meeting on Sept. 21. Unfortunately, the uncontrollable inflation shows us that the regulator is still going to increase the key rate in the country despite the critical conditions on the stock market, which, as we know, dictates the movement of digital assets. At press time, Bitcoin is changing hands at $18,900 and still moving around this year's bottom.

Bill Barhydt, founder of crypto trading platform Abra, called the upgrade a “big win for developers” with  decentralized finance (DeFi)  platform Genius Yield,  tweeting  it was “one of the most complex and consequential updates to the Cardano network ever done.” Congrats to Cardano ($ADA) team on Vasil hardfork.  More hard work in crypto paying off. Making UTXO's and inputs accessible to scripts/Plutus without spending them is a big win for developers. Well done!   Congrats  @IOHK_Charles   @CardanoStiftung  and teams! — Bill Barhydt (@billbarhydt)  September 22, 2022 
 
 The date for the upgrade was  announced in early September  by IOHK, while the “critical mass indicators” needed to trigger the  hard fork were reached in the 24 hours  leading up to the event. Related:  Ethereum post-Merge hard forks are here: Now what?

The latest update on Hydra from Sept. 16  detailed  the team addressed a known issue with the Hydra nodes. The protocol has no set launch date, but it’s  intended  for some time in late 2022 or the first quarter of 2023.

cardano,No Section,Veteran Trader Peter Brandt Posts Ominous Chart Pattern for Cardano: Details,"Veteran trader  Peter Brandt  has posted an ominous chart pattern for the ADA price, which he tagged ""Without comment ADA."" Without comment  $ADA   $ADAUSD   pic.twitter.com/4VSB344lC1 Responding to the veteran trader's post, Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, says he is ""also super surprised."" ""Chart people once again forget to remember that there is apparently an entire world out there. It has central banks, nations, economies, supply chains. And all of those factors actually have an impact on markets. I'm also super surprised,"" he stated in response. The concerning chart pattern indicated by the veteran trader pertains to the ""descending triangle"" — a bearish formation that usually forms during a downtrend as a continuation pattern. A descending triangle appears as the price consolidates inside a range indicated by a falling upper trendline and a horizontal lower trendline. The upper trendline connects a series of lower highs and the second horizontal trendline also connects a series of lows. The triangle typically resolves after the price breaks below the lower trendline and, as a rule, it can fall as much as the height of the triangle. ADA is currently approaching the support of the lower trendline of its descending triangle setup as it trades at $0.46, up 1.82% in the last 24 hours. Since the start of September, Cardano has seen a slew of good news, from its listing on the stock brokerage app Robinhood to the successful launch of the Vasil upgrade on Sept. 22. The Vasil upgrade was triggered on the mainnet at 9:44:00 p.m. UTC on Sept. 22 to the joy of the Cardano community. The Vasil upgrade hopes to bring increased functionality, performance and scalability to Cardano. The upgrade arrives in the month of Cardano's fifth anniversary and, interestingly, in the birth month of Gerolamo Cardano, one of the most influential mathematicians of the Renaissance, whom the Cardano blockchain was named after. On Sept. 23, the IOG team successfully submitted the Plutus V2 cost model to the mainnet, which brings the full Vasil capability to developers after the next epoch, which is on Sept. 27. As reported by U.Today, Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, stated that the markets have entered into a bearish phase, when asked about the underperformance of ADA. The Cardano creator also claims that markets are disconnected from reality as Cardano has never been stronger than now.",https://u.today/veteran-trader-peter-brandt-posts-ominous-chart-pattern-for-cardano-details,utoday,2022-09-24,13:30:00,en
cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Criticizes Veteran Trader Peter Brandt,"The savvy trader faced strong  criticism  from the co-founder of  Cardano  when speaking about the problematic place ADA is in right now from a technical analysis. Hoskinson has also noted how important it is to consider the fundamental value of assets. The dispute began with a post that Peter Brandt shared on his personal Twitter blog. He did not break down the chart he posted, but it was clear that he sees nothing but problems for ADA, considering the prolonged downtrend and the descending triangle formation. Chart people once again forget to remember that there is apparently an entire world out there. It has like central banks, nations, economies, supply chains, and even wars. Amazing right? And all of those factors actually have an impact on markets. I'm also super surprised  https://t.co/jshu9SSGoF   pic.twitter.com/UohlUlgIjQ In addition to the descending triangle, Brandt left a depressing comment stating there is nothing to comment, which, most likely, became the beginning of the dispute. Charles Hoskinson retweeted the chart shared by Brandt and added that ""chart people"" forget that there is a whole ""world"" behind assets like Cardano. The performance of each financial asset is tied to central banks, nations, economies, supply chains and other major factors. The aforementioned things are the only things that have an impact on the market, Hoskinson believes. The statement was most likely devoted to technical analysts who quite often ignore fundamental factors when analyzing performance of certain assets. However, Brandt himself usually focuses on charting rather than  analyzing projects  themselves, which is why the reaction of Hoskinson seemed overextended to some users in the comment section below the post. The market performance of Cardano has indeed been problematic in the last few months, mostly following the general sentiment on the digital asset industry. A reversal was expected with the implementation of the  Vasil  update. However, no major volatility spikes were monitored in the last few days. It is fair to note that ADA is showing strength against Bitcoin with a 12% price increase in the last six days.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-criticizes-veteran-trader-peter-brandt,utoday,2022-09-24,14:17:00,en

Update on the Ethiopia Project https://t.co/Pe5X37s6Gu According to the article shared by the Cardano creator, the federal education authorities in Ethiopia have started implementing digital identity (ID) for students and teachers as part of the nationwide blockchain-based program. Data entry is scheduled to start next month, according to Zelalem Assefa, the Ministry's director of ICT and digital education. Nearly two dozen public schools have been selected to take part. Last year, Ethiopia's Minister of Education confirmed the partnership with IOG to provide five million students and 750,000 teachers working in 3,680 schools with digital ID cards. IOG later acknowledged that it was working on the code and established this year as the anticipated launch date for the project. The IDs, which would be launched at the primary and secondary school levels and then tertiary institutions, would come attached to a registry system that will be used to verify grades and monitor academic performance remotely. Officials hope to see half a million IDs issued by the end of this year. This initiative includes a national digital ID program that aims to provide digital IDs to 10 million citizens this year. So far, fewer than 100,000 IDs have been registered. Aside from the Ethiopian initiative, IOG also collaborated with World Mobile in Tanzania to connect the unconnected and enable access to essential online services through blockchain. According to John O'Connor, African Operations Director at IOG, these projects represent the jumping-off point for Cardano's mission to build RealFi: real finance targeted at the people who need new ways to access finance, creating that real value often missing from DeFi.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Vasil: Charles Hoskinson Speaks on One Other Thing That Might Benefit Blockchain,"The  Vasil upgrade  was successfully launched on the mainnet Sept. 22. Ahead of the much-anticipated upgrade, Artano, a Cardano-based NFT project, published its findings from extensive testing. When utilizing Plutus v2, an over 90% decrease in script size and a corresponding cost reduction of over 75% were reported. While cost reduction is overall beneficial in attracting new users to the blockchain, the concerns now pertain to the profitability of SPOs (stake pool operators). Per staking rewards  data,  Cardano ranks as the third largest blockchain with a staking market cap of $11.52 billion. Despite the enormous amount staked, Cardano's staking reward of 3.62% does not attract like others. Observers argue that the low rate of rewards would ensure that the blockchain does not experience inflation or hyperinflation. Sidechains solves this issue. SPOs will get multiple revenue streams by maintaining the sidechains and getting paid with those native tokens Responding to a user who expressed concerns over the profitability of SPOs amid low staking rewards and a huge slash in transaction fees following the Vasil upgrade, Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  remarked, ""Sidechains solve this issue. SPOs will get multiple revenue streams by maintaining the sidechains and getting paid with those native tokens."" Cardano is steadily expanding its community of developers and blockchain enthusiasts. According to recent IOG statistics, there are over 6.1 million native tokens and 1,107 projects overall building on Cardano to date. Adding a sidechain to Cardano makes it possible to create opportunities for developers using the Solidity language on Ethereum. For instance, using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), developers can easily build dApps on top of Cardano. Currently, sidechains running on Cardano include Milkomeda, Wanchain. Orbis is an additional scalability solution being developed within the Cardano ecosystem, which will act as a ZK (zero-knowledge) rollup Layer 2 protocol. IOG is planning to release a new permissionless EVM sidechain this year. The sidechain would allow developers to write Solidity smart contracts on Cardano and create EVM-compatible dApps and ERC20-compatible tokens (and, in time, their own sidechains).",https://u.today/cardano-vasil-charles-hoskinson-speaks-on-one-other-thing-that-might-benefit-blockchain,utoday,2022-09-25,13:46:00,en

Network sync is around 99%, which represents a high-performance network. This comes as part of the Vasil release is Diffusion pipelining, a further improvement to the consensus layer that allows for faster block propagation. Diffusion pipelining effectively speeds the process of sharing information about newly created blocks among network users by ensuring that blocks can be shared (propagated) on the network within five seconds (the safe security ""ceiling"") of being created. Diffusion pipelining propagates blocks before they are fully validated, ""overlapping"" the time spent on diffusion and the time required for validation. According to IOG, monitoring will continue for at least four epochs after the hard fork, after which a decision about future adjustments will be made based on ""regular"" network bandwidth. Full Vasil functionality, including support for reference inputs, inline datums, reference scripts, collateral outputs and a new Plutus cost model, will be available to developers on the mainnet on Sept. 27.

On Sunday, Web3 investor Evan Van Ness shared an unpopular opinion, claiming that the Ethereum Merge could have been shipped earlier. Ness said: ""Unpopular* opinion: The Merge should have shipped sooner. The last 10 days are evidence that we should have shipped sooner."" Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin shared some issues as to why it hadn't moved sooner with Hoskinson joining in the conversation, claiming Ethereum developers should have implemented the Snow White protocol to ensure a faster migration to PoS.  You should have just implemented snow white with Elaine's help. It would have saved you a heck of a lot of pain and effort. — Charles Hoskinson (@IOHK_Charles)  September 25, 2022 
 
 Snow White, a protocol  Hoskinson has advocated for years , is one of the first protocols to provide end-to-end, formal proofs of security for a PoS system. But Hoskinson’s response opened a can of worms, which later led to a heated debate between the Cardano founder and Van Ness, along with other Ethereum developers Hoskinson claimed that his ideas regarding the technical upgrades on the Ethereum network from 2014 still hold better than what the Ethereum network has upgraded to post Merge. Van Ness quickly  reminded  Hoskinson that he was fired from Ethereum within six months because of his poor behavior and lack of any significant technical contribution. Related:  Cardano Vasil upgrade ready with all ‘critical mass indicators’ achieved Earlier on Monday, Hoskinson, in a Twitter thread, accused Ethereum developers of ignoring Ouroboros  — a secure PoS blockchain and the first protocol to be based on peer-reviewed research — throughout the last five years. He also claimed that the current version of its PoS upgrade with custodial staking is a bad design. Ethereum core developer Hudson Jameson called out Hoskinson’s claims regarding the Ouroboros protocol implementation. He even said that Ethereum devs disliked Cardano primarily because of his “attitude and actions as the face of Cardano.”  I guess Charles forgot about his Reddit history and how much he shit on Ethereum as he was building Cardano.

cardano, Analysis , What Cardano’s Vasil hard fork means for the blockchain ,"After several delays and some setbacks, Cardano’s long-awaited Vasil upgrade finally went  live  on Sept. 22. From the outside looking in, the hard fork is designed to help improve the ecosystem’s scalability and general transaction throughput capacity as well as advance Cardano’s  decentralized applications (DApps)  development capacity.  To  commemorate  the event, an announcement was made by blockchain firm Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) — which currently oversees the design, building and maintenance of the Cardano platform — just minutes after the development. To obtain a more holistic overview of what the upgrade represents and its potential impact on Cardano (as well as the crypto ecosystem at large), Cointelegraph reached out to Shahaf Bar-Geffen, CEO of COTI, a protocol for creating decentralized payment networks and stablecoins. In his view: “The Vasil Upgrade heralds the dawn of a new era for the Cardano ecosystem and the decentralized finance space at large. The upgrade aims to improve the network’s scalability and enhance Cardano’s smart contract capabilities.” Bar-Geffen further noted that the hard fork will significantly improve the efficiency of Djed, an algorithmic stablecoin developed jointly by IOHK and the COTI Group, increasing the number of transactions carried out on the Djed platform and thus helping position Cardano as a prime contender for stablecoin transactions. A closer look at what Vasil has to offer Before looking at the functional and operational benefits afforded by the Vasil hard fork, it would be best to understand what exactly a hard fork is. In its most basic sense, a hard fork is a network upgrade set in motion when those governing a blockchain platform decide to add or fix certain features to the ecosystem.  In other words, when a hard fork takes place, the network splits into two versions that run separately, where one version follows existing features and rules while the other continues as an upgraded version of the network.  Expounding her view on the technical aspects of the upgrade, Charmyn Ho, head of crypto insights for cryptocurrency exchange Bybit, told Cointelegraph that at the application layer, Cardano’s Vasil hard fork aims to bolster the network’s current smart contracts to curate a better experience for both users and developers alike, adding: “This will simultaneously lead to a more efficient building process with regard to applications on the chain. At the infrastructure level, the many upgrades that come with the Vasil hard fork will allow Cardano to increase its block size and TPS whilst maintaining its POS mechanism.” Ho further highlighted that the Vasil hard fork is aimed not just at improving the scalability of the chain and optimizing its existing features but also at bolstering the network’s stability and connectivity. “This is a huge and prominent step forward for Cardano as the upgrade is expected to reduce the network’s transaction costs while increasing transaction speeds,” she added.  Recent:  Ethereum post-Merge hard forks are here — Now what? Lastly, it is worth noting that Vasil is not Cardano’s first major network upgrade because a year or so ago, the project witnessed the launch of another hard fork called Alonzo, which was designed to allow users to devise DApps using smart contracts. The Alonzo upgrade, alongside many other developments, was Cardano’s way of providing users with an attractive alternative to Ethereum, another platform that allows for the seamless development of novel applications using smart contracts. Why is Vasil so important? Named after a prominent member of the Cardano community who passed away in 2021, Vasil St. Dabov, the upgrade will enhance the ecosystem’s transaction throughput, efficiency and block latency speeds. Furthermore, the hard fork will see the implementation of a technique called diffusion pipelining, which seeks to improve block propagation times while increasing the network’s transaction processing capabilities. The Vasil hard fork will introduce three key Cardano Improvement Proposals (CIPs), namely CIP-31, CIP-32 and CIP-33. In this regard, CIP-31 will spur the introduction of a new reference input mechanism that will allow DApps to access transactional output data without having to recreate it as before, making the entire process extremely streamlined and time-saving. At the same time, CIP-32 is designed to enhance Cardano’s native decentralization levels by introducing an on-chain data storage feature for network participants. CIP-33 will make transactions lighter by making changes to the system’s native programming script, allowing for faster processing as well as reduced fees. Lastly, another improvement called CIP-40 will be introduced as part of Vasil. It will introduce a new output transaction mechanism to help improve block transmission without full validation.  Other updates include an enhancement of Cardano’s native smart contract programming language Plutus, which will now be more functionally advanced than its previous iteration. Not only that, Vasil will also improve the platform’s security by making it easier to interface with Cardano’s UTXO model (which has been built to resemble that of Bitcoin) while keeping its transaction load off-chain. Potential effects on ADA While the first round of the hard fork started on Sept. 22, the remaining upgrades are set to take effect on Sept 27. To this point, the second phase of the hard fork will look to redefine Plutus’ cost model, which has a direct effect on the processing power and memory fees required to govern Cardano’s native smart contracts. In addition to the Vasil upgrade, the Cardano team revealed that it has been working tirelessly on the development of its layer-2 scaling solution — the Hydra head protocol — which is capable of processing transactions from the Cardano blockchain while still making use of it as its core security and settlement layer.  To this point, a recent update by the Cardano team revealed it had successfully addressed a known issue with Hydra’s node framework. As things stand, the protocol does not have a fixed release date. However, the IOHK team has hinted that the offering could make its way into the market sometime in late 2022 or the first quarter of 2023. Recent:  El Salvador's Bitcoin decision: Tracking adoption a year later Vasil was originally slated to go live earlier this year but faced numerous setbacks. Even though the upgrade is live now, the ecosystem continues to reel in from the impact of these delays. For example, since the start of 2020, Cardano’s native cryptocurrency,  ADA , has continued to witness a  dip  in its transaction volume. Not only that, but from a purely price-performance standpoint, the upgrade has not been able to do much in terms of spurring ADA’s value, with the currency trading down less than 1% on the week. Despite ADA’s price action continuing to remain quite lackluster, the fact that the Cardano ecosystem has made such tremendous strides over the past year shows that the project seems to be primed for big things in the near to mid-term.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/what-cardano-s-vasil-hard-fork-means-for-the-blockchain,cointelegraph,2022-09-26,00:00:00,en

Comparing Cardano's month-on-month and year-on-year figures, it turns out to be positive here as well. For example, inflows increased by $700,000 in a month and by $14.4 million in a year. In addition to Cardano,  XRP  saw small positive flows. Larger infusions of funds were seen in Bitcoin- and Ethereum-focused crypto products. After two weeks of large outflows amid a network merger, Ethereum-oriented funds raised almost $7 million. As for  Bitcoin , for the first time in weeks, inflows into the main cryptocurrency came amid outflows from Short Bitcoin funds betting on its fall. While the past week as a whole marked the second consecutive week of positive funds flows into crypto products at $8.3 million, one cannot ignore the extremely large month-on-month outflows, which amounted to almost $53 million. However, the year-on-year situation is clearly better, and if CoinShares data is to be believed,  cryptocurrency  exchange-traded funds have inflows of $436 million.

According to Binance’s official announcement, it has decided to burn all trading commissions collected by the exchange on  LUNC  spot and margin pairs against BUSD and USDT. This surprising move comes after the exchange abandoned its initial plans to introduce a burn-in subscription and the implementation of a full burn-in tax when a certain number of subscribers are reached. Binance CEO CZ explained the rejection, adding that the introduction of a subscription would have been a technically challenging solution and was also met poorly by the LUNC community. LUNC has immediately surged on the news, adding 25% to its value. Shiba Inu Games' lead consultant William Volk has recently shared  Shiba Eternity’s  reviews on his Twitter page; according to a screenshot, the game has been rated 4.9 out of 5. However, some users started questioning the level of Shiba Eternity’s engagement and its number of downloads, as after being tested in three countries (Vietnam, Australia and, allegedly, Indonesia) the game has only 123 reviews. While the details of the level of engagement of the game in the last two countries of testing remain rather scanty, the SHIB CCG game was a hit in Vietnam, as reported by  U.Today . According to Volk, the team had to increase the capacity of gameplay servers fifty-fold due to higher-than-expected demand. After more than two weeks of silence, Terra co-founder  Do Kwon  has reappeared on Twitter to announce that he is not hiding from authorities and is now writing code in his living room. Kwon’s post gained traction among the crypto community, with many Twitter users asking what the controversial crypto developer thinks of Interpol’s red notice. Previously, South Korean prosecutors confirmed that Interpol issued a red notice for Kwon, meaning that he could be arrested and then returned to South Korea. Kwon replied that he is not on the list of publicly available red notices for wanted persons, downplaying the Interpol request. However, the majority of red notices are private and can be viewed only by law enforcement agencies. At the moment, Kwon’s whereabouts are still unknown. Three days after the  Vasil hard fork  was deployed at the protocol level, Rick McCracken, who runs the DIGI stake pool on Cardano, shared his observations about the network. Per his tweet, block propagation times remain consistently near 300 milliseconds, which is a drastic drop from the pre-hard fork 1,600 milliseconds. However, the performance of the network is high, with network sync being around 99%. This comes as part of the Vasil release is diffusion pipelining, a further improvement to the consensus layer that allows for faster block propagation.

The problem statement of the proposal reads: ""Daedalus, the decentralized Cardano wallet, is painfully slow, taking a whole day to sync initially and hours to resync when used only occasionally—an unfavorable impression of Cardano for new users."" However, some Cardano users feel that the solutions proposed in Daedalus Turbo might not have as much impact. According to  Rick McCraken , who runs the DIGI stake pool on Cardano, a proper gap analysis would have likely determined that Cardano does not need a ""Daedalus Turbo."" According to reports, the total funds allocated to Daedalus Turbo is $759,000, which is nearly 6% of the total catalyst budget. Sooraj , an analyst at ZK roll-up solution Orbis, believes that ""the proposal Daedalus Turbo is infeasible in the current state, which got funded.""

Mithril is a stake-based signature scheme that aims to improve the speed and efficiency of syncing times for nodes joining the network. It is a solution targeted toward network performance that aims to streamline the speed and efficiency of data synchronization between applications. Daedalus is a full-node wallet that downloads a full copy of the Cardano blockchain and independently validates every transaction in its history.

Once the test run is completed, the changes will be deployed to the public testnet. According to the COTI network, one major thing left is the final audit results, which will see if any critical issues are discovered. If there are no issues, it says it will go ahead and deploy Djed on the mainnet. However, no specific date has been communicated yet on the mainnet deployment. The Djed stablecoin continues to see new developments, among which are extensive script optimizations to help increase throughput, which has also assisted in slashing more than 60% of the execution budget (fees). Also, the ADA exchange rate acquisition module was updated to consider at least six external sources, for redundancy and security reasons. COTI also says that Djed capabilities have been improved to test and deploy new versions. It says 80% of the test objectives have been implemented to automatically test the Djed smart contracts and Plutus backend applications (PAB). Cardano says it is taking its time on the Djed stablecoin owing to the catastrophic Terra collapse in May. The Terra ecosystem crumbled after Terra UST Stablecoin lost parity with the dollar, thus depegging.",https://u.today/cardanos-djed-stablecoin-closer-than-ever-to-deployment-heres-one-thing-left,utoday,2022-09-30,11:44:00,en
cardano,No Section,"David Gokhshtein's Still Got Bags of DOGE, Cardano Creator Urges IOTA’s Co-founder to Debate, SHIB to Be Burned via Amazon in New Way: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","The last days of September were rich with crypto events. Take a look at the most important of them with U.Today’s top four news stories. David Gokhshtein , crypto enthusiast and founder of Gokhshtein Media, has long been supporting Dogecoin, calling it a crypto that can allow people  to get into Bitcoin . Yesterday, he expressed his liking for the main meme coin by saying that he still holds a lot of DOGE and is now waiting for its price to go parabolic. In one of his recent tweets, apparently trying to settle a dispute between the communities of Shiba Inu and Dogecoin, he said that it is okay to hold both Dogecoin and Shiba Inu. According to data by CoinMarketCap, DOGE is currently ranked 10th in the top 10 cryptos list and is changing hands at $0.05998. Reddit users following updates of both Cardano and IOTA have recently requested  Charles Hoskinson  and Dominik Schiener to debate, suggesting such topics as the status quo, achievements, milestones and technology. In response to the request, Hoskinson asked the IOTA co-founder if he would agree to have a discussion, to which Schiener replied in the affirmative. The latter seemed to be excited by the idea of debating, saying that it would allow him to talk about the progress and roadmap of IOTA's new protocol. Schiener also suggested inviting the IOTA Foundation's Hans Moog, a tech enthusiast, hacker and entrepreneur with 24 years of experience in software development, to take part in the debate. As per Shibburn’s recent tweet, SHIB tokens can now be burned via Amazon's Alexa app by listening to  Shibburn Radio  on devices connected to it. Amazon has confirmed that station ingestion has been completed, and the radio station that helps burn Shiba Inu tokens is now live. The radio will also have its own website, app and live DJs. The app for the radio that will run on iOS devices is expected to go live within the next two days. Later on, Shibburn Radio will be included for CarPlay and Android Radio. As stated in a tweet, the creation of such radio is an effort to “get sponsors to burn more and expose SHIB to more people.” Yesterday,  LUNC  trading volume dropped 34.43% and the asset’s price lost 1% of its value. Since Monday, Sept. 26, when Binance announced the token burning mechanism, volumes have fallen by 75%. While on the day of announcement LUNC's trading volume exceeded $2 billion, now it does not exceed $600 million. It is worth noting that Binance accounts for only $306 billion in LUNC, which is a little more than half of all of the trading volumes of the cryptocurrency. The first stage of burning will end on Oct. 1, and the number of LUNC burned over this first period will only be known by the community on Oct. 3.",https://u.today/david-gokhshteins-still-got-bags-of-doge-cardano-creator-urges-iotas-co-founder-to-debate-shib-to,utoday,2022-09-30,15:40:00,en

The Ethereum maxi also brought up the valuation of the two networks. According to the provided data, Uniswap is valued at $6 billion, while Cardano's valuation sits at $20 billion. However, the valuation does not help ADA to generate even half of the fees Uniswap does. Let's check in on the  $ADA  zombiechain 🧟⛓️ 
 
Not only does Cardano do less than one transaction per second... 
 
Uniswap does substantially more transactions than Cardano  pic.twitter.com/wg0fNoFPck It is important to note that the network's revenue is mostly formed by transaction and interaction fees. Cardano usually aims at bringing a cheaper and more scalable experience to users, while Ethereum-based projects may sometimes offer extremely expensive transactions when the blockchain is under a heavy load. Some users also noted that it is inaccurate to compare Uniswap and  Cardano  as they both use different models: account-based and eUTXO. The eUTXO model is more robust compared to the account-based model that requires a state machine that will determine the state of an account at any given time. However, the main downside of the eUTXO model is its inability to fit multiple transactions in one block, which is a crucial feature for decentralized applications and services. Van Ness also added that the cheapness of the network is possible only because of its ""centralized"" nature and empty blocks. However, it is hard to objectively say that Cardano is more centralized than Ethereum. Previously, we mentioned how only one entity that claims to be decentralized actually has some dangerous centralization signs while controlling more than 30% of the whole network.",https://u.today/ethereum-maxi-calls-ada-zombiechain-heres-why,utoday,2022-09-30,08:02:00,en

Founder of Cardano, IOG and co-founder of Ethereum,  Charles Hoskinson, could not help  taking a jab at a Cardano competitor whose founders previously poured criticism on Cardano chain. This is not the first time, SOL founders and Hoskinson have been ""exchanging courtesies"" about their rival's chains. https://t.co/HTtMMPFvdY   pic.twitter.com/oIthAEjg0i An hour, ago Solana network was successfully restarted. This was yet another outage in a series of temporary failures of the ecosystem that took place throughout 2022. The glitch that took Solana network down took several ours to diagnose and fix. Within less than a year, this has been by far not the first outage of Solana. According to another tweet of @SolanaStatus, Solana restarted its Mainnet Beta. Now, all operators of the network will carry on restoring client services, which will take them several hours. Validator operators successfully completed a cluster restart of Mainnet Beta at 7 AM UTC. 
 
Network operators an dapps will continue to restore client services over the next several hours. The previous time when Solana faced a more than four-hour outage was in June. In January, the network was down for more than 18 hours, and it brought massive losses to traders who were unable to sell their SOL tokens, and just watched the price plunge, losing large amounts of money. At the time of writing this, SOL is down 6.35 percent on the news, trading at $33.09, almost completely erasing its gains of more than 9 percent it saw over the past few days.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-takes-jab-at-solana-as-network-experiences-new-outage,utoday,2022-10-01,09:59:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Reaches New Scaling Milestone That Might Allow Nodes To Sync Faster: Details,"Cardano  is about setting a milestone in scaling solution Mithril, as IOG CTO,  Romain Pellerin , tweeted about bootstrapping a Cardano node through a Mithril snapshot within minutes. Mithril was listed as one of the ways Cardano intended to scale at the start of the year. Cardano builder IOG introduced Mithril during the 2021 Cardano Summit. Since then, the team has made steady development progress. Just bootstrapped a  #Cardano  node on Preview testnet on a new OSX machine through a Mithril snapshot in JUST a few minutes 🖖 
 
Love it 💓  pic.twitter.com/86y2lsheoV The IOG team recently stated it has been working on a first use case to leverage Mithril to quickly and efficiently bootstrap a full Cardano node. The Cardano network connects thousands of nodes into one unified system, where they communicate with other nodes to provide information about new blocks and transactions. Because every node has a complete copy of the blockchain, synchronizing nodes requires each new node to download and verify each block, which adds time to the process. Mithril aims to use the current network to give certified snapshots of all or a portion of the blockchain state, thereby significantly cutting down on node synchronization time. As stated in a recent  blog post , the team is in the final stages of Mithril network optimization and testing in its first centralized version. Additional use cases will be introduced, such as integrating Mithril into wallets and light clients. Now that Mithril is open source, the team has kept working on the certification of the SPOs registering in the Mithril network and on the new version of the release procedure, as was mentioned in the most recent  IOG weekly update . The current Mithril test environment is being run at the moment with pioneer SPOs. The same idea of stake that underpins the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is the foundation of Mithril. Stakeholders in Ouroboros are chosen to produce blocks at random with a chance corresponding to the amount of stake they own or delegate. Mithril allows participants to sign the current ledger state using a lottery system where the likelihood of their contribution is also proportional to their stake.",https://u.today/cardano-reaches-new-scaling-milestone-that-might-allow-nodes-to-sync-faster-details,utoday,2022-10-01,15:37:00,en

The co-founder of Cardano is fascinated by the fact that the people who tweet such thoughts actually believe them despite the evidence. A quite common anti-Cardano narrative in the industry is the belief that the Cardano developers never deliver what they promise in the first case. It mostly formed after some Cardano-related projects ended up being different from what had been promised to users. What is extraordinary to me is that the people who tweet this stuff actually believe it regardless of the evidence given. It's basically like religious beliefs.

The most notable representative of the Cardano DeFi industry was SundaeSwap, which had many issues at the start and even some congestion cases. Most of Cardano's problems come from the eUTXO model, which does not imply fitting more than one transaction in the block. That is why the Cardano developers had to come up with alternative solutions that would make DeFi on  ADA  possible. The developer cannot see any sanity in statements similar to what he has shown in the tweet. Hoskinson stated that every year the Cardano developers are moving mountains together, while representatives of other networks cannot see any of it for reasons unknown. Despite some success in development, the market performance of Cardano is far from ideal as the cryptocurrency has been moving in a prolonged downturn for the last 400 days.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Drops Heavily Against BTC, Here's What Comes Next","The price performance of  Cardano  against Bitcoin was showing far more potential than against USD as the cryptocurrency had numerous chances to break through the upper border of a common chart pattern and enter full  reversal  mode. The main reason behind the drop below the chart pattern was the short-term Bitcoin rally against the U.S. dollar and the stalemate on Cardano we saw in the last few weeks. While the first cryptocurrency was showing strength, ADA has been slowly descending against USD, losing around 7% of its value in the last few days. Bitcoin, on the other hand, gained over 2% to its price in the same period of time, which explains the poor performance of ADA against BTC that we are seeing now. The drop below the pattern's support level is an unfortunate event for the altcoin, but it is not changing anything on the USD pair, which is considered the main trading pair given its trading volume. However, the invalidation of the set-up on the Bitcoin chart makes  ADA's  downtrend reversal less possible and brings more risks for Cardano investors to the table, considering the lack of momentum on the asset. The next major support level for ADA against Bitcoin is at approximately 0.00002 BTC as the asset bounced off of it at least two times, and the third time might be successful too. As for the USD pair, Cardano is continuously moving in the consolidation channel formed back in August.

He believes that leaving miners on just to produce an additional two million coins over the course of the next 100 years is not a good investment of energy. Even though Bitcoin is promoted as the counterbalance to central banks, the vast majority of Bitcoin in circulation is actually held by custodial accounts, Hoskinson notes. ""That a fact.

cardano,No Section,"Here's What Cardano's ""Superpower"" Is, Developer Explains","Cardano developer Peter Oravec has  shared  a visual representation of how transactions on the network really work and explained why it will attract more people to Cardano from networks like  Ethereum . It is common knowledge that Cardano utilizes a completely different mechanism for handling transactions on the network. For example, Ethereum uses an account-based model that requires having a separate entity that would check the state of each account and its balances. Undeniably, the model used by networks like Ethereum has numerous advantages, like high TPS and convenience. There are two  #Cardano  transactions on this picture... #eutxo   #cardano   pic.twitter.com/84P1WZ5nZh Cardano, on the other hand, uses a completely different mechanism called eUTxO. The main difference between the account-based model and UTXO is the way the network handles transactions. In UTXO-based blockchains, all transactions occur in parallel to each other. It brings a wide array of benefits such as determinism, lower transaction fees and less from running, but it makes the usage of decentralized applications on such networks more complicated. However, despite all the problems  Cardano  has, the developer believes that more users will start utilizing Cardano's model thanks to the network's ability to fit numerous outputs in one transaction. Thanks to the visualized blockchain developed by Oravec, we can see how Cardano fits 923 outputs in only two transactions. Each output is later sent to a recipient which, from a user's standpoint, does not differ from a regular cryptocurrency transfer. According to Oravec, this is the superpower of UTxO since it allows making extremely cheap transactions without worrying about the stability of the network and congestion issues that Ethereum faces all the time. However, it is safe to say that Cardano has a long way to go in terms of network revenue and activity compared to Ethereum.",https://u.today/heres-what-cardanos-superpower-is-developer-explains,utoday,2022-10-05,11:18:00,en

Because of the recent upgrade, it has become the first Cardano-backed DEX that can simultaneously function as an automated market makers (AMMs) and support order books. It is worth noting that the old order orderbook is compatible with the newly released one.   MuesliSwap became the first DEX to launch on Cardano back in November 2021. This happened shortly after the launch of the Alonzo hard fork, which added smart contracts to the popular proof-of-work blockchain. The exchange was initially based on the simple orderbook model, but the exchange has now added liquidity pools. MuesliSwap’s AMM protocol is now capable of filling orders automatically by directly interacting with the orderbook.    The new feature also allows more complex protocols to interact with  DeFi  protocols.

A further drop below $0.25 from the current price of $0.43 might mean a nearly 50% drop. The  $ADAUSD  chart is a classic descending triangle per Schabacker, Edwards and Magee and suggests a possible decline to sub .25. Do charts always work? -- not really, but when they do it is a thing of beauty. Note -- I do NOT short  #8hitcoins   pic.twitter.com/HP6mEbChJq Peter Brandt further added that he is only involved in (trading) Bitcoin and ETH against the USD ""in the factor prop account."" Hence, he does not short ADA. The ""descending triangle"" chart pattern indicated by Brandt refers to a bearish signal that usually forms during a downtrend as a continuation pattern. As reported by  U.Today , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson reacted to the bearish chart previously posted by Brandt, saying, ""Chart people once again forget to remember that there is apparently an entire world out there. It has central banks, nations, economies, supply chains. And all of those factors actually have an impact on markets. I'm also super surprised."" While Peter Brandt is sticking to his bearish prediction on ADA, he, however, concedes that at times the charts may not work but, ""when they do, it's a thing of beauty."" Also, given the current macroeconomic environment, all models, technical indicators and historical precedents may be put to the test when it comes to predicting the market's next move. A Twitter user, in response to the veteran trader, recalled his prediction in 2021, in which Brandt predicted that ADA would dip to $0.10. But instead, it went ahead to set all-time highs of nearly $3. However, how the current prediction by the veteran trader will play out is yet unknown. 😠  #Cardano ,  #EOS , and  #Tron  are 3 once popular assets that have had trading crowds begin to turn on them.

This month we see a great boost of upward movements across key metrics including a nice uplift in the use of  #SmartContracts .💥 
 
 #Blockchain   #BuildingOnCardano   pic.twitter.com/62blWJjtDu Turning to more details, the number of transactions reached 51.2 million, up 4.2% from August. At the same time, the overall number of wallets grew by 1.34%, while the number of wallets delegating  ADA  to staking increased by 3.4%. Thus, at the moment, out of 3.6 million ADA wallets, 1.22 million are involved in staking and, therefore, the work of the network. In addition to this data, Input Output previously  provided  statistics affecting the number of projects being built on  Cardano . According to it, blockchain is now home to 1,113 projects, of which 100 joined in September. Cardano has more than 6.1 million tokens, 3,307 scripts on the Plutus smart contract platform and 62,162 token policies. No sooner had the crypto world become familiar with Vasil hard fork, which occurred in the final weeks of September, than  Charles Hoskinson  started talking about a new era in the life of blockchain, the Voltaire era. According to Cardano's founder, the implementation of the following innovations will teach everyone a lesson in proper decentralized governance.

Thus, on the background of strong optimism,  ADA  quotes grew by almost 20% in the first two weeks of August. After that, along with the price correction, there was a change in sentiment and so on. What is more interesting is that during the long-awaited launch of Vasil hard fork,  Cardano  did not feature any special mood or price movements. Despite this important event in the life of blockchain, the market has either not yet appreciated the innovation, or the ""power reserve"" was exhausted by the time of its launch. Paying attention to the global picture of ADA, it can be said that there was not much drama with pessimistic sentiment. The token continues to trade in the wide price corridor of $0.4-$0.5, but it is still in its lower part, at the level of $0.43.

The problem is that the reported account was impersonating  Vitalik Buterin  and promoting crypto scams. The co-founder of Cardano and IOHK added to his post that he cannot wait for Elon Musk to take over the social media platform and ""terminate"" whoever is responsible for the ""pathetic"" bot control. He also stated that he hopes that the person will never work in technology again.

Quit and never work in technology again  pic.twitter.com/fioOepASqC The rich reaction of the developer is understandable since the number of bots or fake accounts under the posts of  influencers  sometimes corresponds to more than 90% of the total number of reactions or comments to a story. Elon Musk has previously stated that almost every comment he sees is made by a bot, fake page or someone who impersonates popular cryptocurrency or financial influencers. Reportedly, the high percentage of bots on the platform was the main reason why Musk decided to terminate the Twitter takeover deal a few months ago. Recently, Musk changed his mind and decided to give the Twitter deal a green light, agreeing to purchase shares for $54.20. The total volume of it will be at $42 billion.

cardano, News , 670K follower ETH Classic account turns into Ergo: What happened? ,"Followers of the Ethereum Classic Twitter account may have found themselves the unintended fans of an entirely new crypto project after Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson turned the account into the new community page for the Ergo community. The Ethereum Classic account had built up over 600,000 followers since its inception in July 2016, and up until Sept. 15, it has been used to post about Ethereum Classic. As of Oct. 6, however, the Twitter page now reflects the Ergo Platform, a  proof-of-work (PoW)  blockchain capable of facilitating smart contracts, similar to Ethereum, with  links to Cardano . In a lengthy thread pinned on Ethereum Classic’s new Twitter handle on Oct. 6, Bob Summerwill, the executive director of a public charity supporting Ethereum Classic, pointed the finger at Hoskinson for repurposing the account, noting that “6 years of community work has been erased.”  The new handle is yet to reach the follower numbers of its old account, with only 364 followers at the time of writing.  So what just happened with this account?  — Ethereum Classic (@eth_classic)  October 6, 2022 
 
 In the thread, Summerwill outlines how Hoskinson’s blockchain company Input Output Hong Kong (IOHK) withdrew from the ETC for a second time following a lack of support for a  proposal  of his and refused to talk about the Twitter account until a Sep. 6 Twitter post where he declared he would not be returning it to the ETC community. Return? It's my account.

He boasted that 16,164 ADA tokens were distributed to 217 holders in a single transaction. The fee for it was as little as 0.78173 ADA. He used this example to slam Cardano haters who claim that the platform cannot scale this model. According to the Reddit post, whose screenshot Hoskinson shared on his Twitter page, the transaction was made by a Cardano-based NFT project called Space Pugs Alpha. The author on Reddit stated that transactions like this take place on the Cardano chain every day via its extended UTXO (eUTXO) model.

Tell me again how EUTXO can't scale and we only do 1 tps.  pic.twitter.com/glCtBJwUoQ UTXO is a model used by both the Bitcoin and Ethereum chains. Cardano went further and created the extended UTXO model. It supports a much more expressive form of validation scripts, which includes scripts that enforce invariants across entire transaction chains. The common  anti-Cardano narrative  that is circulating around the crypto industry at the moment is that the eUTXO model is unable to fit more than one transaction into the block. In a tweet published a week ago, Hoskinson stated that Cardano ""moves mountains every year,"" but its opponents keep repeating on Twitter that this network's developers do not deliver. Hoskinson keeps responding to these accusations from time to time, but the haters do not seem to go away. Even though ADA remains in the top 10 list by market capitalization value, its recent performance has not been too encouraging. Last time the market saw ADA soaring was last year in August, when Bitcoin was at much higher price levels.

""In the future, if I have something and he has something, maybe we collaborate on it,"" he added. However, he does not see them working on a joint crypto project. At the same time, Hoskinson shared some criticism of the Ethereum Foundation, which he claims continues to ignore Cardano's technology because of personal animosity toward him. The Ethereum foundation also made it very clear that they don’t look at any of our technology because I’m the worst person in the world. Apparently, that’s their criteria for the technology. They have to like you to look at your stuff. Last month, Hoskinson tweeted that  it was a ""crime""  for the Ethereum community to even discuss his project. Hoskinson, who parted ways with other Ethereum co-founders during the project's early stages of development,  joked  that it was not too late for Buterin to switch to Cardano earlier this year.

The public launch is coming in the next few weeks. The main difference between peer-2-peer lending and borrowing and peer-2-pool is the absence of a human factor.

One can also note an increase in the number of transactions, which was generally the case before the Vasil hard fork. However, a particular move in the number of  Cardano  transactions being processed was made Sept. 25, and so far this momentum has continued.

if you want to examine which dApps have generated load - find out at  @dappsoncardano   https://t.co/xv5UEjvZ7y The release of SundaeSwap, Minswap and various NFT marketplaces provided the most network load, according to Dapps on Cardano. Contrary to the popular belief, the blockchain can handle more than one transaction per second. However, it is done differently compared to a network like Ethereum. Because it uses the eUTxO accounting model, ADA has to ""fit"" numerous entities in one block and then redistribute funds among them, making numerous transactions per block de facto possible. Due to the aforementioned mechanism, some  blockchain  explorers and network trackers cannot see the true number of transactions and show values way below the actual number of transactions made in a certain period. However, the network still has a long way to go to catch up with blockchains like  Ethereum  or Solana that successfully process thousands of transactions per second, especially during the rise of the DeFi and NFT industries.

Blockchain and non-fungible tokens could be the solution for the entire problem. Decentralized solutions are utilizing biometric identity terminals around the world that help create a digital identity verified by a third-party state-trusted verifier. All important data is contained on blockchains like  Cardano , which makes the data storage process safer and more decentralized. Some decentralization and blockchain enthusiasts disagreed with Raoul Pal as he suggested using the services of companies like Google and Meta in order to solve the aforementioned problem.

Solana is one of the few whose monthly revenue from commissions barely fell. This past September, the Silicon Valley blockchain earned $1.5 million, just 6.9% behind August's results. Among all the blockchains featured in the CryptoRank infographic, Solana is second only to Ethereum and BNB Chain in terms of transaction earnings. The drop in earnings of blockchain and smart contract platforms is not surprising, given the overall decline in both crypto market inflows and the strain on platforms. What is more unsurprising is that blockchains like  Cardano  or Polygon, which offer relatively cheaper transactions, collect even fewer fees during a crypto winter.",https://u.today/heres-how-much-cardano-has-earned-from-transactions-and-how-it-differs-from-ethereum-and-solana,utoday,2022-10-10,08:10:00,en
cardano,No Section,"“Rich Dad, Poor Dad” Author Says It’s Time for BTC, SHIB Finally Listed on BitMex, This Could Reduce Ripple’s Chance to Win SEC: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today has prepared the top four news stories over the past day. ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad"" author  Robert Kiyosaki  has yet again predicted a massive crash of the U.S. dollar and economy in a recent tweet, saying that millions could be “wiped out.” Kiyosaki wrote that people only take into consideration microeconomic things, such as prices of food and fuel going up, but macroeconomic issues remain invisible to them. The bestselling author then urged his followers to protect themselves “from macro,” recommending to buy not only Bitcoin this time, but also silver and gold. Kiyosaki has been predicting the forthcoming collapse of the USD over the past two years and has good reasons for this. In 2020 alone, the Fed printed more than 6 trillion dollars, and the U.S. central bank has increased interest rates several times this year. BitMex , one of the best-known cryptocurrency exchanges, has made an official announcement about the upcoming listing of six new cryptocurrencies. Among these soon-to-be-listed coins is the well-known meme token, Shiba Inu. The listing will allow users to convert, deposit and withdraw SHIB to their exchange accounts. BitMex remained one of the few major crypto exchanges that had not yet introduced a Dogecoin competitor. However, the news of the listing did not seem to impact SHIB’s price, as the meme canine coin is changing hands at $0.00001034, down 5.04% over the past 24 hours. Charles Hoskinson , founder of Cardano and IOG, wrote on his official Twitter account that not only did corruption allegations against the SEC not help the case, but they also harm Ripple, reducing the company’s chance of winning against the regulator. The IOG head also replied to attorney John Deaton that discussions about corruption will have no impact on the court’s decision regarding XRP’s regulatory status. As U.Today reported before, Hoskinson recently stirred up the XRP community by describing their corruption allegations against former top SEC official Willian Hinman as “a grand conspiracy theory.” This led some XRP supporters to start tweeting about “digging dirt” on Hoskinson, accusing him of being in cahoots with the Ethereum Foundation. According to data shared by @shibaplay_ Twitter user, an  anonymous whale  has transferred an astounding 160 billion Shiba Inu worth $1.7 million. Per an Etherscan report, over the past 20 days, the same investor has sold roughly 623 billion meme coins, while buying a whopping trillion SHIB prior to that. This trillion-token purchase was made on the Crypto.com exchange. After that, he or she divided this amount of coins and started moving it in chunks that carried mostly 150-160 billion SHIB. Thirty-eight days ago, this whale bought one trillion SHIB and then sold them in the same manner. Meanwhile, Shiba Inu surpassed the LOCUS token as the biggest holding of the top Ethereum whales.",https://u.today/rich-dad-poor-dad-author-says-its-time-for-btc-shib-finally-listed-on-bitmex-this-could-reduce,utoday,2022-10-11,14:51:00,en

The information appears to have been made public under standard bankruptcy practice as Celsius, which froze customer accounts in July, is currently going through the Chapter 11 restructuring process. The disclosure affects almost 600,000 user accounts, exposing their wallet addresses, transaction histories, cryptocurrency holdings, most recent transactions and other data. The documents also showed how officials at Celsius were able to pull millions out of their accounts before the lender went bankrupt. The business sought to have the names of its users withheld, but the judge only permitted the redaction of user email and home addresses. The court documents that included information about Celsius users are reportedly the source of the Celsius Networth leaderboard.

cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson: There's Nothing Left to Say About XRP,"The  XRP  community's dispute with Charles Hoskinson might finally be over as the co-founder of the Cardano Network does not want to discuss this matter further and says that it is pointless. The dispute between the community and Charles Hoskinson started with the developer's comment in an interview regarding the situation with the SEC. He stated that the main reason behind the whole SEC v. Ripple trial is the lack of regulatory clarity and the commission's willingness to put every crypto project in the same regulatory framework they use for stocks. There is nothing more to say on this topic Wendy. All intellectual honesty has been lost in a social media mob. I stand by my statements. Further discussion is pointless. Time to move on. No one is going to apologize. The internet doesn't work that way. It is what it is After the interview was released, hundreds of users turned against Hoskinson, stating that he is in league with the SEC, and Cardano might even be part of a corrupt scheme in which they work against projects like Ripple. Despite all the allegations made by members of the  XRP  community, Ripple co-founders supported Hoskinson and said that the SEC indeed lacks any specific regulatory framework for cryptocurrency or blockchain projects. However, the support of the co-founders was not enough for some representatives of the XRP community, and they kept on attacking Hoskinson until he decided to limit users who expressed their opinions in the comments sections under his tweets. Thankfully, the drama between the developer and the community is finally over as he does not want to provide any further comments regarding this issue. Luckily, the drama between ADA and XRP representatives did not have any effect on the market performance of both assets. Cardano has been continuously moving down since Sept. 11, and XRP is successfully holding against the rising selling pressure and continuing its local uptrend, reaching a new local high of $0.55 recently.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-theres-nothing-left-to-say-about-xrp,utoday,2022-10-12,08:16:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here's How Much Cardano (ADA) You Will Earn by Staking for 5 Years,"Stacking on  Cardano  might not be the most popular option among cryptocurrency investors. However, it still beats traditional finance by a high margin as staking up to 100,000 ADA will give investors a 30% return in five years, data shows. Cardano can be staked on various platforms and wallets, including one of the largest centralized exchanges in the world, Binance. Unfortunately, the interest rate on the coin is constantly changing. Some solutions adjust their APY in accordance with the supply locked in staking. Usually, financial entities offer a higher staking rate if investors agree to lock their coins for a certain period of time. With the longer locking period, exchanges offer higher interest, and vice versa. The same rule applies to Cardano staking. A stable income in a certain currency might be a good idea if an investor is trying to build a portfolio based on a stable income. However, staking assets like Cardano, Ethereum or anything else liable to elevated volatility brings a lot of risks. If you stake 100,000 ADA on  #Cardano  for 5 years you will earn 30,000  $ADA . It is almost 1/3 of the coins with which you started. Compare it with your bank account.  pic.twitter.com/adWqb9qaDA Since most staking solutions with high interest require  investors  to lock their funds for a certain period of time, users would have no other choice but to face losses during periods of turbulence on financial markets. Additional risks are tied to increased selling pressure after the locking period. For example,  Ethereum  investors are bracing themselves for a volatility and selling volume spike after a massive release of coins from the staking solution locked ahead of the Merge. Luckily, it will not be the case for Cardano, as staking on this network is not the most popular solution for investors.",https://u.today/heres-how-much-cardano-ada-you-will-earn-by-staking-for-5-years,utoday,2022-10-12,12:44:00,en

Following the sell-off, ADA dipped to lows of $0.35 while trading at $0.363 currently. At the time of publication, ADA was down 10.53% in the last 24 hours, per  CoinMarketCap  data. ADA prices  have declined steadily in recent months. After topping $0.595 on Aug. 14, the ADA price failed to make further progress as it once again returned to trading beneath a bearish trendline. For veteran trader Peter Brandt, the path for ADA's price remains gloomy as he predicts a further decline below the $0.25 level based on a classic descending triangle pattern. The ""descending triangle"" chart pattern indicated by the veteran trader refers to a bearish signal that usually forms during a downtrend as a continuation pattern. ADA's price is currently at a critical juncture as a further 28% drop from current levels might bring to fruition Brandt's bearish prediction of sub-$0.25.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Says Bitcoin Mining Is Point of Contention for U.S. Lawmakers,"Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  says that there are some tensions in Washington regarding cryptocurrency mining since many lawmakers view Bitcoin as wasteful. ""Energy-producing states have an enormous excess of energy. For example, natural gas production crates flare gas, and capturing and using it for mining is a profitable endeavor…Other people say we are wasting electricity,"" he said during a recent live stream. There is a strong desire among left-leaning lawmakers to involve the Department of Energy in the mining conversation. There are some efforts to outlaw mining and replace proof of work with other consensus algorithms if miners cannot find a way to be carbon-neutral or negative. Hoskinson  believes that regulation by enforcement, which is being practiced by the SEC, is unlikely to be successful. There is still no clarity as to which cryptocurrencies can be classified as securities, in his view: How do we get to the point where we can determine whether a cryptocurrency is a security or a commodity? Hoskinson says that people tend to view blockchain technology as strictly a financial asset in many cases. However, he notes that it has profound applications for building resilient electrical grids and telecommunications grids, developing voting systems, storing health records and so on. He said: We need to broaden the scope of discussions around cryptocurrencies so that we understand that they do more than just one thing. The  Cardano  founder praised those lawmakers on both sides of the aisle who were open to working with the industry.

After downloading the application, users are asked to type in their seed phrase from the browser-based Nami wallet, which looks like an ordinary procedure when creating a wallet on a different device. However, that is not the case here. Instead of giving access to users' funds, the app steals the data and sends it to app developers, providing them with direct access to  Cardano  held on the legit browser-based Nami wallet. The appearance of the application on the marketplace has nothing to do with the developers of the official browser solution by Nami. Unfortunately, the fake wallet is still available for downloading on the platform, which means more users will become victims of hackers. The scheme used by the application is a common way of stealing digital assets. By creating fake applications or web services, developers make people believe that they are using authentic solutions and transfering sensitive data that gives access to funds. Previously, Twitter scammers were using phishing links in the comments sections of popular influencers. Once users proceeded to the website, they ended up on the page where they were promised more than a 100% profit for simply sending a certain amount of coins to an address. More sophisticated scammers asked users for their wallet details with the promise of sending them additional funds.

Now, the team offers the hacker to return the funds, allowing him to keep a percentage from it. Otherwise they threaten to launch a “wanted” campaign and give a reward to those who will help hunt the attacker down. According to the blog post, the attacker managed to change a stake key in the payment address, thus making the vending machine to shift crypto to the hacker’s wallet. The attacker managed to withdraw 5,554,113 XRAY (Ray Network’s native coin) and 112 XDIAMOND. Later he sold them for a total of 412,253 ADA on Minswap dex and Sundaeswap. The RayStake team say they know on which addresses the attacker holds the 412,253 ADA, publishing them in the blog post. The RayStake team has offered the hacker to settle this matter if he returns the  ADA  he got for the stolen funds to their address. In this case, they are willing to leave him 20 percent of that amount, pretending that he is a “white hat hacker”, who helped them find a vulnerability in the system. The total sum of ADA held by the hacker’s address at the moment is 4,600,000, plus the 412,000 he got for the stolen crypto. According to them, the hacker has left “a lot of digital footprints” that will help DPS Cyber Security keep him in their crosshairs.

Cardano, which was initially known as “Japanese Ethereum” shortly after its launch, is currently valued at $12.5 billion. While quite impressive, this is a drop in the bucket compared to Ethereum’s $156 billion. At its peak, the second-largest cryptocurrency was worth half a trillion dollars. Armstrong’s prediction was amplified by some overly optimistic members of the Cardano community who believe that such “flippening” is a real possibility in the long term.       His tweet also drew tongue-in-cheek replies from the Ethereum community.    “Intellectuals continue to embrace Cardano,” Nansen's Alex Svanevik joked. Armstrong’s dubious prediction should be taken with a big grain of salt given that the YouTuber has a somewhat notorious reputation within the cryptocurrency. As  reported by U.Today , BitBoy recently sued a fellow YouTuber after the latter accused him of promoting fraudulent cryptocurrency projects. The lawsuit ended up being a massive humiliation for Armstrong: he ended up withdrawing it after facing strong pushback from the community. Cardano’s ADA token has significantly underperformed Ethereum, declining more than 25%. As  reported by U.Today , the token is at risk of another 30% drop after forming a bearish pattern. The token benefited from the hype surrounding the Vasil hard fork last month, but it is now struggling to regain steam.         ",https://u.today/cardano-will-surpass-ethereum-top-crypto-youtuber-predicts,utoday,2022-10-16,11:33:00,en

The Cardano Developer Portal covers everything that could be done on the Cardano mainnet. Cardano has received a lot of criticism in the past, the most significant of which has been its comparison to a ghost chain. Cardano, however, continues to produce ghost-disproving results. One example is in its development activity. In recent months, Cardano's development activity has been on the rise, showing that the teams are day by day committed to creating products, polishing and upgrading their features and staying true to the long-term roadmap. Currently, the number of Plutus scripts has increased to 3,474. The continuously increasing number of Plutus scripts is a straight indicator of development activity in the ecosystem. According to recent statistics shared by the Cardano builder, IOG, 102 projects have been launched on Cardano. Cardano native tokens are now at 6.4 million across 63,064 token policies. The number of transactions stands at 51.8 million, while the number of projects building has grown to 1,120. In the past week, Input Output Global (IOG) has  announced  a new release for the Daedalus wallet — Daedalus mainnet 5.1.0, which brings updates to hardware wallet integration. In a historic milestone, the Vasil update was triggered on Sept. 22, while the full Vasil capabilities were deployed five days later, on Sept. 27, allowing developers to enjoy Vasil benefits.",https://u.today/cardano-ranks-among-top-blockchains-in-active-developer-count-details,utoday,2022-10-16,13:50:00,en

The reason for such categorical statements seems to be a surge of activity on Cardano NFT. bro SOL projects are dumping into oblivion and I just found out cardano NFTs are making all time highs According to  OpenCNFT , over the past 24 hours, NFT trading volume on Cardano has increased by 110%. At the same time, the number of trades increased by 36.6% and the number of items sold by 39%. In addition, the top 12  CNFT  collections have seen their values increase by at least 100% to 2,500% in the last 24 hours. Solana NFT's statistics look dismal against the backdrop of such multi-digit numbers, which must have been the reason for the resentment of NFT traders who favored this blockchain. So we all moving to Cardano NFTs now or what? Despite the emerging negativity of NFT market participants toward  Solana , the blockchain is cheerfully enough taking this market share away from Ethereum, the main one of them all. As reported by U.Today earlier, Solana's share of total NFT trading volume increased threefold from mid-August to the end of September, from 7% to 24%. The total number of wallets that have ever held an NFT has doubled this year, surpassing 6 million.  pic.twitter.com/F77tVx8DF3 Turning to the big picture of the NFT market, Delphi Digital's data shows that the number of wallets ever holding non-fungible tokens has doubled this year, reaching six million.

As an example, he chose Kanye West, whose account at JP Morgan was closed down last week. Hoskinson tackled the question that he has apparently been getting often from the crypto community — that is, wondering why companies in the crypto space that have their own coins are not good enough at marketing their assets and services. He believes that U.S. banks are much better at shilling crypto masses. As an example, he posted a picture with popular rapper Kanye West wearing a baseball cap that has an inscription that says, ""Satoshi Nakamoto."" The caption of the picture claims that the rapper, (now) Ye West, is now a Bitcoin fan after  JP Morgan banking giant terminated  a customer service contract with him three days ago and shut down his account. Prior to that, Twitter and Instagram social media giants also suspended the rapper billionaire's accounts for posting anti-semitic conspiracy theories. People keep asking why isn't the cryptocurrency space doing a better job at marketing, the answer is that every bank in America does a pretty good job of doing it for us  pic.twitter.com/OANsCCDPMw Kanye West is a famous advocate of crypto, and Bitcoin in particular. On June 1, the media reported that he filed 17 applications intending to start minting  his own branded NFTs . Curiously, in the winter, he stated that he would never be dealing with non-fungible tokens. Previously, U.Today reported that large U.S. banks had closed down accounts of Tron founder and its former CEO, Justin Sun, as well as former top executive of PayPal Roelof Botha.

IOTA, Ethereum Classic and Omisego ranked ahead of Cardano in the 11th, 12th and 13th spots, respectively. Exactly five years later, a great ""reshuffle"" has been seen. Cardano now ranks as the 8th largest cryptocurrency with a market valuation of $12.69 billion, a nearly 1,500% increase in its market cap from 2017. Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, Dash, NEM, Monero, Neo and Bitconnect are nowhere near the top 10. Bitcoin Cash ranks as the 31st largest cryptocurrency. Litecoin is currently the 20th largest crypto, NEO is the 65th largest, NEM is the 96th largest crypto asset and Bitconnect is nowhere to be found. Bitconnect was an open-source cryptocurrency that was connected to a high-yield investment program, a type of Ponzi scheme. Due to the founders' exit scam and accompanying legal issues, Bitconnect (BCC) is no longer trading on any legitimate exchanges as Bitconnect collapsed in 2018. In terms of market value, IOTA is presently the 60th-largest cryptocurrency, whereas Ethereum Classic is the 23rd largest. Cardano started as a federated network with just a few nodes over five years ago. Currently, Cardano has worked across five development themes (Byron, Shelley, Goguen, Basho, and Voltaire) with over 3,000 nodes and 6.4 million native tokens. The Vasil upgrade, ushering in the Babbage Era, was triggered on Sept. 22. Presently,  Cardano  ranks as the third largest proof-of-stake blockchain with a staking market cap of $9.89 billion.

MuesliSwap, which describes itself as the first decentralized exchange for Cardano and Milkomeda and the first Hybrid DEX on Cardano, launched its Plutus v2 contracts and liquidity pools on Oct. 5.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Takes Jab at Bitcoin SV,"Input Output CEO  Charles Hoskinson  has weighed in on Bitcoin SV’s recent predicament by recalling that Bitcoin founder was, in fact, a single miner on the popular blockchain during its early days. As  reported by U.Today , Bitcoin Association, a Switzerland-based nonprofit organization, announced that it would take legal action against a majority miner who is producing empty blocks while refusing to collect new transactions. Such malicious activity is negatively affecting other network participants, according to the organization. Bitcoin Association is also seeking to freeze the miner’s block rewards, depriving them of revenue. The announcement attracted plenty of ridicule within the cryptocurrency community, with some claiming that such legal action would be completely toothless. Even some members of the shrinking Bitcoin SV community were seemingly puzzled by such a move since they believe that miners are within their right to produce empty blocks. Bitcoin SV, which used to be a significant player in the crypto market after forking away from Bitcoin Cash during a bitter divorce in late 2018, has largely faded into obscurity.

cardano, Altcoin Watch , Cardano price chart paints 'Burj Khalifa' with 7-month losing streak — More losses ahead? ,"Cardano ( ADA ) price is in the process of painting its seventh red monthly candle in a row as the token fell to its lowest level since February 2021. The trend saw ADA's price rising nearly 800% to $3.16 between February 2021 and September 2021, followed by a complete wipeout of those gains entering October 2022. Amusingly, the entire price action took the shape of the ""Burj Khalifa,"" the world's tallest skyscraper in Dubai. Ada Khalifa  pic.twitter.com/KE2SxTO3bN — Trader_J (@Trader_Jibon)  October 19, 2022 
 
 ADA price eyes 35% price crash The ADA price correction began primarily in the wake of a similar downtrend across the cryptocurrency market, led by the Federal Reserve's  aggressive interest rate hikes  to tame rising inflation. Even an optimistic  Cardano network upgrade dubbed Vasil  was not enough to bring its buyers back to the market. Notably,  ADA's price has dropped  by nearly 20% since the Vasil hard fork nearly a month ago — an update aimed at improving its network's scalability and smart contract capabilities.  Moreover, the ADA/USD pair also broke below a key support level that may lead to another major crash ahead in Q4. The said support level at around $0.42 constitutes a descending triangle, a continuation pattern. In other words, ADA's potential to continue its prevailing downtrend becomes higher if it forms and breaks out of a descending triangle to the downside. ADA/USD three-day price chart featuring descending triangle breakdown. Source: TradingView Meanwhile, as a rule of technical analysis, a descending triangle breakdown during a downtrend typically pushes the price lower to a level at length equal to the pattern's maximum height. Therefore, ADA risks dropping toward $0.248, or by 35%, if the descending triangle breakdown plays out. $ADA  now losing the lights out level and going to the place where coins go when they die. Prob got a -50% in it from that breakdown level imo And I'm by no means picking on it.

 Conversely, a retest followed by a close above the triangle's lower trendline as resistance raises ADA's possibility to invalidate the bearish outlook. In doing so, it could trigger a descending channel setup forming simultaneously with the ascending triangle, as shown below. ADA/USD three-day price chart featuring descending channel pattern. Source: TradingView The descending channel setup sees ADA bouncing from its lower trendline to test the upper trendline near $0.45 as its immediate upside target. In other words, a 30% interim price rebound. Macro risks remain Overall, Cardano continues to tread ahead under macro risks, primarily after  September's 8.2% inflation reading , which raised the possibility of the Fed continuing its rate hike spree for the remainder of 2022. Risk assets across the board have witnessed a decline in individual investors' enthusiasm, which was instrumental in pushing thcryptocurrency prices higher in 2020 and 2021. For instance, Robinhood CEO Vlad Tenev  noted : ""2020 and 2021, people were really interested in investing in stocks. There was widespread participation in the stock market. Now people are talking about gas prices and inflation.” ADA, whose positive correlation coefficient with the U.S. benchmark S&P 500 has remained above $0.80 for most of 2022, also witnessed a sharp decline in its daily active addresses (DAA) since November 2021's market top.

cardano,No Section,"E-Smitty Says XRP Might Hit Five Digits, SHIB Trading Volume Jumps 30%, Two Major Market Players to Support Ripple in SEC Case: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","U.Today presents you with the top four news stories over the past day. U.S. record producer Eric Finnerud, also known as  E-Smitty  among professional musicians, has recently taken to Twitter to share a prediction on the XRP price. According to him, the Ripple-affiliated token will not only hit $1,000, but will also reach five digits and then go even higher.  Previously , E-Smitty stated that XRP will soon be adopted by the entire world, adding that he pays royalties to the musicians he collaborates with using XRP and accepts payments in this cryptocurrency for mixing, mastering, producing and marketing. The idea of XRP skyrocketing in the future is also supported by David Gokhshtein: he claims that if Ripple wins in its legal battle against the SEC, XRP will soar along with the entire crypto market. Despite the recent market drop,  Shiba Inu  saw its trading volume surge 30%, per CoinMarketCap data. Yesterday, 15.8 trillion SHIB worth $160 million was swapped. Higher trading volumes for most crypto assets are frequently caused by increased volatility as experienced traders buy and sell large quantities to capture profits. As a result, investors may have begun to accumulate SHIB to take advantage of the opportunity presented by the recent SHIB consolidation at $0.000010, which led to the increase in the SHIB trading volume. At the moment of writing, the meme coin is changing hands at $0.0000102, according to CoinMarketCap. As shared by @CryptoLawUS, two more  big market players , Phillip Goldstein, co-creator of Bulldog Investors private fund, and ICAN (Investor Choice Advocates Network), decided to support Ripple in its case against the SEC. Both Goldstein and ICAN intend to file an amicus brief to the court, representing the interests of market participants generally and in the particular case of Ripple and the SEC. By submitting the brief, the parties are urging the court to grant the motion of the defendants for summary judgment. The goal of the new amicus brief is to emphasize exactly why the efforts undertaken by the SEC to gain control over cryptocurrencies and other digital assets is ""an impermissible and unauthorized exercise of regulatory power."" Yesterday,  Milkomeda  blockchain interoperability provider announced that its A1 Rollup went live on the Algorand mainnet. The A1 Rollup uses wrapped ALGOs, called milkALGOs, as its base currency. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson gave a shout-out to Milkomeda’s achievement, tweeting “And by the power of blockchain transitivity, Algorand is now on Cardano” with a Star Wars-themed GIF saying “Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen.” Fundamentally, Cardano, which operates a UTxO architecture, and Algorand, which utilizes the Algorand Virtual Machine (AVM) that operates on an account-based model, are unable to exchange assets or communicate with one another. However, thanks to the Milkomeda A1 rollup, Algorand and Cardano can now be connected.",https://u.today/e-smitty-says-xrp-might-hit-five-digits-shib-trading-volume-jumps-30-two-major-market-players-to,utoday,2022-10-20,14:57:00,en

Such measures as slashing or leaking should be considered only for massive reorganization of other people’s blocks. Validators should decide what transactions should be included in their blocks, according to Buterin. Otherwise, the Ethereum community risks turning into “morality police,” according to the Canadian programmer. After Ethereum’s transition to the proof-of-stake algorithm, validators are not responsible for adding transactions to their blocks. Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of Gnosis, shared Buterin’s sentiment, arguing that validators have to be tolerated in such a scenario. Hoskinson has been critical of Ethereum recently. Last month, he said that it was “a crime” for the Ethereum community to even discuss  Cardano .",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-on-ethereum-there-arent-lines-that-cant-be-crossed,utoday,2022-10-20,10:05:00,en

Santiment observes that the majority of altcoin traders are now shorting more than longing. It notes that, based on historical precedents, when funding rates show significant shorts, liquidations are more common and surprise bounces can occur. 📉 With  #crypto  markets declining Thursday, short positions are opening up in large quantities for most  #altcoins  as traders try to profit from prices dropping. Historically, when funding rates show significant shorts,  #liquidations  are more common and surprise bounces can occur.  pic.twitter.com/ZsURzQLVsM The crypto market saw fresh declines in Friday trading, with Bitcoin dipping below the $19K mark once more. The majority of altcoins recorded bigger losses than Bitcoin. Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Uniswap (UNI) are down 5.14%, 6.14% and 8.09% in the last 24 hours. As the market experiences losses, macro traders anticipating a sustained decrease in the market's value run the danger of being caught off guard by a potential short squeeze, which is a sharp rise in price caused by bears caving in on their bearish bets. Santiment predicts a ""likely"" rise as altcoin funding rates show significant shorts. Most often, a short squeeze happens when the market has higher-than-normal bearish activity. In these circumstances, even a small price increase might cause bears or short sellers to scramble to square off their positions, which in turn pushes prices higher. The rebound of risky assets has been restrained by the absence of a strong catalyst and the strength of the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). Bitcoin is still struggling to break free of its constricting range. The more time Bitcoin spends trading within the range, the higher the possibility of an eventual breakout. Dan Gambardello , Cryptocapital founder, remains bullish on ADA: ""ADA outperformed in the bull market & there were crazy hype headlines. Now ADA is underperforming in the bear market & there are crazy fear headlines.

cardano,Markets,"Smart Money Eyes Market-Neutral Trades as ADA, AXS See Unusually Low Funding Rates","While you continue to fret over the broader market lull, remember there are always opportunities out there and they often present themselves in different ways. For instance, holding a short position (a bearish bet) in the perpetual futures market tied to Cardano's ADA and play-to-earn giant Axie Infinity's AXS token has become unusually costly, creating a window of opportunity for market-neutral traders to make attractive returns, according to Markus Thielen, head of research at strategy at Matrixport, a crypto services provider with $10 billion in assets under management. In a note sent to clients early Friday, Thielen said ADA's annualized funding rate, or the cost of keeping long (bullish)/short (bearish) positions open, has dropped to an average of -14% across major exchanges – a rare occurrence in the past eight months. As a result, traders can purchase ADA perpetual contracts and simultaneously sell ADA tokens in the spot market to safely pocket the funding rate. The funding rate is charged every eight hours. A negative rate, as in ADA's case, means positioning is skewed bearish and short sellers are paying longs to keep short positions open. This chart shows perpetual funding rates for major cryptocurrencies. (Matrixport) So, suppose an entity opens a long position in the ADA perpetual futures market right now. In that case, it will receive an annualized funding rate of 14% – an attractive yield, considering the U.S. 10-year Treasury note yields just over 4%. The long trade, however, is unhedged. If ADA's price tanks, the resulting loss could be more significant than the 14% yield generated from the funding rate. The entity can eliminate the risk by selling ADA tokens in the spot market, thereby creating a market-neutral position. ""Long ADA Perp at -14% to -23% discount vs. Short Cardano's ADA spot Tokens,"" Thielen recommended in a client note. ""You can currently make 14% profit by purchasing perpetual future, borrowing the ADA tokens from a firm like Matrixport, and selling those. If and when the spot price and perpetual futures converge, you should make a 14% profit return,"" Thielen told CoinDesk. Note that the rate at which tokens are borrowed needs to be lower than the funding yield, or else the market-neutral strategy will yield a loss. ADA traded at 35 cents at press time, down 2% on the day. The token has lost over 20% since Cardano implemented the Vasil  hard fork  on Sep 26, seeking to boost security, scalability and transaction speeds. AXS funding rate drops to -56% The bear grip around AXS has strengthened, pushing the funding rate to a whopping -56%, as 10 million tokens belonging to insiders and early investors  will be released  into the market soon. A market-neutral strategy of buying AXS perpetual contracts and selling borrowed AXS tokens will earn an annualized return of 56% (excluding the cost of borrowing AXS tokens). According to Thielen, the token unlock could happen next week. ""While the exact date is determined by the transaction block number, by some estimates, the vesting period ends approximately around Oct. 24-26,"" Thielen said.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/21/smart-money-eyes-market-neutral-trades-as-ada-axs-see-unusually-low-funding-rates/,coindesk,2022-10-21,14:07:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder Says ""Something Special"" Is Coming in November","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson  has teased  the Cardano community with a new announcement earlier today.  The prominent cryptocurrency enthusiast claims that “something special” is coming in November without going further into details. Hoskinson attached an animated GIF with the “Good News Everyone!” catchphrase said by the character Professor Farnsworth from the 1999 animated TV show Futurama. The meme is commonly used by anyone who talks about anything good in particular.  Cardano rolled out its much-anticipated Vasil upgrade in September after months of delays. The ADA token, which saw a significant rally in the run-up to the upgrade, has failed to make any headway since then.   During a recent chat with popular YouTuber Ben Armstrong, Hoskinson said that the Cardano network was in the “wait-and-see” phase following the release of the Vasil hard fork.  Hoskinson claims that he expects a lot of things on the partnership side to happen (especially when it comes to bridges, standards, and certifications).    The convergence of the  metaverse , GameFi and non-fungible tokens on Cardano was “the biggest surprise,” Hoskinson says. “It’s brought a lot of new actors into our space,” he added.  As  reported by U.Today , Hoskinson recently attracted backlash from the XRP community for describing its members’ allegations against the SEC as a “grand conspiracy.” Hoskinson has reiterated that XRP fans are “muddying the waters” with their statements while making it more difficult for the industry to support Ripple.  He has stressed that he doesn’t want to go down the road of accusing the entire government agency of criminal conduct. Hoskinson also slammed the “free pass” narrative pushed by XRP fans, claiming that they are fomenting divisiveness instead of gaining much-needed allies. ",https://u.today/cardano-founder-says-something-special-is-coming-in-november,utoday,2022-10-23,11:00:00,en

According to @shibaplay_ Twitter user, on Saturday, large whales performed  SHIB transfers  worth $1,221,947 and $1,049,707 (121,829,226,162 and 104,656,752,200, respectively). Per data provided by Etherscan, these whales have been redistributing their crypto riches. Meanwhile, just hours before these transfers took place, Shiba Inu was added by FCF Pay crypto payment gateway to its prepaid debit cards. The company previously reported that the cards could be used to access goods and services on Amazon and Netflix, meaning that from now on, SHIB holders can pay these two giants with their favorite meme coin. Citaldoc , one of the leading telemedicine applications in Latin America, started testing ADA for its telemedicine services payment module. The platform’s team shared a screenshot on Twitter, showing a successful 10,000 ADA test transaction processed by Cardano's testing network. As commented by the team in the same tweet, this milestone is ""emotional"" for them, as crypto integration is crucial for Citaldoc's accessibility to both current and potential customers. Citaldoc representatives announced that $1,000,000 in ADA tokens would be enough to fuel the next phase of crypto adoption in telemedicine. As previously  reported  by U.Today, Ripple collected statements from 3,000 XRP holders to involve them in the lawsuit against the SEC. The collection of XRP holders' notarized testimonies (affidavits) was made possible thanks to John Deaton, pro-XRP lawyer and activist. Another attorney,  Jeremy Hogan , has not left the news unnoticed and commented that bringing in the affidavits of XRP holders is the last piece of the puzzle in Ripple’s case.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Transactions Volume Reaches Lowest Level Since January, Bounce Ahead?","According to data from  Messari  on-chain tracker, Cardano is facing a severe drop in network activity as its transaction volume dropped to a level unseen since January 2022. Such a strong drop could be the result of the most recent price action of  ADA , and it desperately needs a bounce. The downtrend on  Cardano  is not something that would surprise anyone who works with the cryptocurrency market, as ADA remains one of the least profitable cryptocurrencies in the whole industry. However, the price action that began on Oct. 10 was not expected by the majority of the market. The 21% crash corresponded with a noteworthy spike in volatility. Prior to the dump, Cardano has been moving in the usual manner: low volatility, some swings up and then continuation of the downtrend. Almost a two-time spike in  volatility  caused a panic among retail investors that fueled the plunge, causing the biggest volume spike since the middle of September. The massive plunge in transactional volume on the network could be a sign of fear among investors and a lack of activity in the ecosystem as a whole. With negative price performance, investors avoid making unnecessary transactions or stop their buying activities. Decentralized finance that provides a small percentage of the existing volume on Cardano becomes less popular as traders in fear tend to move assets to private storage rather than keeping funds on exchanges or DeFi platforms. Luckily, ADA has been showing some bounce potential by gaining 9% to its value in the last four days, showing that bulls may still provide enough buying volume to push it back to pre-drop values.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-transactions-volume-reaches-lowest-level-since-january-bounce-ahead,utoday,2022-10-24,11:50:00,en

However, statements from the exchange's head, Sam Bankman-Fried, have raised a number of conflicting expectations. In particular, the threat that a listing of ADA on FTX could pose to Cardano was  expressed  by Ben ""BitBoy"" Armstrong, a well-known crypto influencer, with whom Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson himself soon engaged in a discussion. If FTX lists ada, then my understanding is that the ada accounts on Voyager won't be liquidated According to Armstrong,  Cardano  enthusiasts should be concerned that with the listing of the spot pair, FTX could make a forced liquidation of all ADA positions open with the bankrupt crypto broker Voyager, whose asset sale deal was approved in favor of FTX. In opposition to him, Charles Hoskinson believes that his understanding is that if FTX includes ADA in its quotation lists, then ADA accounts on Voyager should not be liquidated. Nevertheless, the Cardano founder does not seem to have much confidence when he says that he would be furious if such a thing were to happen. Bankman-Fried himself has not yet commented on the situation. The final outcome of FTX's acquisition of  Voyager  will be known at the end of November, after a vote by creditors passes. ADA remained the only top cryptocurrency so far not listed on the exchange which, according to the founder, was due to technical peculiarities.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Is in Midst of Network Activity Bullrun and Daily Transactions, Here's Why","According to Cardano's on-chain  metrics , the  Ethereum  competitor is currently going through a network activity and daily transaction bullrun despite the negative price performance of ADA we have been seeing on the market for the last few weeks. The daily transaction count on the network trends toward 100K at a blockchain load of 50%. The most likely reason behind an unexpected run in terms of network activity and daily transactions is the sudden recovery of the NFT industry that used to bring the major part of the transactional volume to networks like Ethereum. The number of transactions, average number of transactions per block and 24-hour  addresses activity  are all on the rise, seeming to be in an uptrend. Such a tendency is also a positive factor for ADA as an investment tool. The fundamental growth of the network has always been a more important factor for digital assets in comparison to the short- or even midterm price performance on the market. During Ethereum's activity rally, the price of the second biggest  cryptocurrency  on the market ran to the current all-time high of $4,850. Unfortunately, Cardano developers could not deliver NFT technologies during the bullrun on the cryptocurrency market, which is why the network missed that wave of new investors who were looking for short-term profit on the Ethereum and Solana networks. Luckily, DeFi is gaining more traction on ADA, and it will most likely help it to attract a wave of mainstream investors in case of the recovery of the digital assets industry. As for now, Cardano's underlying cryptocurrency, ADA, is changing hands on the market at $0.35 with a 0.64% price increase in the last 24 hours.",https://u.today/cardano-is-in-midst-of-network-activity-bullrun-and-daily-transactions-heres-why,utoday,2022-10-25,11:38:00,en

They believe so because they would rather invest in crypto ""following greater enforcement action."" In this regard, many investors have changed their expectations toward  Bitcoin  from what they stated in July. Now, they believe that BTC will remain above the $17,600 level, going up to $25,000 at least until 2022 is over.

Nearly 60% of the 564 people involved in the survey said they believe so. The recent investigations of the securities regulator include Three Arrows Capital and Celsius Network (both of which went bankrupt), and Yuga Labs, which created the NFT collection Bored Ape. One of the respondents, President of World Markets for TIAA Bank Chris Gaffney, said he believes these investigations to be positive because when there is more regulation on the crypto market, it will stop being ""the Wild West"" and will be more like a traditional investment tool, becoming ""better off."" This wave of positive expectations has extended to Bitcoin. The majority of investors who participated in the survey have become more bullish on BTC price compared to their opinion back in July. Until the end of 2022, they believe, the flagship cryptocurrency will remain range-bound between the levels of $17,600 and $25,000. Compared to this, in July, they had expectations of BTC dropping to $10,000 and then rising back to the $30,000 line. However, Bloomberg adds, in this past survey they had more options to choose from rather than in the summer. Being down around 60% this year, the leading crypto, Bitcoin, has been trading in a range between $18,171 and $25,203 since July, when the previous survey was conducted.

Hoskinson claims that he’s willing to do the migration for free, adding that he would be able to add smart contracts.  The Cardano founder believes that there is “a real possibility” that the largest meme coin will “somehow merge” with the platform. As reported by U.Today, Tesla CEO Elon Musk took control of Twitter on Oct. 27 after buying the social media platform for $44 billion.  The price of Dogecoin saw a  significant rally  earlier this week after it became known that Musk would be in charge of the social media platform by the end of the week. However, the canine token is up only by a modest 2.2% over the past 24 hours.     Musk has repeatedly hinted that the meme cryptocurrency, which he has repeatedly promoted,  would be part of Twitter  if he were to take over. However, he is yet to outline any concrete plans for the joke cryptocurrency. While the Dogecoin community celebrates the purchase, many pundits believe Musk’s Twitter ownership will make it easier to spread misinformation and target marginalized groups of people with hate speech on the popular social media platform due to lenient moderation policies. The Tesla CEO has been repeatedly criticized for posting inflammatory tweets and amplifying extremists. ",https://u.today/dogecoin-should-be-cardano-sidechain-charles-hoskinson-says,utoday,2022-10-28,19:28:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cryptocurrency ETFs Record Worst Debuts in History,"According to a  Friday report  published by the Financial Times, cryptocurrency exchange-traded funds that were launched in late 2021 have had an extremely underwhelming year. In fact, they now account for five of the seven most disastrous ETF debuts in history. The thematic cryptocurrency's funds were unlucky enough to launch near the peak of the last cryptocurrency rally, which resulted in tremendous losses. As  reported by U.Today , ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF (BITO), which was the first Bitcoin futures ETF approved in the U.S., lost a whopping $1.2 billion worth of investors' funds over the past year. This makes it the worst-performing ETF ever in dollar terms. This is a sharp turnaround for the ETF that became the second highest traded fund in history on its debut day due to overwhelming demand. Notably, Bitcoin reached its all-time peak of $69,000 in less than a month after BITO's much-hyped debut. Melanion BTC Equities Universe Ucits ETF, which offers investors exposure to various cryptocurrency companies, is the biggest laggard percentage-wise after declining roughly 77% over the past 12 months. The report suggests that there is still a chance that cryptocurrency ETFs will somehow manage to rebound after a disastrous 2022, if history is any guide. For instance, the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF saw more than half of its funds evaporate in 12 months during the early 2000s. Now, it is a $12.2 billion giant. As reported by U.Today, a  recent survey  published by Fidelity shows that institutional investors largely remain bullish on crypto despite the market rout.",https://u.today/cryptocurrency-etfs-record-worst-debuts-in-history,utoday,2022-10-28,14:47:00,en

Shibburn’s data from yesterday demonstrated  a huge burn rate spike  by 14,267%, with the number of destroyed tokens not massive. According to Shibburn, around 14.07 million tokens — worth roughly $155 at that time — were sent to dead wallets. Meanwhile, SHIB’s market cap has also touched the $6 billion mark for the first time in 17 days. At the same time, the meme coin’s price saw a 7% surge to $0.000011, which followed after Luxembourg-based cryptocurrency exchange Bitstamp listed it for customers in the U.S. At the moment of writing, however, SHIB lost its gains and is changing hands at $0.00001071. XRP Ledger Services, the website that tracks XRPL's performance,  reports  that the current number of XRP accounts is 4,342,550. The total quantity of XRP held by these accounts is 55.7 billion, of which 43.425 million XRP represents the amount of reserves that are blocked when the wallet is created. Another interesting statistic is how few empty XRP wallets there actually are. According to recent data, only 948 of the many millions of XRP accounts do not contain anything. Thus, the number of empty XRP accounts is only 0.02% of the total. The portal also discloses that out of the total of 99.99 billion XRPs in circulation, 44.3 billion XRP are held in escrow accounts. In a recent tweet, stock brokerage app  Robinhood  announced that it enables transfers for Aave (AAVE), Stellar (XLM) and Tezos (XTZ). From now on, users can send and receive these cryptocurrencies on Robinhood. Earlier this week, Robinhood listed Tezos (XTZ) and AAVE DeFi token. They are the most recent cryptocurrency assets to be introduced to Robinhood, which has 18.7 million active monthly users. In August, Robinhood listed Stellar (XLM) alongside Avalanche (AVAX), enabling transfers for Avalanche last September. Last month, Robinhood also listed its first stablecoin, USDC. The cryptocurrency community has recently spotted the two biggest meme coins,  Shiba Inu and Dogecoin , on the Cardano network: the assets could be seen on popular Cardano tracking and analysis platform TipTool. However, it might not be safe to use them. Per underlying data, both SHIB and DOGE currently have no bridging and are controlled by only a few wallets. This raises serious concerns since users' funds might end up in the hands of scammers.

cardano,No Section,Dogecoin Price Springs 29% as Chances to Be Adopted by Twitter Rise,"Today, the most popular meme coin and the potential crypto of Twitter, as many in the  DOGE  army believe it to be, has skyrocketed by almost 30 percent. This has happened on the second day after the official announcement that Tesla boss has taken over Twitter “out of love to humanity” as he stated in one of his recent tweets. Now many believe that the centibillionaire Musk will make Dogecoin the currency of Twitter or at least one of its payment/tipping options, including such influencers as David Gokhshtein and Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson. On Friday, Hoskinson tweeted that as Musk finally bought the social media platform, he indeed believes that DOGE has a real possibility to be somehow merged with Twitter. Now that Twitter is in the hands of  @elonmusk  I can see a real possibility that doge will somehow merge with the platform. What is more, Charles said that he reckons  DOGE should be a sidechain of Cardano . He offered doing a migration for free and even said he would add smart contracts. As for an opportunity to integrate Dogecoin, earlier this year, when Musk was invited to join the board of Twitter, he suggested adding DOGE as a payment option for the Twitter Blue subscriptions. The DOGE army since then has been looking forward to Musk purchasing the microblogging platform.  It finally happened  this week after the price of $44 billion was paid.

Cardano  will obviously be the preferred choice. On June 22, Hoskinson shared a teaser-tweet in which he announced the opening of Nessie's restaurant and a whiskey lounge in Wheatland, Wyoming, the city where Hoskinson lives. The business choice made some of his followers curious as the restaurant business and cryptocurrency development are industries that do not cross that often. Yes However, the main reason behind opening the restaurant was the lack of good options in the town nearby Hoskinson's ranch. During the announcement, Hoskinson confirmed that his restaurant will be crypto-friendly and has recently made the same claim again. Some users suggested that Hoskinson should think about alternative Cardano-based payment options like the DJED stablecoin that has been brought up in the pro-Cardano narrative. By implementing the stablecoin in the business, the Cardano co-founder would be able to create a real-world use case for the asset immediately after the full launch. Through the last year, Cardano's ecosystem saw exponential growth in the number of new solutions and use cases. The network became completely ready for the implementation of NFTs. The DeFi side of the ecosystem also received a massive boost despite the problematic nature of the eUTxO mechanism in terms of handling numerous transactions in one block. Decentralized finance solutions are now working on the network stably. Unfortunately, the price performance of Cardano still remains problematic as the asset cannot break the local resistance level at $0.41.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-is-ready-to-accept-cardano-in-his-own-restaurant,utoday,2022-10-30,10:20:00,en

The Cardano founder, Charles Hoskinson, rushed to join the topic and moreover  proposed  to create a new version of the main memecoin — post-quantum ultrafast DOGE on Cardano. Although 80% of the vote was in favor, not everyone liked Hoskinson's proposal, in particular the creator of Dogecoin, Billy Markus, alias Shibetoshi Nakamoto. According to Markus, the  Cardano  founder's offer is hypocritical, because he previously hated Dogecoin and even recorded a video in April 2021 where he extremely harshly called DOGE a bubble. Dogecoin finally has a use case. If elon decides to use it for twitter, then there are automatically 200 million users and a usecase. That's a lot more real than memes Hoskinson countered that claim by asserting that with Elon Musk's arrival on Twitter, DOGE would get real use and a user base of 200 million people. However, in Dogecoin founder's opinion, that does not change the matter, at least not yet. Against the backdrop of the Cardano and Dogecoin squabbles, it is amusing that  DOGE  has overtaken ADA in  CoinMarketCap's  ranking of the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, thanks to the price action of recent days. However, ADA itself has also risen over the past seven days, and the cryptocurrency closed the week 17% higher than its opening price on Monday.

cardano,No Section,Dogecoin (DOGE) Ahead of Cardano After Explosive Price Performance,"The lack of momentum on Cardano is nothing new for cryptocurrency  investors . However, falling back below the top eight of the cryptocurrency market is more about Dogecoin's explosive price performance rather than the lack of movement on  ADA . Unfortunately, ADA is still struggling with the local resistance level at the 50-day moving average, and the main reason behind it is the lack of inflows to the asset. The recovery of the cryptocurrency market helps Cardano return to the level prior to the Oct. 11 dump, but a recovery from it seems like an unlikely scenario. At press time,  Cardano  is trying to break the 50-day moving average, but the lack of volume on the weekend market remains a problem as the cryptocurrency cannot gain enough momentum to do so. Unfortunately, the sixth attempt to break from the prolonged downtrend might be as unsuccessful as the others, considering the current state of ADA on the market. Since the start of the rally, DOGE is showing a mind-blowing 140% price increase in the last 24 hours. Following the Twitter acquisition by Elon Musk, a lot of investors believe in the possibility of Dogecoin being implemented on social media as a payment tool. Obviously, that would increase the market capitalization and usage of DOGE exponentially, making it one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world. However, Musk himself stated that he does not plan on making the social network blockchain-based as it would create a lot of problems and most likely would not work out.

Woods responded to the tweet of Cardano and IOHK founder Charles Hoskinson, published on Friday, that since Elon Musk now has Twitter entirely in his hands, there could be a real possibility that Dogecoin would actually be merged with the platform somehow. Woods tweeted that it would be a ""real shame"" considering the great amount of engineering and innovation that is being added into the Cardano and Algorand chains, basically hinting that DOGE has not seen much innovative development in its 10-year history of existence. Which would be a real shame given the strength of engineering and innovation being put into projects like Cardano and Algorand. As a reminder, this fall, Cardano has implemented two long-expected upgrades — Alonzo, which brought smart contracts to this network — and Vasil after being delayed from June due to major technical difficulties.  Vasil hard fork  was implemented shortly after Etherum's Merge, which moved the second largest blockchain to proof-of-stake tracks, making it less energy-consuming. Vasil has made Cardano more efficient and cost-effective due to Plutus 2.0 — the new version of the specially created programming language for Cardano. The Cardano founder and CEO responded to Woods' tweet about his grudges that DOGE might be integrated on Twitter, rather than on ADA or Algo. Hoskinson provided a version of why Elon Musk might be doing what he is doing: paying $44 billion for Twitter and perhaps integrating DOGE later on. Hoskinson compared this to erecting a building in a place where a person is very much fond of the view. They will build regardless of the numerous snags they hit — ""terrible soil, snake problem, loud road, flooding,"" etc. Still, in one of his comments to his root tweet, Hoskinson said that he believes  DOGE should be a sidechain  of Cardano. He stated that he would provide migration free of charge and would even add smart contracts to DOGE.

The tweet quickly gained traction among the SHIB army, gathering 5,053 comments with a variety of responses, such as “Doge killer,” “hope,” “the best cryptocurrency,” etc. The official Twitter handle of Shiba Inu frequently posts updates about the SHIB ecosystem and hints related to its metaverse. Meanwhile, major long-expected Layer 2 upgrade “Shibarium” is still incomplete and has not been launched yet, despite users continuously asking “wen Shibarium?” According to an official announcement, SWIFT, a global financial messaging service, has accepted its community request to start ISO 20022 migration in March 2023. ISO 20022 is a global data standard for modern payment messaging between financial institutions and payment systems. While most payment systems in both Europe and the U.S. plan to migrate to this standard either in spring 2023 (the ECB, Clearing House Automated Payment System [CHAPS], FedNow) or spring 2025 (Fedwire),  RippleNet  network was designed from the start with ISO 20022 standards in mind. In 2020, Ripple joined the ISO 20022 Registration Management Group (RMG) standards body, becoming the first member focused on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT). Elon Musk's finalization of his Twitter purchase has caused quite a stir around  Dogecoin  and its potential adoption by the social media giant.

With the Oct. 31 announcement of the full launch, GameStop’s market will allow for popular Web3 games on ImmutableX such as the  role-playing game Illuvium  and Gods Unchained to be accessed by users. GameStop has worked to launch a series of Web3-powered products over the past year, with a  beta self-custody crypto wallet  released in May that integrates with its NFT marketplace.  In March, the retailer also launched its first  beta NFT marketplace on Loopring , an Ethereum-based layer-2 protocol.

Art Gobblers makes over $20M hours after launch NFT project Art Gobblers, created by Justin Roiland, the co-creator of the popular animated show Rick and Morty, has seen nearly $20.5 million in Ether ( ETH ) volumes just seven hours after launch. The project is a collaboration between Roiland and venture capital firm Paradigm, and describes itself as an “experimental decentralized art factory.”  According  to  Blur  data, the project is seeing strong launch success, with 12,906 ETH in volume at the time of writing.  According to a Paradigm overview, the Art Gobblers ecosystem is  intended  to work by financially incentivizing artists and collectors in a feedback loop for both to contribute to the project, either with better art or more money. A diagram explaining the intention of the Art Gobblers ecosystem.

These NFTs can then be “eaten” by an Art Gobbler, which will store the artwork in its “belly gallery” with the NFT artwork associated with that Gobbler on-chain. The project also enacts other deflationary measures such as restricting the amount of NFTs that can be minted and mechanisms that automatically adjust prices in coordination with an issuance schedule. The initial mint saw 2,000 “Gobblers” minted, with the community expected to spend GOO tokens to mint a further 8,000 over the next 10 years. Cardano NFTs hit third place for trading volume Cardano NFTs surged in trading volume over the past month, placing the blockchain in third place,  according  to an Oct. 27 report by analytics platform DappRadar. The report said in the last 30 days, Cardano’s NFT volume reached $191 million, bringing it to the third-largest NFT protocol behind Ethereum and Solana. Related:  An introduction to decentralized NFT catalogs The blockchain’s popular NFT marketplace JPG Store saw a 40% increase in trading volume in the last 30 days also which reached a value of $11.2 million. DappRadar attributes the surge to the blockchain’s  Vasil hard fork upgrade  that went live on Sep. 22, which brought with it increased efficiency for its smart contracts allowing decentralized applications to deploy and run at lower costs.

cardano,No Section,"David Gokhshtein to “Go Out and Buy SHIB,” Cardano Founder Speaks on Musk, DOGE and Twitter, Whales Move 4.2 Trillion SHIB: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","The last day of October was quite eventful for the crypto industry. Let’s take a look at the major highlights from yesterday with U.Today’s top four stories. In a recent tweet,  David Gokhshtein , influencer and founder of Gokhshtein Media, has shared his plans to ""go all out and buy more SHIB,"" warning his followers not to try and stop him. He then revealed the sum he is going to spend on acquiring additional meme coins, $33: at the current exchange rate, this is worth 2,682,926 SHIB. The purchase followed Gokhshtein’s confession in early October, when the influencer tweeted that he  should have gone all in on Shiba Inu . According to the tweet, the only thing that stopped him was his confusion with the tagline ""Dogecoin killer"" that was attached to SHIB. According to data provided by Twitter user @shibaplay_, yesterday, whales shifted more than  4.18 trillion SHIB  in three big transactions worth 3,369,887,165,968; 449,380,140,957 and 417,084,768,611 meme coins. Per Etherscan, the first lump was transferred between anonymous wallets, with one of them belonging to a crypto exchange, as one commentator suggested. The other two transfers were conducted by the Binance exchange internally, Etherscan reported. This impressive amount of SHIB was moved while the coin’s price started to reverse after a recent massive pump: from Oct. 23 to 27, SHIB demonstrated a 17% rise, but yesterday it showed a drop by more than 10%. However, SHIB is now trading up 4.22% over the past 24 hours, at $0.00001273. Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  has recently gotten into a discussion on possible DOGE integration into Twitter with Cardano's former director of architecture John Woods. It all started with Hoskinson’s tweet, in which he suggested that Elon Musk’s acquisition of the social media giant could indeed result in the meme coin merging into the platform. Woods replied, saying that it ""would be a real shame"" given the engineering advancement of both Cardano and Algorand and hinting at the lack of said advancement on Dogecoin. In a reply to his former colleague, the Cardano CEO tried to provide a possible explanation for Musk’s current actions. He compared the Twitter purchase to building a house in a certain place just because the future owner likes the view, regardless of numerous issues it may cause. “But if you're crazy rich, then you can make it work,” Hoskinson concluded. Yesterday, the burn rate of  Shiba Inu  reached an astounding 1,720% after the coin's quotes cooled slightly. As reported by CryptEye, such a result was reached due to the burning of 44 million SHIBs in a single day, which constitutes 41.9% of all tokens burned in the last week. However, despite the six-digit number of SHIBs sent to ""dead"" addresses and the three-digit burn rate, their equivalent value is less than $525. Meanwhile, since the start of autumn, the amount of SHIBs burned globally has plateaued. As reported by U.Today,  Shiba Inu token  burning has fallen by 60.6% since September. According to the one-year graph, this trend is ongoing and represents a normal state of affairs.",https://u.today/david-gokhshtein-to-go-out-and-buy-shib-cardano-founder-speaks-on-musk-doge-and-twitter-whales-move,utoday,2022-11-01,13:47:00,en

Happy Halloween🎃🦇 #Cardano   #Blockchain 🚀  pic.twitter.com/SiBkG0iCXT According to the graphic posted, the number of transactions reached 53.3 million, up 4.18% from August. At the same time, the overall number of wallets grew by 1.06% to 3.63 million, while the number of delegated wallets increased marginally by 0.35% at 1.22 million. Thus, at the moment, out of 3.63 million ADA wallets, 1.22 million are involved in staking, which is quite encouraging. Twenty-seven percent of transaction types were made with smart contracts, representing a 2% increase for October. Seventh-three percent of transaction types were made without smart contracts. October would be the first month of the new era ushered in by the Vasil hard fork; therefore, the network seems to be gradually fitting into the scheme of things. In its weekly development updates, IOHK shared statistics regarding network growth on a chart. Currently, 1,127 projects are building on Cardano. A total of 103 projects have launched on Cardano, while Cardano native tokens stood at 6.5 million across 63,865 policies. Also, the number of Plutus scripts was 3,531.

cardano,No Section,Here Are Most Profitable Cryptocurrencies of Last Month Apart from DOGE,"Although October was predicted to be a more successful month for the crypto market than September, which even led to it being called Uptober, with each new day it seemed that these hopes were in vain. However, the crypto market's total capitalization did grow for the month, by $70 billion, or 7.32% in relative terms. Let's take a look at who  accounted  for most of this growth. Clearly the most profitable token of the month was  Dogecoin (DOGE) . The return of DOGE's godfather, Elon Musk, to a deal to buy Twitter set the cryptocurrency's quotes on fire and took it 135% above the month's opening price. In second place with a 98.3% monthly growth rate was HT, the native token of the  Huobi  exchange. Not without the help of renowned crypto enthusiast Justin Sun, who became the exchange's chief advisor, HT was one of the sensations of the month. Third place went to  Osmosis (OSMO) , which rocketed on news of its listing on Binance. One of the leading projects in the Cosmos ecosystem ended October at 44%, with the jump in price occurring just in the last three days of the month. Fourth and fifth place can be roughly divided between TWT and  CSRP , which both managed to rise in value by 37% at the end of October. Like OSMO, both cryptocurrencies are less than $500 million in capitalization, indicating a rather low liquidity that lends itself to easy pumping. The triggers that put these cryptocurrencies at the top of the month in terms of profitability are unknown; the general crypto public will probably find out later.",https://u.today/here-are-most-profitable-cryptocurrencies-of-last-month-apart-from-doge,utoday,2022-11-01,14:11:00,en

In fact, for the first time since 2020, the world’s largest cryptocurrency is now less volatile than the S&P 500 stock market index. The fact that trading volumes remain consistently high sets this bearish cycle apart from the crypto winter of 2018.  In late October, Arcane Research analyst Vetle Lunde suggested that the cryptocurrency market was likely to see “explosive” volatility due to growing futures open interest.  Bitcoin managed to finish the previous month  in the green  after two red monthly candles in a row.

cardano, Interview , ‘Great cryptocurrencies have to go through several collapses’ — Cardano founder ,"Charles Hoskinson, the founder of Cardano and one of the co-founders of Ethereum, said one of the biggest lessons crypto users could take away from the collapse of Terra and other projects was learning to appreciate those that withstood the test of time. Speaking to Cointelegraph at the Web Summit tech conference in Portugal on Nov. 2, Hoskinson said he had seen many  companies in the crypto space collapse , from Silk Road to Mt. Gox. According to Hoskinson, protocols that survived were “resilient under an adversarial load,” capable of weathering both bear and bull markets — something of which many  decentralized finance (DeFi)  projects were incapable. “Just ‘cause you’re on top today, you’re not always going to be,” said Hoskinson. “Great cryptocurrencies have to go through several collapses. I was in Bitcoin when it was under a dollar, and I watched it go from a dollar to $30, to $40, to $256, to $80, to $1,200, to $250, to $20,000, to $4,000, to $64,000, now down to, what is that, $20,000 today, give or take? I watched that, and I watched all the companies come and go.” Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson speaking to Cointelegraph social media specialist Mada at Web Summit on Nov. 2 Hoskinson said some DeFi projects had a limited “shelf life of maybe 6-12 months” and were “biased towards insider distribution,” as many in the space learned after the collapse of Terra: “The way things were constructed, [Terra] was wildly profitable for a few people, and those few people happened to be well connected to the space, and so they lifted it up, and they made billions of dollars, and they made it off the back of retail investors — which is wrong. It’s going to result in a regulatory crackdown in that particular area.” Related:  Charles Hoskinson and Ethereum dev get into a war of words post-Vasil upgrade The Cardano founder has frequently  criticized the Ethereum protocol  following his departure from the project, as well as the proof-of-work system connected to Bitcoin ( BTC ) mining.

cardano,No Section,"Major Cryptocurrency Companies Have to Fire Most of Their Staff, What's Happening?","The digital assets industry got hit with a series of huge layoffs at major crypto-related companies like BitMex, Galaxy Digital and DCG. Each company plans on decreasing its current number of workers by 20-30% on average. The main reason is the problematic conditions on the  market .  Despite the most recent but yet mild recovery of the cryptocurrency market, most blockchain-related companies are trying to cut existing costs since almost every entity that somehow worked or held cryptocurrencies could not meet the expectations of investors and experts. In the last 12 hours of news, three large cryptocurrency companies have laid off their staff: Galaxy Digital plans to lay off 20% of its staff; BitMEX plans to lay off 30% of its staff, and DCG has laid off 10% of its staff. For example, Michael Saylor's MicroStrategy reported a 2.1% revenue decrease since 2021, with $125.4 million. Analysts' expectations were at $127.25 million. The drop in revenue also includes losses from the company's cryptocurrency holdings that did not show any positivity in 2022. While most companies are trying to hide the fact that they have to cut their expenses by firing most of their staff, the trading volume and market netflows show that the industry is going through a severe crisis and the recovery will not be possible without the prolonged  uptrend  fueled by fresh institutional inflows that would cause a revenue increase. Companies cutting their current staff is not something unusual for a bear market. We saw the same tendency back in 2018 and 2019, which is why investors should not consider it a signal about the future of the crypto market, as it is more of a consequence than a cause.

In a new longread, representatives of the Cardanians staking pool explained that ""pre-mined"" ADA coins should be neither interpreted as a centralization instrument nor as a threat to Cardano's (ADA) sustainability. Is  #Cardano  a scam just because of pre-mined  $ADA  coins? No, because the IOG team distributed the coins in a fair way and the  #PoS  network could not have been launched any other and better way.  https://t.co/RjWyM6SDZ8 According to this text, even Bitcoin (BTC), which was introduced 14 years ago, was not decentralized from the very beginning. The first mining rewards were controlled by a small group of enthusiasts. At the same time, it was necessary to launch a new blockchain and keep it secure. Even nowadays, a monstrous amount of Bitcoins (BTC) is still stored in a so-called ""Satoshi wallet."" Over 1.12 million Bitcoins (BTC) are stored on this wallet; however, this does not expose the Bitcoin (BTC) network or its mining ecosystem to a centralization threat. Not unlike with early Bitcoiners, initially, the ADA supply was controlled by three entities — IOHK (now IOG), Emurgo and the Cardano Foundation. Meanwhile, when Cardano (ADA) migrated to a proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, such centralized distribution stopped affecting the current status of Cardano (ADA) decentralization. As covered by U.Today previously, Cardano (ADA) remains among the most popular proof-of-stake (PoS) ecosystems.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Faces Its Final Test After Reaching Fundamental Resistance Level,"Following a 16-day rally on the  market , Cardano has faced the most serious resistance level on the chart that might become a reversal point for Ethereum's rival, especially with the lack of support. Despite breaking the 50-day moving average that has been acting like a guideline for Cardano for a long period of time, the asset has faced yet another resistance: the trendline that was formed back in September. At press time, the resistance stays at $0.43, while ADA trades at $0.43. Despite the one day volume spike on Nov. 5, traders are slowly dropping support for the cryptocurrency as the volume profile indicator shows a descending tendency that will most likely lead to a reversal from the current price  level . In comparison to other digital assets, Cardano has not entered a consolidation channel that would later on become a foundation for a recovery. Instead, bears have been continuously pushing ADA down, and even a 24% price increase we saw recently is nothing compared to the losses Cardano investors had to witness since September 2021. Unfortunately, all the success ADA has had in the development field is not being translated to the market. Cardano remains one of the least profitable assets on the cryptocurrency market. According to data relevant in October,  ADA's  profitability plunged below the critical 15% mark, pushing the majority of crypto investors, who usually aim for short-term profit, even further.

ADA whale predicts that while most cryptocurrencies will compete with these tech giants, Cardano will raise the bar by being fully P2P decentralized and self-governed. They're going to get their heads stuck so deep up Big Tech's behind that they will become indistinguishable from it. Again, I've been predicting and explaining that this would happen since the moment I started tweeting. Now sit back and watch it all play out He wrote, ""Tech giants will enter crypto. AppleCoin will have amazing smart contracts and offer regulated financial products. Most of crypto will be competing with them. By then, Cardano will be fully P2P decentralized and self-governed. Out of anyone's grasp and a different beast altogether."" At the heart of the Cardano network are 3,229 stake pools run by operators (SPOs), who oversee the distributed nodes that keep the network operational. This is because the decentralization of Cardano puts the responsibility for running the blockchain in the hands of stake pools. Likewise, reliable and efficient connections between all the distributed nodes and making sure the network is resilient to failure are key components of this decentralization drive. With the launch of the peer-to-peer (P2P) testnet in December 2021, Cardano began a significant project to help its continued push toward complete decentralization. P2P communication aims to enhance information transfer between nodes. After the Vasil hard fork event that occurred on Sept. 22, P2P networking, or decentralization of the networking layer, is the most anticipated upgrade. Once all P2P nodes are operational, the Cardano network will be entirely decentralized, eliminating the need for centralized services that the network currently utilizes. Recent reports suggest that the P2P development is feature complete and that all necessary testing has been completed. The design and implementation are being reviewed because the rollout of P2P nodes will take place gradually.",https://u.today/cardano-will-raise-bar-community-predicts-entrant-of-tech-giants-into-crypto,utoday,2022-11-06,14:16:00,en

However, the community behind the meme doesn’t seem to be very appreciative of the idea.  After Hoskinson’s post got removed from the subreddit, Markus recalled how the Cardano founder slammed Dogecoin as a bubble in April 2021 when the Bitcoin parody was in the middle of a blistering rally. The Musk  sycophant added that Doge wouldn’t use Cardano “for anything.”  Hoskinson defended his criticism of the meme cryptocurrency, arguing that the ownership of the cryptocurrency is skewed to just a few wallets. He also went on to accuse Dogecoin of a lack of decentralization after Markus categorically rejected the idea of using the Cardano blockchain.  Hoskinson argues that his recent video was an olive branch. At the same time, he is convinced that the meme coin needs “innovation” and “utility” since it will collapse without another billionaire patron.    As reported by U.Today, Hoskinson recently  said  that he wasn’t going to retire despite facing severe criticism within the cryptocurrency community.   In the meantime, the price of Dogecoin  keeps plunging  as Musk’s Twitter is shaping up to be a disaster.  ",https://u.today/cardanos-charles-hoskinson-trades-barbs-with-dogecoin-cofounder,utoday,2022-11-07,06:28:00,en

The last such anomaly was in mid-August, when the price of DOGE rose 20% in three days and then the crypto market lost 12% in capitalization, or $140 billion, in the following three days. This time, the talk is about a 95% surge in the price of  DOGE  in the last week of October, spurred by the purchase of Twitter by Elon Musk, the chief ambassador of the main meme coin.

Interestingly, each of the collapses is not directly related to DOGE itself; the sharp rise in its price each time is just a sign. The current fall in the crypto market, for example, is primarily attributed to the situation around the FTX exchange, its affiliate Alameda Research and the exchange's native token, FTT. As reported by U.Today,  FTX  is under enormous pressure due to suspected insolvency and the news of its competitor, Binance's, sale of 23 million FTTs worth nearly $600 million.

We analyzed the stablecoins hold by  #Kucoin  and found that in the past 7 days, there were not too many stablecoins flowing out from  #Kucoin .

A short thread.🧵 As it turned out, the main reason for users' concern was a drop in the number of stablecoins held by the exchange by $240 million in the last seven days. With the total balance of stablecoins held by KuCoin equivalent to $1.1 billion, it was a question of 20% and more. However, KuCoin did not withdraw funds but simply switched networks, exchanging 300 million USDT from Ethereum to TRC through the Bitfinex exchange. Moreover, over the past seven days, the exchange has not experienced an outflow of stablecoins at all and even registered a net inflow of $63 million. Events like the sudden ""disappearance"" of $240 million from KuCoin's holdings seem especially unnerving after what happened to  FTX . Recall that as a result of the publicized facts about the possible insolvency of one of the leading cryptocurrency exchanges and affiliated structures, a massive outflow of funds followed. According to FTX head Sam Bankman-Fried, the outflow was so massive that by midday, the exchange needed about $6 billion to plug the hole.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Avoids FTX Tragedy Thanks to This,"Almost no top altcoin was able to avoid yesterday's events surrounding the collapse of major crypto exchange FTX, but some managed to get away with just a few scratches. ADA, Cardano's native blockchain token, lost less than 10% in value and was the least affected cryptocurrency of the top 10 by market capitalization. The reason ADA probably got away with little bloodshed during the crypto market bloodbath was the fact that the token was not listed on the spot market on  FTX  in time. As recently as a week ago, FTX CEO Sam Bankman-Fried claimed that ADA would soon appear on the exchange, explaining its absence by the fact that Cardano is a ""new"" blockchain. At the time, renowned crypto blogger Ben ""BitBoy"" Armstrong and  Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson were also discussing whether ADA's listing on FTX would turn tragic in the context of a sell-off of blocked funds on Voyager, the crypto broker bought by the exchange. The collapse of FTX turned into a double win for Cardano. First, it benefited alternatively from not being listed on the FTX spot market.

cardano,Opinion,How to Level the Global Financial System,"Nearly two years after one of the biggest short squeezes in market history, some lessons have been learned and others less so, possibly because investors are struggling to keep up with what has become a relentless and punishing stream of macro and market news. The GameStop saga of 2021 has now been cataloged in two separate documentaries – aptly named “Eat the Rich” and “Diamond Hands” – which make for compelling TV. The story illustrates the cumulative risks of powerful market players acting as gatekeepers while having little interest in protecting both individual and public interests. Frederik Gregaard is the CEO of the Cardano Foundation. The cycle of euphoria and crash that Gamestop epitomized has since played out, to even more devastating effect in the crypto arena. Hundreds of thousands of retail investors were left holding drastically devalued tokens thanks to the mismanagement of high profile investment funds and brokerages. In addition, crypto evangelists with vested interests in the inflated price of these assets and who zealously overhyped them must assume their share of the blame. My own journey into blockchain started out of frustration. Why weren’t the benefits available to “accredited investors” also available to ordinary citizens? In answering this question, I saw an amazing opportunity to democratize finance through decentralization, empowering individuals to do more with their economic assets and to improve society as they did so. While I firmly believe in the potential of blockchain, as long as we use the same breath to talk about crypto and meme stocks we are falling far short of that potential. The true financial potential of blockchain is not as a new set of speculative assets, but as a vehicle for radical transparency, giving power to identity and new forms of governance. Not to mention the efficiency of the technology itself, which can reduce market distortions and volatility, even as it lowers costs and speeds up transaction times. See also:  Blockchain Means So Much More Than Crypto  | Opinion In short, the blockchain mission should not be about promoting specific tokens or taking down Wall Street but about leveling up our entire global financial system. As we watch liquidity drain from financial reserves at frightening speed, it is critical that we refocus on this mission. We must set our sights on transforming, rather than merely trashing, the titans of Wall Street. At the Cardano Foundation, we are committed to two difficult things: genuine engagement on the complex problem of how to educate, engage and drive adoption of blockchain technology among traditional enterprises; and active commitment to the principles of decentralization and community best exemplified by the open source software movement. I believe that addressing any of these two tasks properly helps to solve the other, and that we should prioritize both simultaneously. Just as the transparency embedded in open source software means it is now trusted by blue chip companies to run their most crucial platforms, the openness and legibility of blockchain done right can help to make financial empowerment and disintermediation more than just meme stock buzzwords. Third-generation blockchain protocols are more sophisticated and more resilient than the creaking technology on which much of our financial system still runs. But no matter how good our tech and how committed our community is, replacing the legacy technology of incumbent banks becomes an even more daunting task than trying to take down hedge funds over-exposed to a single stock. It demands not only revolutionary spirit but also regulatory awareness. Read more:  The Crypto Revolution's 'Turning Point'  | Opinion The innovation and transformation that our technologies can bring is continuing at tremendous speed, and policymakers have taken notice. In Europe, the Markets in Crypto Assets Regulation (MiCA) will soon go into effect, creating a legal framework for the functioning of crypto-assets markets. Across the Atlantic Ocean, in the U.S., the Biden administration is working to develop laws that spur growth and inhibit fraud. This increased regulatory activity signals that blockchain technologies are here for the long haul. Right now, lawmakers need to ensure they future-proof their legislation so that, instead of just responding to possible threats, they can throw open the door for honest and beneficial innovation.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Is in Enormous 9% Recovery, Here's Why: Crypto Market Review, November 11","As the dust from the  FTX  drama begins to settle, the price performance of most assets normalized, and some cryptocurrencies are currently in the process of a reversal. Cardano and Ethereum are among the best performers in the last 24 hours. In the last 24 hours, Cardano is showing a strong 9% reversal following the stabilization of the cryptocurrency market after the panic among investors turned into regular fear. Additionally, Cardano avoided the panic sale and has ""only"" tanked by 14%, which should not be considered too much compared to assets like Solana. However, the most interesting part of the correction on  ADA  is the Relative Strength Index divergence that hints at the upcoming reversal rally and momentum increase. The signal is usually considered one of the strongest signs of an upcoming reversal from a technical standpoint. In one of his most recent tweets, Charles Hoskinson supported the drastic difference between Cardano and assets like FTT and why it will always be financially stable, without causing a devastating situation like that the community has absorbed in the last two days. As we mentioned in our previous market review, the FTX catastrophe might be far from a logical conclusion, and the most recent SOL staking unlock is a confirmation of this thesis. However, assets like Cardano should avoid any critical spikes in selling pressure or panic among investors. At the beginning of November, Ethereum's price performance was unusually depressed, with the price of the second biggest cryptocurrency on the market reaching new lows for almost no reason, while the other part of the market has been successfully moving up or consolidating. The existing selling pressure pushed the Relative Strength Index to a four-month low after the price of Ether faced a strong decline and reached the $1,100 threshold amid the FTT catastrophe. Right now, Ether is going through a mild recovery, with a 7.6% price increase in the last 24 hours. Regardless of the fact that almost every major asset on the market is going through a recovery on Nov. 10, Tron is not one of them, and the reason is Justin Sun's desire to help FTX users who are now able to ""leave"" the exchange by buying  TRX . Such an unexpected offering caused a price surge of TRX on FTX. The token's price gained an enormous premium against the same trading pair on Binance, causing issues for market makers who operate on numerous exchanges. To balance the situation out, market makers started selling TRX on available trading platforms, causing a negative price performance for the asset. Additionally, Tron-backed stablecoin coin USDD has a problem with maintaining the $1 peg and currently trades around $0.98. Technically, the stablecoin should not have any problem with recovering the $1 price and will most likely do so after Tron deploys more capital to maintain the stability of USDD.",https://u.today/cardano-is-in-enormous-9-recovery-heres-why-crypto-market-review-november-11,utoday,2022-11-10,23:50:00,en

U.S. CPI recorded 7.7% in October, falling below 8% again after seven months, the smallest increase since January 2022. It was below expectations of 8% and the previous month's 8.2%.

Consumer prices increased by 7.7% during the year through October, less than the 7.9% economists had expected and down from the 8.2% during the year through September. Between September and October, monthly price increases rose by 0.4%, matching the prior month. The ""core"" inflation index slowed from 6.6% in the previous reading to 6.3% annually. Fed Chair Jerome Powell also hinted at a modest rate hike by the central bank in 2011. The crypto market had previously tumbled in the early part of the week on the news of the FTX blow-up.

In particular, Bitcoin and Ethereum dropped well below the $18,000 and $1,500 levels, and BTC even plunged to the $16,500 zone briefly. The collapse of crypto prices was caused by the  FTX crypto giant  and its founder Sam Bankman-Fried going bankrupt and ending up with a huge liquidity gap of over $8 billion that Sam is now trying to raise from investors. Answering a question from CNBC's Squawk Box co-host Andrew Sorkin, Scaramucci shared that he believes the problems of FTX and Bankman-Fried started in the summer, around June, and back then Scaramucci started wondering where all the money was pouring into FTC and Alameda Reseach from.

This happened after Bankman-Fried acquired a 30% stock in Scaramucci's financial services business. Scaramucci said that on Tuesday of this week, he and his legal and compliance team began discussing whether they could help the FTX chief rescue the situation. They came to the conclusion that it was much more than just a ""rescue situation"" for FTX and its connection with Alameda Research. Scaramucci added that he does not want to go as far as to call FTX's insolvency fraud because that is a legal term. We do not know all the details of what happened, he said, and he would prefer to leave it to regulators to decide that. However, Scaramucci believes the impact of this event is bad for the crypto industry. He reckons that Bankman-Fried and his parents should have an honest talk with the investors of FTX and tell them the truth about what happened.

Having lost about 22% in price from Nov. 8 to 9, ADA nevertheless beat BTC by 5% and ETH by 11%, and at one point even by 18%. Cardano's direct competitor, Solana, does not seem worth mentioning, for now at least, given that it has become a scapegoat and lost more than half of its value because of its association with  Alameda and FTX . By now, ADA has recovered 18%. As reported by U.Today, the fact that  Cardano  was little affected by the collapse of FTX could probably explain the absence of ADA on the infamous exchange's spot market.",https://u.today/cardano-network-activity-spikes-on-ftx-crash-heres-detailed-insight,utoday,2022-11-11,11:45:00,en

In January 2021, the Ergo Platform team collaborated with Cardano via a partnership with EMURGO to explore solutions that will advance both platforms and DeFi. According to Ergo, the introduction of the Babel fees would create new opportunities, such as Initial Miner Offerings and marketplaces, as it would encourage adoption. In February 2021, Cardano builder IOG introduced the Babel fee mechanism. Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson described it as ""one of the biggest advances in the entire industry,"" as the ""Babel fees"" mechanism would enable the payment of transaction fees in native tokens on the Cardano blockchain. This would help improve the functionality of the protocol and spur the creation of new ecosystems on Cardano. The ""Babel fees"" are made possible by the Cardano Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model. Unlike Ethereum's account-based model, issuing a valid transaction on Cardano necessitates consuming one or more UTXOs. However, a UTXO on Cardano can support a bundle that contains a variety of tokens, both fungible and non-fungible. Prof. Aggelos Kiayias of IOG explained this in a blog post, saying the Extended UTXO (EUTXO) model ""may carry not just ADA but a token bundle that can contain multiple different tokens, both fungible and non-fungible."" Details on the implementation of the Babel fees mechanism on Cardano remain scanty, save for a Twitter post by  IOHK  in August this year explaining the mechanism.",https://u.today/cardanos-groundbreaking-fee-mechanism-adopted-by-this-l1-blockchain-details,utoday,2022-11-12,14:41:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano's ""Best Days Are Ahead,"" Community Predicts","In a week described as the worst in the history of the crypto space, Bitcoin and other  digital currencies  went down heavily. ADA was not excluded from the bearish action, though it posted lesser losses in comparison to other major cryptocurrencies. The bane of the crypto market crash was the FTX implosion. Bahamas-based FTX filed for bankruptcy on Friday after a rush of customer withdrawals earlier this week. A rescue deal with Binance fell through, precipitating crypto's highest-profile collapse in recent years. The market suffered a serious blow as a result of FTX's demise and the uncertainty it has caused in the sector. Given that prices are still under pressure and susceptible to more severe losses, analysts believe the extent of the damage will depend on what additional information surfaces in the upcoming days. The TLDR of this is that while the outcome may seem the same in the short term as everything gets sucked up in the vortex, and there may be superficial similarities (blockchain, crypto) we are RADICALLY different. And that will show long term. The best days are ahead of Cardano Cardano-focused Twitter account  ADA whale  is not too happy with ADA's price underperformance so far in 2022. He says while the short-term outcome might be the same as long as the market remains under pressure, the long-term is what matters.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Demonstrates Strong Price Action, Here's What Happened","ADA, Cardano's native blockchain token, is showing interesting pricing behavior, having returned to $0.33 for the second time this fall. Having last touched that price at the end of October, ADA went on to show an increase of more than 30% in price. Whether  Cardano  will be able to demonstrate a similar result again will become a little clearer in the coming days, should the price be able to stay above that zone. However, it is important to note that despite all the turmoil of the crypto market in the last bearish year, ADA has not fallen below $0.33. In fact, that level, which was first set in early 2021, was the starting point from which Cardano went to its all-time high in August of the same year. Since then, ADA has lost around 90%, which is usually considered a sufficient correction on the crypto market. In terms of technical analysis, if the decline is destined to continue, the next level after $0.33 is around $0.16, which would mean  ADA's price  would drop another half. From a fundamental analysis perspective, i.e., focusing directly on operational performance and the narrative around the blockchain, Cardano is doing well. Thus, due to the absence of ADA on the spot market of the infamous  FTX  crypto exchange, Cardano probably avoided a major tragedy, which would have no doubt sent token prices into free fall. Moreover, as reported by U.Today,  Cardano  experienced a surge in network activity during the turbulence.

Frightened users are rushing to withdraw funds from centralized exchanges and transfer them to various wallets and DEXes. Speaking of the  Cardano  ecosystem, there are two DeFi projects whose  user base  has grown by 20% or more in the past 30 days. The first such project is Minswap. According to  DappRadar , the number of unique active wallets (UAW) interacting with the platform grew by 22% to 16,791. Volume on Minswap grew at a similar rate, amounting to 101.67 million ADA, or $78.5 million. At the same time, the number of transactions passing through the decentralized exchange increased even more, by 30.3%. Thus, the above-mentioned volume turnover on Minswap is about 415,000 transactions. Another Cardano-based project experiencing a DeFi renaissance is SundaeSwap.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Founder on XRP and Ethereum, and Why Conspiracy Theories Are Crazy","Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson has once again  spoken out  against conspiracy theories regarding Ethereum and the litigation between the SEC and Ripple. The occasion was a tweet by pro-XRP lawyer John Deaton, who used the example of FTX to point out what he believes to be a conspiracy. So,  Hoskinson  said that communicating with regulators, and the SEC in particular, is important, but such allegations of corruption as in the case between the  XRP  community and Ethereum is insanity that spoils any positive development in this direction. According to Cardano's founder, who was directly involved in the development of Ethereum, the fact that the commission and its former head, William Hinman, gave the green light to ETH has nothing to do with the case against Ripple. Hoskinson essentially asked Deaton, if Ethereum Foundation representatives bribed officials for immunity from security status, then by Ripple supporters' logic, would that mean that ETH and XRP are in fact securities? Ripple's current CTO, David Schwartz, then joined the conversation. In his view, believing that the decision on Ethereum's status had no impact, after the way things have turned out, is wrong. As Ethereum founder  Vitalik Buterin  once argued, XRP simply lacked protection. But to adopt the position that XRP is a security and ETH isn't is a very different thing because it requires a level of precision that the other two positions don't require. To adopt that as a rational position, you have to think particular things matter in particular ways. 2/2 As a reminder, recordings of the former SEC head's speeches regarding Ethereum's status were recently obtained by  Ripple  but cannot yet be made public.

cardano,No Section,"XRP's ""Diamond Resistance"" Plays Out Again: Crypto Market Review, November 14","The dynamic on the  cryptocurrency market  is slowly recovering as the majority of assets are returning to normal, institutional investors are counting their losses and fear no longer drives sentiment. At some point, XRP's behavior on the market seemed worrisome, considering the failed reversal attempt on Nov. 11 and the continuation of the downtrend on the weekend. However, after reaching the strong support level for the second time, bulls have pushed the coin's value upward, avoiding a further crash. The aforementioned resistance is located at the lower border of the trading range  XRP  entered back in July. Previously, the coin successfully bounced off of it at least four times, making the threshold one of the most resilient supports on the chart in general. The drop to the aforementioned support level was followed by the plunge of the Relative Strength Index to the oversold range, increasing the bounce possibility. As for now, the indicator stays in the neutral zone, which makes a move in either direction possible. In case of neutral market performance, XRP and other altcoins should return to pre-FTX crash price ranges. Unfortunately, Bitcoin's movements today may become a reason behind XRP's loss of traction on the market. While XRP successfully bounces from the aforementioned support level,  Cardano  is having trouble finding enough support from investors to enter a noteworthy recovery rally and currently shows an insignificant 1.3% recovery in contrast to XRP's 9%. The most likely reason behind the lack of strength on ADA is the poor state of the asset on the market in general: Cardano is notorious for one of the lowest profitability rates across the top 100 on the market and relatively low volatility in rangebounds. All of the aforementioned factors are pushing investors away from Cardano and causing a deficit of inflows into the asset, which makes a full-size bounce impossible for ADA in the current market's conditions. Thankfully, the cryptocurrency market is seeing a gradual recovery, according to the total market capitalization metric. In the last three days, more than $40 billion have returned to the industry, which is why it is safe to say that investors are gaining back some positivity, and the complete recovery of the industry to the state it was in prior to the FTX crash is possible. Amid the crisis, the positive CPI inflation data pushed high risk markets upward, while  Bitcoin  was struggling to get through the selling pressure of FTX and its investors. After the dust settles, we might see an unexpected yet positive BTC that will be a lagging reflection of the CPI effect. At press time, Bitcoin has once again faced a sudden wave of the selling pressure on the market and is currently battling to remain in the $17,000 price range, which is a necessary foothold for the continuation of the rally above the $20,000 price level.",https://u.today/xrps-diamond-resistance-plays-out-again-crypto-market-review-november-14,utoday,2022-11-14,23:50:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Believes This Could Have Saved Ripple from SEC's Lawsuit,"Co-founder of Ethereum and creator of IOG and Cardano Charles Hoskinson has gotten himself engaged in a large-scale debate with Ripple's chief technology officer on Twitter. In the course of this debate, Hoskinson shared with David Schwartz and John Deaton why the  SEC took Ripple  and XRP to court but declared Ethereum and Bitcoin to be nonsecurities before that. The conversation started between founder of CryptoLaw John Deaton and Charles Hoskinson regarding the SEC's case against Ripple. Deaton was sharing his thoughts on crypto regulation that has been implemented in other parts of the world, in countries such as Japan and Switzerland but not the U.S. He then shared his suspicions about Gary Gensler meeting with  Sam Bankman-Fried  of the bankrupt FTX exchange. Deaton was curious why it was SBF whom the SEC chairman chose to meet and not Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong or Jesse Powell of Kraken — both are U.S.-based platforms. Gensler and SBF's Zoom meeting took place in late March, more than half a year before the collapse and bankruptcy of FTX, according to a  Fox Business  article. Anonymous sources close to the matter told Fox Business that Gensler and the former billionaire SBF were discussing the possibility of creating a crypto trading platform fully approved by the SEC. This, if true, was taking place while the securities regulator was going at the crypto space heavily by continuing its long-running lawsuit against Ripple Labs and threatening to sue Coinbase for its plans to roll out a crypto lending service earlier this year. Charles Hoskinson stepped into the tweet thread when Deaton stated that Hoskinson should have spoken to Gensler before SBF. The Cardano founder responded that he did speak in front of Congress in 2022 already and has ""engaged with regulators extensively"" overall. He then denied the idea that Ethereum co-founder Joe Lubin bribed the SEC to start attacking Ripple. Hoskinson believes that Ethereum, which along with Bitcoin has been marked as a nonsecurity asset by the SEC, has ""zero material impact on the ripple litigation."" He believes that Ethereum got a ""regulatory free pass"" because by the time the SEC started looking into the matter, a large ecosystem of dApps was already built on ETH and lots of billionaires with political capital were invested in it, as well as many VCs. Besides, Ethereum then ran on proof of work, similarly to Bitcoin. They adopted the position because by the time they could intervene, ethereum had a huge ecosystem of dapps, many VCs, tons of billionaires with political capital, and ran proof of work, which bitcoin got a pass on Charles Hoskinson believes that if Ripple had created its own dApp ecosystem, the SEC perhaps would not have attacked it. This is what he told Deaton and Ripple CTO David Schwartz: Had you guys followed codius through to its logical conclusion and built a dapp ecosystem, xrp would have gotten a pass. This wasn't bribery. It's reality. Regulators pick the path of least resistance.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-believes-this-could-have-saved-ripple-from-secs-lawsuit,utoday,2022-11-15,11:09:00,en

According to Cardano Explorer, 11% of stake pool operators are now running on this latest node version. cardano-node 1.35.4:  https://t.co/o4Shr2Yilo 
 
Cardano Node 1.35.4 
Released by disassembler - input-output-hk #Cardano   $ADA According to GitHub release notes, Node 1.35.4 supports the use of SECP256K1 elliptic curves that would allow cross-chain development on Cardano. It also included some CLI improvements, which included changing the default ledger era to Babbage for transaction commands. SECP, or SECP 256k1 in particular,  refers  to a widely utilized elliptic curve. Many blockchains (including Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance Coin) use this curve to implement public key cryptography, which uses a key pair (public and private keys) to validate transaction signatures. This would enable secure, cross-chain dApp development on Cardano. Cardano uses the Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA) with elliptic curve25519 as its native signature algorithm.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder on FTX: It Might Be Good Idea to Donate Some Money to Certain Politicians,"Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) continues to make  news  on the cryptocurrency market. Recently, the face behind collapsed exchange FTX gave an interview to The New York Times (NYT) in which he appeared calm and said that the collapse of his companies is not keeping him from sleeping. “You would’ve thought that I’d be getting no sleep right now, and instead I’m getting some. It could be worse,”  said SBF . However, what really caught the attention of the blockchain milieu was the direction the NYT article took. The Twitter profile of Trung Phan, for example, pointed out that words associated with the FTX case, like “fraud,” “crime,” “illiquidity” and “back door, were not mentioned in the publication, as they were in other media sources. ""In NYT article, Alameda CEO admits to misappropriating FTX customer deposits. Per FTX Terms of Service, the deposits are not FTX’s to use…and FTX can’t loan it. NYT writes it up FTX “used” and “lent” deposits. Think the appropriate words are: “wire fraud,” “stole,” “theft”"". Sharing the mentioned tweet,  Cardano  creator Charles Hoskinson  said :  "" Guys it might be a good idea to donate some money to certain politicians. It seems that you can get away with anything and have zero media accountability."" Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was also outraged by the NYT content. ""Twitter has broken just about every piece of this FTX story using blockchain analytics, while NYT is writing puff pieces on a criminal. Feels like a turning point for citizen journalism and loss of trust in MSM."" The outrage ensued as the fall of SBF’s empire brought a meltdown to the cryptocurrency market. Not only has the price of Bitcoin (BTC) and altcoins been affected, but companies have started to declare insolvency. An example of this is BlockFi, a crypto credit platform that can file for judicial recovery. Last Thursday, BlockFi paused customer withdrawals, and earlier this week, the company reaffirmed that it would keep withdrawals paused and limit activity. This all came about as  BlockFi relies heavily on FTX , as it had a $400 million line of credit on the bankrupt exchange. On Friday, Nov. 11, Sam Bankman-Fried announced his departure as CEO of FTX and was replaced by J. Ray III, who has already worked in restructuring companies after bankruptcy, such as Enron Corporation. Additionally, SBF has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection not only for the cryptocurrency exchange but also for Alameda Research and an additional 130 companies affiliated with FTX.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-on-ftx-it-might-be-good-idea-to-donate-some-money-to-certain-politicians,utoday,2022-11-17,01:00:00,en

cardano,No Section,Ex-Ark Invest Manager Describes How to Act Amid Panicking Market,"The former Ark Invest crypto lead, Chris Burniske, on his official Twitter account, explained how to act during a panicking market, when most investors are hysterical and make reckless decisions that contribute to the  market's  uncontrollable volatility and general performance. The first and most important advice shared by Burniske is to stay as calm and rational as possible. Because of the oversaturation of the industry with rumors and fake news, investors should be as cautious as possible to avoid additional losses caused by irrational trades and investments. At the same time, the former fund manager understands why investors are fearful and says that it is okay to feel scared. 2/ Remain calm, remain rational. Things are rarely as good or bad as they seem. Remember that rumors get out of control in a time like this. I see errors in logic everywhere. 
 
Yes, things are peak fear for crypto right now, it’s okay to feel scared, but we will get through this. Thanks to his own insider sources, Burniske believes that industry will become more stable in the future as more clarity will be provided to market participants next week. Meanwhile, investors should provide more attention to the biggest digital assets on the market that usually represent how well the industry is held together against  panic . While staying mentally strong, investors should also be ready for a potential move downward, which is still possible despite the relative calmness that came back to the market. It is important to note that  FTX  still has an $8 billion debt to their own investors who simply deposited funds to the exchange. Reportedly, the exchange was able to collect around $800 million. Considering the lack of capital, FTX will have to liquidate any liquid and illiquid assets they have to return users' deposits. However, it will most likely create serious pressure on the altcoin market, considering its current illiquid state.",https://u.today/ex-ark-invest-manager-describes-how-to-act-amid-panicking-market,utoday,2022-11-18,08:37:00,en

cardano,Business,Cardano Is Launching New Privacy Blockchain and Token,"Input Output Global (IOG), the firm behind the Cardano blockchain, is releasing a new privacy-focused blockchain called Midnight and a token called dust to accompany the new network. Midnight, which is underpinned by  zero-knowledge proof  technology, is one of many side chains now being deployed around Cardano, and will go beyond previous privacy-coin projects by delivering zero-knowledge proof smart contracts, IOG CEO Charles Hoskinson said during  an event at Edinburgh University  in Scotland on Friday. The system will walk the line between preserving privacy and allowing regulators and auditors a backdoor into the system when permission is granted, he said. “Midnight has evolved privacy-coin technology where everything was anonymous by default, which is what zcash and monero did with Snarks and ring signatures,” Hoskinson said in an interview with CoinDesk, referring to two other privacy coins and their encryption methods. “This is a completely new way of writing and running private smart contracts and private computation. So you can have a private DEX (decentralized exchange) or go mine an anonymous data set or these types of things.” Privacy coins have always been lionized by crypto libertarians, but have been viewed warily by regulators fearful of how the technology might help facilitate financial crime. Yet, privacy is something that every business has a legal requirement to explore these days, Hoskinson said, although he noted that the difficulty of figuring out how to add privacy to blockchains has prevented its adoption. “You need programmability; you can’t just take Zcash and  fork  it, and somehow it’ll work,” Hoskinson said of the protocol. “What was needed was the ability to write this stuff in a normal programming language, not some weird Snark thing, but JavaScript or something like that, something developers can understand and get a guarantee you have privacy.” A paper published two years back by IOG, titled  ""Kachina ,"" which dives into privacy-enhanced smart contracts, is now coming to fruition in the real world, Hoskinson said. This has generated interest within the once-hyped world of enterprise blockchains, he added, explaining that Midnight will be working with Hyperledger, for example, which is a consortium of large firms exploring private and permissioned ledgers for things like supply-chain management. “This is what the enterprise absolutely wants, and we have seen Walmart and some of the largest companies in the world working on privacy with Hyperledger,” Hoskinson said. “At the same time, we can service traditional cryptocurrency needs, especially when you look at DEXs that want to prevent front-running and these types of things.”",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/11/18/cardano-is-launching-new-privacy-blockchain-and-token/,coindesk,2022-11-18,19:28:00,en

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Enters Voltaire Age, Here Are Possible Governance Reforms","As the Cardano network moves into its next era, Cardano founder  Charles Hoskinson  has taken to Twitter to share the first CIP for the Age of Voltaire, which ushers in decentralized decision-making. Here's the first CIP for the Age of Voltaire, CIP 1694. We worked really hard on this one. Love to hear your thoughts  https://t.co/mZK2acKIcg The CIP, according to the Github release, proposes a system for on-chain governance that will support Cardano's Voltaire phase. The document improves and expands upon the initial Cardano governance model, which was predicated on a certain number of governance keys. In order to implement the planned Voltaire governance system, it intends to take a first step that is both beneficial and practically feasible soon. The idea would be modified and expanded in later proposals to accommodate changing governance demands. The Voltaire Age is a sequel to the current Basho phase, which was about improving underlying network performance. The Shelley era saw the introduction of a delegation and incentive scheme through community-run stake pools, increasing Cardano’s decentralization. Shelley set the stage for a decentralized and functional network, ultimately laying the groundwork for the Voltaire Era. The current Shelley governance design was intended to provide a simple, transitional approach to governance. The new CIP aims to address some shortcomings of that design. The new governance proposal aims to allow active on-chain participation by ADA holders. Additionally, because movements from the Treasury can be hard to track, the CIP aims to increase transparency and layers of control over these moves. Also, hard forks are not differentiated from other protocol parameter changes, although they need to be treated specially by SPOs. Finally, the CIP proposes a Cardano constitution. Even though many community members and the founding entities of Cardano share a largely universal vision, there is no clearly defined document where these guiding principles are recorded. It is appropriate to use the Cardano blockchain to permanently preserve the project's ethos in the form of the Cardano Constitution.",https://u.today/cardano-enters-voltaire-age-here-are-possible-governance-reforms,utoday,2022-11-18,14:44:00,en

Second only to Ethereum, but by more than double,  Cardano  has $8.12 billion in ADA tokens staked. Even more impressive is Cardano's staking ratio, i.e., what percentage of the token's supply is locked in staking. Thus, according to the  Staking Rewards  portal, 71.63% of the circulating ADA offering is staked. Of the top crypto projects, only BNB Chain (BNB) and Internet Computer (ICP) can compete with Cardano. Solana (SOL) is not far behind, with a staking ratio of 69.6%, but its staked market cap is only $4.96 billion. It is likely that Solana would have been higher on this list than Cardano had the  SOL price  not fallen by more than 50% due to the project's affiliation with infamous cryptocurrency exchange FTX. Cardano itself rather benefited from the collapse of FTX. First, ADA was not listed on the exchange, which helped avoid a large sell-off. Second, its main competitor, Solana, washed down the market cap top along with investor confidence in it.

USDA will be the first fully fiat-backed, regulatory-compliant stablecoin in the Cardano network. That could help bolster Cardano’s decentralized-finance ( DeFi ) ecosystem, which had just over $53 million in value locked as of Friday, according to  DeFiLlama data . Bank of America said  in a research report  Thursday that crypto exchanges’ proofs of reserves have too many shortcomings. Following the  collapse of FTX and Alameda Research , crypto trading platforms are rushing to show that clients’ assets are safe, but proof of reserves isn't complete enough to inspire confidence, the bank said.

On Friday, to the joy of its community, Cardano unveiled Midnight: a zero-knowledge data protection-based sidechain, and its upcoming token, Dust. As much as the Cardano community was excited, the Monero team took to Twitter to point out ""flaws"" in the system, one of which concerned a ""backdoor."" A CoinDesk report quoted the Cardano founder as saying, ""The system will walk the line between preserving privacy and allowing regulators and auditors a backdoor into the system when permission is granted."" In response to a user and also Monero's claims, Hoskinson answered, ""Backdoor? We don't have a backdoor."" He further added that the word ""backdoor"" was a misquote. Hoskinson explained what the Midnight project was about: ""It's a confidentiality platform with a rich identity framework built in via Atala prism. View keys are handled at the DApp level, not the protocol. You add involuntary disclosure as a feature for builders to use."" The newly coined term ""backdoor"" became concerning in the wake of the FTX collapse, with founder Sam Bankman-Fried allegedly having a secret ""back door"" to transfer billions. According to reports, ""bespoke software"" was used to establish a ""back door"" in FTX's books that were unearthed during the financial discovery process. According to its  official website , Midnight will be a data protection-based blockchain that safeguards sensitive commercial and personal data while preserving fundamental freedoms of association, commerce and expression. Additionally, it will make it possible for programmers to create and launch data protection-first dApps fast using a variety of programming languages, starting with TypeScript, and it will let businesses communicate mission-critical information without worrying about leaks or censorship.

The Wall Street Journal  reported  that Genesis was seeking a $1 billion bailout from various investors without any success. Rumor has it that Mike Novogratz and The Winklevii  refused  to rescue the firm.    EZPR CEO Ed Zitron claims that people are “massively underestimating” how bad things could get for the cryptocurrency industry if Genesis Digital capital goes underwater given that this is the largest lender in crypto.  Grayscale, another subsidiary of the DCG empire, recently declined to share proof of reserves due to “security concerns.” Crypto firms are under pressure to publicly share their reserve information following the collapse of the FTX exchange which caught a lot of investors off guard.  Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), the crown jewel of Grayscale, recently reached its all-time low discount of more than 40%.  Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Silbert’s crypto empire  “started showing its cracks.”    Mario Nawfal, the founder of IBC Group,  argues  that Genesis’s potential downfall could be potentially bigger than that of the FTX exchange.  At press time, Bitcoin is trading at the $16,600 level on major spot exchanges.

Liquidity on Cardano (ADA) will be injected into Djed's mechanism step by step to protect the balance of collateralization from volatility spikes. Mr. Bar-Geffen stressed the paramount importance of Cardano's Djed for the ecosystem of the second largest proof-of-stake (PoS) network, its decentralized applications and their users: Djed going to public mainnet is a great achievement, following a lot of hard work from IOG and COTI. Recent market events have proven again that we need a safe haven from volatility, and Djed will serve as this safe haven in the Cardano network. Not only do we need a stablecoin, but we need one that is decentralized, and has on chain proof of reserves. Djed is just that and I see it becoming the top stablecoin on the Cardano network, considering all of the integration partnerships already signed for it. The team also highlighted that it bets on a rigorous approach to stress tests and experiments to avoid any design flaws and imbalances in the DJED/SHEN/ADA design. Immediately after the mainnet release, the stablecoin will be intregrated into 40+ decentralized exchanges, DeFi protocols, on-chain lending/collateralization tools and so on. The stablecoin's inaugural release (v1.1.1 or Minimal Djed) will boast Vasil hard fork compatibility, and the upgrade of the oracle will support six external sources.

cardano,No Section,Bloomberg Analyst Explains Key Difference Between Current Crypto Crisis and Mortgage Meltdown of 2008,"Joe Weisenthal , co-host of Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast, drew parallels between the ongoing cryptocurrency disaster and the mortgage meltdown of 2008. While these crises appear to be similar at first glance, Weisenthal argues that the key difference between them is that people still needed housing. On the other hand, there is no fundamental human need that has to be satisfied by cryptocurrencies. Weisenthal says that speculation on cryptocurrency prices is the only source of revenue for the industry. This is why key ""fundamentals"" also drop sharply during bear markets. The longtime Bloomberg journalist predicts that the crypto industry will experience more spirals in the future since there are no viable use cases for crypto. At the same time, he does not believe that all cryptocurrencies are going to collapse to zero since it is unlikely that the desire to speculate on wild price moves will be expunged entirely. As reported by U.Today, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao predicted that the crypto industry was about to plunge into a crisis similar to the 2008 mortgage meltdown, with the FTX drama potentially affecting other companies.

He believes that Ardana having the collapsed Three Arrows (3AC) as its ""largest ticket"" and a token dump by investors after its financial situation came to light might have been its albatross.  He confirmed to a user that 3AC was an Ardana investor and its single largest ticket. In July, crypto hedge fund Three Arrows (3AC) filed for bankruptcy after it failed to meet margin calls from its lenders. The collapse of Three Arrows triggered a downward spiral that wrapped around many crypto investors. While investors seek to know the way forward in the current mess, the Ardana team stated in a tweet that its remaining funds and treasury balances will be held by Ardana Labs until another competent development team in the community comes forward to continue its work.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-says-he-might-have-lost-500k-in-failed-ardana-project,utoday,2022-11-24,15:39:00,en

The project cited “funding and project timeline uncertainty” as the reason for ceasing operations, in a tweet addressed to the Ardana community Wednesday. Ardana was barely a year into development after raising $10 million last year via a funding round led by now defunct crypto hedge fund, Three Arrows Capital, Cardano’s cFund and Ascensive Assets. The project was working on stablecoin minting and foreign exchange services, and aspired to be “the MakerDAO and the Curve Finance of Cardano.” Per the Ardana Twitter account, “Development on Cardano has been difficult with a lot of funding going into tooling, infrastructure and security. This alongside the uncertainty around development completion has led to the best course of action being halting development of dUSD.” DANA, Ardana's currency, is down 82.54% in the last 24 hours  at the time of publication, currently trading at $0.01046. At its peak in November 2021, it traded at $9.2916, according to cryptocurrency data provider, Coinmarketcap.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Community Raises Red Flags on Two Projects: Details,"According to a recent announcement, Cardano-based projects  Ardana and Orbis  are grinding to a halt. Both projects cited funding constraints and uncertain conditions; more surprising is the coincidence of the two projects' announcements. Ardana and Orbis rugged. According to Cardano-focused Twitter account ADA Whale, there is more than meets the eye regarding the two projects, as he mentioned that ""certain things don't add up."" The  Ardana project  explained the reason behind its action, saying that development on Cardano was difficult, with a lot of funding going into tooling, infrastructure and security. It noted that this, along with uncertainty around the completion of development, led to the halting of dUSD, the stablecoin it worked upon. A user questioned Ardana's claims regarding funding constraints, saying, ""You raised $10 million. How's that money gone in 1-2 years on development? I don't understand."" This was not the first time  Ardana  has put up such worrying concerns. At the start of the year, Ardana claimed it had finished almost all of its product development and could have launched in a few weeks if it wanted. It did, however, make the flimsy excuse that Cardano was not ideal for protocols dealing with liquidations, claiming that it was not safe to launch without putting user funds at risk. This stirred up concerns in the Cardano community, which sought clarifications on what that meant. The Ardana project was slammed for placing the blame for its failures on the Cardano blockchain. Given current happenings, Cardano-based lending protocol AADA Finance has removed DANA token, the native asset of the Ardana project, from its platform. Orbis, another project that said it was halting, stated that investors had pulled out, and it had been badly affected by recent events in the crypto space. It halted its NFT project indefinitely until a continuation plan was set out for the core zk-rollup solution. Sooraj , who previously worked on the Orbis project, raised some concerns about the project, particularly during its token sale.

cardano, News , Leading Cardano stablecoin project shuts down after excruciating launch delays ,"On Nov. 24, Ardana, a leading  decentralized finance (DeFi)  and stablecoin ecosystem building on Cardano, abruptly  halted  development, citing “funding and project timeline uncertainty.” The project will remain open-source for builders while treasury balances and remaining funds will be held by Ardana Labs “until another competent dev team in the community comes forward to continue our work:” “Development on Cardano has been difficult with alot of funding going into tooling, infrastructure and security. This alongside the uncertainty around development completion has led to the best course of action being halting development of dUSD.” The move came as a shock to many due to the sudden nature of the announcement. However, it appears that issues were already present for some time. Beginning July 4, Ardana has held an ongoing initial stake pool offering, or ISPO, to fund its operations. Unlike traditional fundraising mechanisms, developers do not receive Cardano ( ADA ) delegated by users, but instead, the staking rewards. Users are incentivized to keep delegating by receiving the native DANA tokens as a reward. Unfortunately, a simultaneous collapse of the price of DANA and ADA, as well as declining Cardano staking yields from the ongoing crypto winter, has caused issues for ISPO issuers. Over the past year, Ardana’s native DANA tokens have lost close to 99.85% of their value. In January, Ardana  claimed  that “almost all of the product/smart contract development is finished. We could launch our products within a few weeks if we so wanted” and instead blamed the delay on the Cardano network’s “liquidation issues” and “risk to users’ funds.” Most users reacted negatively, placing the blame on Ardana instead. One individual, LucidCiC,  wrote :  “Sounds like you’re blaming Cardano for your own lack of motivation and dedication. You decided to build here for a reason, And now you’re giving up. Others like Axo will come in and take all the glory.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/leading-cardano-stablecoin-project-shuts-down-after-excruciating-launch-delays,cointelegraph,2022-11-24,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano (ADA) Next Big Thing Revealed, Here's Surprising Aspect","Ouroboros Leios  — a new Ouroboros family variant that would significantly increase throughput while achieving optimum security, is thought of by Cardano enthusiasts as the next big thing for the blockchain. Some months ago, I was asked what I thought would be  #Cardano  ""next big thing"". 
 
At the time, we only had a vague idea of what Leios was. The recent CIP from Duncan & al has shed some more light on it. 
 
Ouroboros Leios is definitely the most promising L1 upgrade to come 
 
👇 According to  KtorZ , an open-source developer at the Cardano Foundation, Ouroboros Leios is the most promising L1 upgrade to come. He reveals a surprising aspect of Ouroboros Leios, which is that the idea behind it is relatively simple. In a thread of tweets, KtorZ explains the basis of Ouroboros Leios. Cardano is a distributed system where nodes reach consensus by sharing blocks as per the schedule for which they are elected. Blocks are generated roughly every 20 seconds and are propagated to the rest of the network quickly. He points out that a node is typically not actively validating blocks while it is serializing data and transmitting it to its peers, since the block throughput is typically not high enough to keep the node busy all the time. The idea behind Leios is about utilizing those idle resources and making the chain's construction more parallel. It involves utilizing UTxO's full potential. Input blocks, endorsement blocks and ranking blocks are the three new sorts of blocks Leios proposes dividing the chain construction into. These blocks are created at various rates and serve various purposes. However, it should be borne in mind that Leios remains a Cardano Improvement Proposal (CIP), which might mean it is far away from now. Cardano is heading into the age of Voltaire. As reported by  U.Today , the CIP-1694 has been released, establishing the groundwork for decentralized decision-making. The Voltaire phase of Cardano will be supported by a mechanism for on-chain governance that is described in CIP-1694. The document improves upon and expands upon the initial Cardano governance model, which was predicated on a certain number of governance keys.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-next-big-thing-revealed-heres-surprising-aspect,utoday,2022-11-26,16:47:00,en

Cardano native assets and NFTs bear similarities, technologically speaking, as they are both native assets that can be created using the Cardano node CLI. Narrowing to specific details, in contrast to fungible native assets, which could consist of millions of interchangeable tokens, an NFT is a single native asset that is immutable and exists on the blockchain forever. To be considered an NFT, a native asset must fulfill additional standards. In 2020, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson predicted the development that is now seen on the Cardano blockchain. He predicted ""hundreds of assets, thousands of dApps, tons of interesting projects and lots of unique and utility."" While the prediction on assets has been exceeded, with millions of native tokens on the blockchain, Cardano is yet to match that on dApps. The Alonzo hard fork deployment in September 2021 ushered in smart contract functionality that allowed for the development of dApps.

cardano, News , New Cardano algorithmic stablecoin evokes old fears for the community ,"With the new announcement that Cardano is on its way to release an algorithmic stablecoin in 2023, various community members expressed concerns, comparing the project to TerraUSD (UST), which caused great losses within the crypto space in 2022.  According to its developers, the stablecoin project Djed will be  pegged to the United States dollar  and backed by Cardano ( ADA ). Apart from this, it will be using another token as its reserve coin. The project highlighted that it will be overcollateralized and will have on-chain proof-of-reserves.  Despite the assurances given by the team, various community members expressed concerns, with some  bringing  the recently collapsed UST to the conversation.  One community member was seemingly confused as to why another algorithmic stablecoin has come out despite Terra showing that they could go wrong. “I thought we already figured this out, algorithmic stablecoins, not the best option,” they  wrote . Meanwhile, another Twitter user mentioned that they would rather keep using Tether ( USDT ). According to the community member, algorithmic stablecoins already proved that they are not stable.  In a statement, the Djed team said that though DJED and UST are both algorithmic stablecoins, they aren't the same. The team highlighted that DJED is overcollateralized and will be able to prevent a death spiral by blocking the burning and minting process of coins. They explained that:  “Djed is fully backed and overcollateralized with a significant reserve ratio, up to 8x. The Djed contract has enough money to buy back all the Djed stablecoins in circulation for 1 USD worth of the backing asset, thus maintaining the peg and would still have a lot of money left.” The team also explained that while LUNA and UST had a ""circular dependency"" with each other, Djed is backed by assets like Cardano ( ADA ) with their own utility that is independent of Djed.  Related:  UST aftermath: Is there any future for algorithmic stablecoins? With concerns spurred by the advent of Djed coming out, Cointelegraph asked some of the major stablecoin projects if algorithmic stablecoin projects still have the potential to succeed despite the example shown by TerraUSD. In a statement, Tether told Cointelegraph that stablecoin projects like Terra had mechanisms designed to achieve stability, but failed in the end. The team explained that:  “Unlike collateralized stablecoins where each coin is fully backed by collateral, algorithmic stablecoins attempt to maintain their value via various market operations that have frequently been broken down dramatically.” Meanwhile, USD Coin ( USDC ) issuer Circle told Cointelegraph in a statement that algorithmic stablecoins with complex collateralization structures and technological stabilization mechanisms do not have the same utility value as full-reserve, regulated dollar assets. “The collapse of Terra earlier this year underscored that not all stablecoins are created equal,” they said.

cardano,No Section,"Cardano Ranks Among Top Staking Networks, Report Finds","In a thread of tweets, crypto researcher  Sooraj  highlights what differentiates Cardano from other proof-of-stake chains, including Ethereum. In mid-September, Ethereum switched from a proof-of-work consensus to a proof-of-stake (PoS) one in a ""Merge"" upgrade. So here are those numbers 
 
Where we compare the total number of 
 
Individual wallets participate in the staking mechanism of both Cardano and Ethereum. #Cardano  has 14x more participation than  #Ethereum https://t.co/2hzAxiHzHw https://t.co/2zYgGC30OM   pic.twitter.com/66naCbHZh7 According to  staking rewards , Cardano ranks as the second largest staking network after Ethereum with a staking market cap of $8 billion, while Ethereum had a $21 billion staking market cap. According to Sooraj, five metrics are key for a PoS-based blockchain: the staking ratio, the initial coin distribution, the Nakamoto Coefficient (MAV), the total number of validator nodes and individual wallets participating in staking. There are primarily two metrics that reflect participation in staking, which are the staking ratio and the number of individual wallets participating in staking. In Cardano, stakers have a choice to run their validators or even delegate ADA to preferred validators. As Cardano has no locking periods, ADA can be re-staked whenever desired. Staking rewards and ETH staking remain locked in Ethereum, with no ability to withdraw. Withdrawals are planned for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. Likewise, staking is dependent on centralized staking providers like Lido and Coinbase. There are two types of Ethereum nodes: nodes that can propose blocks and nodes that cannot. Nodes that propose blocks are few on Ethereum and require committing economic resources such as staked ETH. The other nodes on the network, which form the majority, are not required to commit any economic resources and do not propose blocks, but they still serve a critical role in securing the network. Regarding the degree of participation of total coins in circulation in staking, which refers to the staking ratio, Cardano has a staking ratio of 71%, whereas Ethereum has a staking ratio of 13%. The total number of individual staked wallets in Cardano could be compared to the total number of ""unique depositors"" in Ethereum. In this regard, Cardano could be said to have 14 times more participation than Ethereum.",https://u.today/cardano-ranks-among-top-staking-networks-report-finds,utoday,2022-12-03,13:51:00,en

Hoskinson took to Twitter to share his views on algorithmically-backed stablecoins, i.e., cryptocurrencies that are pegged to fiat rates by smart contract-based technical designs. The concept of algorithmic stablecoins is how we get nation states off of fiat currencies. It's the gold standard of the digital age. Use a deflationary cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ada to collateralize a stable coin that's use as a national currency. Unlike traditional ""centralized"" stablecoins, the balance between the collateral volume and the stablecoin supply is not controlled by the issuer of the stablecoin. Instead, it depends on sophisticated on-chain instruments. It is the concept of an algorithmic stablecoin that can remove the control nation states have over the issuance and circulation of fiat currencies. The adoption of this concept looks inevitable to Hoskinson, as it is equal to a ""gold standard"" in the digital age. To create healthy collateral backing, IOG CEO recommends using Bitcoin (BTC) and Cardano (ADA) as they are deflationary. BTC and ADA liquidity pools will protect stablecoins from losing value. As such, overcollateralized stablecoins backed by Bitcoin (BTC) and Cardano (ADA) can replace national fiat currencies, Hoskinson foresees. While some of his followers appreciated the idea, skeptics recalled that the design of the collapsed TerraUSD (UST) stablecoin looked just the same.

cardano, Analysis , The future of smart contract adoption for enterprises ,"Decentralized finance (DeFi)  markets  may have cooled down over the past year , but the technology powering these applications continues to advance. In particular,  smart contract  platforms that enable transactions to take place across DeFi applications are maturing to meet enterprise requirements.  While it’s notable that enterprises have  previously shown interest in DeFi use cases , smart contract limitations have hampered adoption. A report  published  by Grayscale Research in March puts this in perspective, noting that “Despite handling millions of transactions per day, smart contract platforms in their current state would be incapable of handling even 10% of the worlds’ internet traffic.”  This notion is particularly troublesome considering the market opportunity behind DeFi. For instance, Grayscale Research’s report mentions that DeFi and Metaverse applications combined are likely to have a market capitalization much larger than the current digital asset market.  How smart contracts are advancing Given this potential, it’s become clear that smart contracts must advance in order to accommodate growth. John Woods, chief technology officer of the Algorand Foundation — the supporting organization of the eponymous blockchain ecosystem — told Cointelegraph that today’s smart contracts have a number of technical restrictions, such as scalability issues, which have resulted in slow transaction time and the inability to process complex computations.  Recent:  How smart contracts can improve efficiency in healthcare Woods shared that smart contracts uploaded to the  Algorand blockchain  are applied primarily to traditional DeFi use cases that enable things like automatic trading of on-chain digital assets. Yet, when it comes to enterprise use cases, Woods mentioned that he believes it’s best to put as little information on-chain as possible. He said: “I’ve previously worked with large enterprises that would want to conduct DeFi use cases like post-trade settlement on a blockchain network. When I was building those enterprise applications, I would only put the most important pieces of information on-chain. This would allow smart contracts to perform efficiently without having to do heavy computation on-chain.”  According to Woods, this methodology allows enterprises to benefit from smart contacts, yet only when simple computations are involved. While this may serve as a solution to current limitations, advancements are being made to ensure that all enterprise data can be supported by smart contracts.  For example, Scott Dykstra, chief technology officer and co-founder of Space and Time — a decentralized data platform — told Cointelegraph that his firm is building a community-operated off-chain data platform that can handle any workload in a single cluster.  “We’re working to enable developers to run queries against data we’ve indexed from all major blockchains and data loaded from any off-chain source,” he explained. After queries are run, Dykstra explained that Space and Time uses patented novel cryptography, known as “Proof of SQL,” which can prove each query result is accurate and that the underlying data hasn’t been tampered with.  This is an important point, as Dykstra pointed out that enterprise data queries are typically run in off-chain data warehouses. But, because these data warehouses are centralized, query results often can’t be trusted by a smart contract and, therefore can result in limitations.  Given that Space and Time can cryptographically prove that each data query result is accurate, Dykstra explained that this allows for complex computations to be connected directly to smart contracts without limitations.  “Space and Time’s ability to connect analytic query results directly to smart contracts (with cryptographic guarantees), will serve as a trustless intermediary between enterprise data and the limited storage of the blockchain,” he said. In turn, this process will automate more complex business logic for enterprise use.  Although this solution allows for complex data to be processed by smart contracts, privacy concerns remain. Paul Brody, global blockchain lead at EY, told Cointelegraph that while the value proposition of smart contracts for enterprises is enormous, so are the obstacles. He said: “The biggest is privacy — public blockchains don’t natively support privacy. Since companies consider their buying arrangements to be sensitive information, no firm will deploy these solutions until they are confident in the privacy approach.” Woods is also aware that enterprises are hesitant to use smart contracts due to privacy concerns. “Everything currently done across a public blockchain network is transparent, but enterprise use cases require some level of privacy. What’s coming next is privacy on smart contracts,” he said.  As such, Woods shared that Algorand is currently working on a smart contract privacy solution. While no other details were revealed, Woods — who previously worked as the director of Cardano architecture at Input Output Global (IOHK) — explained that IOHK is also looking into solving privacy around smart contracts with a product called Midnight.  Brody further noted that EY is building tools to enable both private payments and transfers on the public Ethereum network and is developing its own privacy-enabled products. For example, in July 2021,  EY announced the release  of Nightfall 3, a product that combines  zero-knowledge proofs  with Optimistic Rollups to improve transaction efficiency and privacy on Ethereum.  “Nightfall is a zero knowledge-optimistic roll-up for payments and transfers under privacy,” Brody said. He added that  Starlight is another product from EY , which acts as a compiler that converts solidity contracts into zero knowledge, privacy-enabled circuits. “Both are contributions into the public domain and accessible to all,” he said. Even with privacy across smart contracts, anonymity remains an issue for large companies. Weijia Zhang, vice president of engineering at Wanchain and the regional head of China at the  Enterprise Ethereum Alliance , told Cointelegraph that smart contracts today do not have a mechanism to verify a user’s identity. In turn, bad actors can exploit flaws in a smart contract’s design, which can result in stolen assets by unidentified actors. Indeed, this is a major concern as  DeFi hacks continue to increase .  Smart contracts in the future Concerns aside, it’s notable that solutions are being developed to advance smart contract capabilities. Industry experts are, therefore, confident that enterprises will use smart contracts in the future.  “There is no doubt that enterprises will eventually adopt smart contract solutions. There are multiple promising technological innovations occurring in the public blockchain space that have smart contracts at their core,” said Zhang.  That said, it’s important to mention that platforms on which smart contracts execute are also advancing. For example, Woods noted that Algorand focuses on scalability to support enterprise use cases. “It’s not that smart contracts need to get more expressive, but we need to give more resources to smart contracts as well. We also need to focus on scaling blockchains to make sure they are faster and able to connect to more smart contracts per second.” Zhang further explained that a zero-knowledge  Ethereum Virtual Machine  can solve privacy and data challenges, while  cross-chain bridge technology  can solve interoperability issues. He added that  sharding can solve scalability .  Recent:  How NFT court summons could change the legal landscape “Smart contract solutions will revolutionize complex systems that require the participation of multiple parties, resulting in system-wide efficiencies. It’s not that enterprises will want to use these solutions. It’s that they’ll have to,” he said. Yet, Brody mentioned that it’s important to temper expectations, noting:  “Companies implement systems slowly and usually only when necessary, because of a major upgrade or a change in business operations. This means that adoption rates that we see in the consumer world are not likely. What takes a decade for consumers might happen slowly over 30 years in the enterprise space.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/the-future-of-smart-contract-adoption-for-enterprises,cointelegraph,2022-12-03,00:00:00,en
cardano,No Section,Here Are 3 Key Cardano (ADA) Levels You Need To Watch,"Cardano's  price performance in the last few months has been depressing. The asset has lost more than 25% since November and has not been able to gain enough momentum to return to the pre-FTX catastrophe levels. However, the most recent  recovery  might be a sign of an upcoming reversal. In the last 16 days, Cardano has gained approximately 5% to its value from the local low and reached the first short-term resistance level in the form of the 21-day moving average, which usually acts as the first barrier for an asset moving in a prolonged downtrend. In the case of a successful breakout,  ADA  will most likely start moving toward the next resistance level in the form of the 50-day moving average. In the case of a breakthrough, a trend reversal would be way more likely. The next key threshold to watch would be the $0.3 support level, which has been the foundation for every upward move for ADA in November. Even failure during such a breakout attempt would not make a recovery for ADA in the future impossible. Thanks to the resilient support level, Cardano might enter a prolonged consolidation, but not break down even further. Additionally, investors should watch descending volume profiles — a sign of fading trends. Decreasing volume usually reflects the inability or unwillingness of traders and investors to provide more selling pressure and push the price of an asset down. According to profitability indicators,  Cardano  has been severely oversold for months. In order to keep up the pace, bears will have to find additional funding for their shorting operation, which might be a problem during the overall cryptocurrency market recovery.",https://u.today/here-are-3-key-cardano-ada-levels-you-need-to-watch,utoday,2022-12-04,11:30:00,en

In response to Stuart Alderoty’s announcement about Ripple’s reply brief becoming public, the company’s CEO,  Brad Garlinghouse , reaffirmed the opinion that he has been holding since the beginning of the case. Back when the lawsuit started, Garlinghouse stated that Ripple will fight aggressively with the SEC to roll out clear regulatory rules for the crypto space in the U.S. He also praised Ripple's legal team for reaching the current point of submitting the motion for summary judgment earlier this fall. Previously, U.Today reported that the fintech giant and the regulating agency filed motions for summary judgment back in September in an attempt to avoid going to a trial. During a recent discussion on Twitter Spaces, Tesla CEO  Elon Musk  reiterated his support for the original meme crypto, Dogecoin. When asked about the coin, Musk said “Dogecoin to the moon.” The centibillionaire then added that Twitter wanted to make it easier to transact with DOGE, which should be reassuring for token holders as Musk does not plan to abandon the meme coin just yet. All this had a positive effect on the meme coin’s price and made it grow by 5%, reaching the $0.104 level. At the moment of writing, DOGE’s value has increased by 3% more over the past 24 hours; it is now trading at $0.106.

cardano, News ," Cardano’s MuesliSwap introduces ‘organic APR,’ drawing praise, criticism  ","Cardano’s decentralized exchange has announced a new feature to draw in liquidity.  Called “organic APR,” the feature increases token emissions as more liquidity is put into the pool, according to a Twitter thread from the team. It will be introduced into a single pool on Dec. 8 and may be offered in other pools later. The new feature has elicited praise from some Cardano users, but others have expressed dissatisfaction with it. We have developed something special for you! Organic APR ‍ Introducing Organic APR in one sentence: The more people contribute to a pool, the higher the APR  Why do we need it? And how would this work? Check out this thread for more information.  — MuesliSwap (@MuesliSwapTeam)  December 6, 2022 
 
 The team argued that organic APR is necessary because, without it, users would not be incentivized to proselytize for the exchange. The MuesliSwap team explained: “Users [of an exchange without organic APR] want to provide liquidity to earn rewards. But more liquidity providers means earning a smaller part of the emission. Consequently, there is no incentive to spread the word and onboard more users. They will only reduce the APR for early adopters.” Some Cardano users have praised the new feature. For example, one user called it “a cool innovation” and another called it “ingenious.” if i understand correctly, instead of releasing from the get go all the emission rate, and in the beginning there are insane aprs but it goes down quickly. you start slowly, and only release full apr when you reach the liquidity target? ingenious! — ADA goldfish (@cardanogoldfish)  December 7, 2022 
 
 But others have criticized the new feature, claiming that it provides unsustainable yields and will cause inflation. A critic tweeted that the team’s explanation is unclear, asking, “Will you make it transparent how many tokens are left and for how long it will last?” And another user stated his dissatisfaction bluntly: “Printing fake value thru inflationary emissions is everything that’s wrong with defi. This isn’t the way forward.” Printing fake value thru inflationary emissions is everything that’s wrong with defi. This isn’t the way forward. — AltAnon95 (@AltAnon95)  December 7, 2022 
 
 In its thread, the team defended itself against charges of inflationary money-printing. It said that token emissions will stop once a cap is reached, stating: “More participation = faster drain. But emission is capped. The maximum emission will never be exceeded and can give a minimum (!) duration for the yield farming.” The team also claimed that APR will not fall dramatically once the cap is reached, since trading volume will have increased by that time, bringing in more transaction fees.

I'd love to enter the market, but it seems to require someone intimately familiar with it Crypto researcher  Sooraj , who commended IOHK's efforts and collaboration with major universities, believes more awareness of Cardano could have been created if it had done the same in India. Cardano partner EMURGO formally announced its entry into the Indian market with the establishment of the EMURGO Academy in 2019, but Sooraj claims this may not be enough given the magnitude of resources required. Cardano creator Charles Hoskinson responded to this and explained the reason why Cardano has not entered the Indian markets as much as it would like to.  He noted that India has a strong anti-crypto stance, with the government making multiple attempts to outright ban crypto and make its use illegal.

cardano,No Section,First Cardano (ADA) DEX MuesliSwap Pioneers Organic APR Concept,"First-ever decentralized cryptocurrency exchange (DEX) on Cardano and Milkomeda platforms, MuesliSwap, proposes a new concept to make yield farming more attractive and sustainable in a bearish market. In an announcement shared by the MuesliSwap team on Dec. 6, 2022, the concept of Organic APR was unveiled to community enthusiasts. In general, it allows the APR to grow with the growing number of people contributing to the pool. We have developed something special for you! Organic APR 🌿🧑‍🌾 
 
Introducing Organic APR in one sentence: 
 
The more people contribute to a pool, the higher the APR 💰📈 
 
Why do we need it? And how would this work? Check out this thread for more information. 👇 Per the statement, the new concept is set to address the problem of fair yield distribution. In the vast majority of DEXes, the APR for early birds drops as more and more DeFi enthusiasts join this or that pool. As such, DeFi yields are vulnerable to inflation processes so that the earliest members of the yield farming processes have no incentive to invite the next generation of users. To adress this disrepancy, MuesliSwap proposes the concept of ""Organic APR"" designed to increase APY rates together with the increased number of stakers. For instance, as a pool reaches 500,000 ADA in TVL, its stakers can enjoy 7.3% APR. If the pool's TVL scales by 10x, the APY also spikes to 73%. While the majority of MuesliSwap enthusiasts appreciated the new concept, some of them were skeptical and opined that the full scheme would drain LP token reserves. To address this controversy, MuesliSwap developers made it clear that the total emission level will be limited: More participation = faster drain. But emission is capped. The maximum emission will never be exceeded and can give a minimum (!) duration for the yield farming. Transparently displaying the remaining reserves + giving an estimate based on the current APR could be another option. As covered by U.Today previously, after the Vasil hard fork was activated, major DeFis on Cardano (ADA) registered an inflow of new users. MuesliSwap, being the flagship protocol of the segment, witnessed 788% growth in user count in a matter of weeks alone.",https://u.today/first-cardano-ada-dex-muesliswap-pioneers-organic-apr-concept,utoday,2022-12-07,15:59:00,en

Traders who commit it can potentially secure risk-free profits. DEXes have to look for different ways to prevent such attacks.  In a  tweet , Minswap said that it had started investigating possible front-running on the DEX. “We are working on a fix to prevent it from happening again and we are working hard to finish that as soon as possible,” the project tweeted.  In a follow-up announcement,  Minswap  confirmed that the issue had been fixed. The attacker has now started canceling newly created orders because he cannot get ahead of the user.  The Minswap is currently working on a detailed report that deals with the incident.  
 
According to data provided by DefiLlama, Minswap is the most prominent decentralized finance application on the Cardano blockchain with a total value locked (TVL) of $28.45 million. ",https://u.today/leading-cardano-dex-suffers-front-running-attack,utoday,2022-12-08,19:48:00,en

Speaking of Plutus, it is the smart contract platform of the Cardano blockchain that allows for the writing of applications that interact with the blockchain. Plutus Core is a scripting language used in the Cardano ledger. September's Vasil upgrade brought about a new version of Plutus Core (Plutus V2), a tuned Plutus interpreter and new cost models for both Plutus V1 and Plutus V2 scripts. The Cardano network reached the significant milestone of 3,000 Plutus scripts at the start of August and has shown no signs of slowing down since then. On Sept. 22, the date of the Vasil hard fork, the number of smart contracts or Plutus scripts stood at 3,292. According to the most recent weekly report compiled by Cardano builder IOG, the number of Plutus scripts is 4,347, of which 400 are Plutus V2 scripts. Currently, 1,151 projects are in various stages of development on the Cardano blockchain. There are also 7.2 million native tokens minted across 66,530 policies.

Author of world-famous bestseller ""Rich Dad, Poor Dad""  Robert Kiyosaki  has once again expressed support for Bitcoin, naming the driver that will, in his opinion, push the king crypto to new highs. Kiyosaki believes that holders of Bitcoin, gold and silver will get richer as these assets are going to increase in price after the Fed, Treasury and Wall Street pivot and start printing “trillions of fake dollars.” He then proceeded to say that when this happens, those who are saving ""fake money"" will be the ""biggest losers."" On Dec. 10,  Charles Hoskinson  held another AMA session on YouTube, answering the questions of his followers. During the session, he touched upon the Ripple case, saying that he heard “rumors” that the two-year-long legal battle with the SEC could come to its end on Dec. 15. Later this weekend,  David Gokhshtein  commented on Hoskinson’s statement, saying that the settlement between Ripple and the regulator will not happen “unless there’s clarity.” The Cardano creator replied by asking Gokhshtein to “stop spreading fake news” and that these were rumors he was citing, which are different from what he believes. Shibburn website reports a massive spike in the  Shiba Inu  network’s burn rate. According to recent data, yesterday, the burn rate of SHIB surged by an astounding 910%, which makes it one of the biggest burn increases in the last few weeks. The biggest contribution to the burning was made by the address ending with 3963d, which removed more than 5 million tokens from circulation. Unfortunately, this rise in burning volume did not have any effect on SHIB’s price. At the moment of writing, the token is trading at $0.000008842, down almost 4% over the past 24 hours, per CoinMarketCap. Good news for the  SHIB community : as announced by DFINITY's official Twitter handle, it will soon be possible to natively hold SHIB on the Internet Computer blockchain. Such functionality was enabled thanks to chain key ECDSA, which requires no bridge. SHIB is not the only “lucky crypto”; the Dogecoin meme token was also announced to become available for holding natively. As reported by  U.Today , Shiba Inu continues seeing increased exposure.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Protected Much Better Than FTX from Crash and Bankruptcy: Source,"Twitter user @Cardanians_io has explained to Crypto Twitter why  Cardano  is much better protected against the fate of FTX and the troubles that hit another major crypto exchange, Binance, yesterday. @Cardanians_io reminded the community that the founder of FTX, former billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried, was  taken into custody  in the Bahamas just recently at the request of U.S. prosecutors. The arrest took place before SBF was able to testify before the U.S. Congress about the collapse of the FTX exchange in early November. As  covered by U.Today  earlier, Binance may face charges of money laundering and violating sanctions from the U.S. prosecutor's office, according to a report by Reuters. Head of Binance, CZ, commented on this news, calling it FUD. However, investors began to withdraw funds from the platform – mainly Ethereum and ERC20 tokens – for fear of Binance repeating the fate of FTX and SBF. Over the past week, investors and traders have withdrawn roughly $2 billion worth of cryptocurrencies. @Cardanians_io stated that unlike FTX and Binance, Cardano is a decentralized network that does not have a CEO. Therefore, ""There is no one to arrest."" SBF is under arrest. Chances are CZ will also be arrested as  @Binance  is accused of money laundering. This bear market may destroy the 2 largest exchanges in the  #blockchain  industry. #Cardano  has no CEO. The network is decentralized and there is no one to arrest. Prominent investor Mike Alfred has commented on the recent outflow of crypto from Binance. He tweeted that traders are selling their BNB and BUSD, converting them into Bitcoin and Ethereum or any other coin that can be withdrawn from Binance quickly. Alfred pointed out that this is the first time in several years that there is a ""real market driven price action"" for the native coins of the Binance exchange. He also tweeted that BNB, Binance's coin, is plunging as selling pressure on it increases. BNB $262. Dumping harder. Sell pressure up. I assume CZ is selling as well to meet redemption requests. Hot wallet balances drained. Since the evening of Dec. 12, the BNB price dropped from the $284 level, reaching a $257.9 low. By now, the asset has managed to recover some of its losses and is trading at $269.2, as per CoinMarketCap.

On Dec. 12, 2,971 new wallets were created on the Cardano network, up by 1,099 from the day before. The likely surge in new wallets on the  Cardano  network is related to the FUD around Binance, which is the largest staking provider of ADA, according to the Staking Rewards portal. Thus, the black-and-yellow giant, accused by the press of money laundering and sanctions violations, is the site of $600 million in  ADA staking , representing 7.34% of all tokens in staking pools. At the same time, this theory may have roots, but it is not supported by the rest of the blockchain insights, which have not demonstrated any uniqueness.

cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Says He Might End up With Egg on His Face, Ripple CTO Slams “Shark Tank” Star, 750 Billion SHIB Sent to Binance: Crypto News Digest by U.Today","Check out the top four news stories over the past day presented to you by U.Today. Yesterday , Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson tweeted that he might end up with egg on his face if the rumors he shared during his AMA session about the Ripple-SEC case turn out to be fake. Last Sunday, Dec. 11, Hoskinson said both parties could  reach a settlement  soon, naming the date on which it might take place, Dec. 15. Back then, his remark had raised a lot of speculation in the crypto community, with the majority of commentators having a negative reaction to it. According to James K. Filan’s prediction made last month, the case would be resolved on or before March 31, 2023. At Wednesday's hearing held by the Senate Banking Committee, Canadian businessman and ""Shark Tank"" star  Kevin O'Leary  blamed Binance for the collapse of FTX. According to him, the two entities were rivals, and ""one put the other out of business,"" alleging that Binance did it on purpose. This statement was not left unnoticed by Ripple CTO David Schwartz. He took to Twitter to say that O'Leary is making those claims ""against the entire weight of an absurdly massive amount of evidence.""  Previously , Schwartz stated that FTX crashed due to the fact that it used customers' funds while also failing to manage risks. According to Etherscan data shared by @shibaplay_ Twitter user, yesterday, whales shifted close to  800 billion SHIB  to Binance in four transactions. The transfers carried from 150 billion to 207.8 billion meme tokens. 207 billion SHIB was sent to a Binance wallet from an unknown address. Another SHIB lump of the same size was moved between anonymous wallets. The third transaction of 150,000,000,000 SHIB worth $1,336,500 was again sent to the Binance exchange. Meanwhile, on Dec. 14, Binance CEO CZ announced on his Twitter page that the situation regarding massive withdrawals from the exchange had stabilized and deposits started coming back in. Magic Square platform has recently announced on Twitter that  Baby Doge Swap  is now added to Magic Store, a Web3 app store that allows users to discover dApps, CeFi and DeFi, NFTs, games and much more. Apart from that, Baby Doge Coin has set a new milestone as nearly half of its total supply of 420 quadrillion have been burned. At the moment, 200.56 quadrillion BabyDoge tokens have been destroyed, which comprises 47.753% of the total supply of 420 quadrillion of BabyDoge.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Is Done with XRP,"In a  recent video statement , Input Output CEO Charles Hoskinson said that he would completely remove himself from any discussions involving XRP after the community kept harassing him due to a false rumor about a Dec. 15 settlement between Ripple and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  Hoskinson explained that one of his listeners simply asked a question about whether or not  ADA  could be classified as an unregistered security in the US, and what would Cardano do in such a case.  While sharing his take on the issue, Hoskinson made an off-hand comment about the  Ripple case . Hoskinson claims that the case is an “industry-wide concern,” which is why he touched upon the issue.  The Cardano founder clarified that he heard the rumor from a “pretty reliable source” close to the case.  Yet, after the rumor shared by Hoskinson expectedly ended up being false, he was accused of lying by members of the XRP community. “I don’t know how to interact with the XRP community,” Hoskinson said.  The Cardano founder says that he himself doesn’t view the XRP token as an unregistered security in spite of the SEC’s allegations.  However, he also doesn’t believe that there was any sort of corruption involved, reiterating his view that it is just a conspiracy theory that is being promoted by XRP fans. Hoskinson argues that Ethereum received a more gentle treatment from the regulatory agency due to its size, scope, and scale. The cryptocurrency mogul says that he was previously “mocked,” “harassed” and “brutalized” by the XRP community for not buying into its conspiracy theories.  Hence,  Hoskinson  sees no value in mentioning XRP or responding to XRP-related questions.  The Cardano founder says that he’s not going to discuss the resolution of the XRP case.  “Never in my career in this space have I encountered a community so willing to viciously attack a person who, frankly, has not attacked them,” Hoskinson said. “I’m sorry it’s come to this, but I’m just frankly tired,” he added. ",https://u.today/cardano-founder-is-done-with-xrp,utoday,2022-12-16,19:58:00,en

cardano,No Section,Major Cardano (ADA) Innovations Unveiled and Explained by Developers,"Several important improvements to the Cardano ecosystem have been unveiled today by the various developers operating within it. The innovations include both the blockchain itself and the decentralized applications built on it. The first development can be  considered  the so-called CIP-1694, where the acronym stands for Cardano Improvement Proposal. This innovation, developed in co-authorship with Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, is a mechanism for on-chain governance that will be a precursor to the transition to the Voltaire phase in Cardano. Glad to see the community going through this. I'd encourage everyone in cardano to do readings of the CIP and share your opinions both pro and con  https://t.co/rvJ8eXTld1 The proposal put forward by developer Jared Cordouan in late November is now in the voting process. Voltaire itself, as explained by Hoskinson, is intended to be the latest stage in the development of the  Cardano network  and to set an example for the rest of the industry as to how decentralized management is done. Another major recent  innovation  is the development of a price index for Cardano native tokens by the dcSpark team. The idea is that the index can be deployed locally and for free, without the need for an API or third party. For reference, the number of native tokens on  Cardano  currently stands at over 7 million. You can now run your own local price indexer for Cardano native assets 😍 
 
You can run it entirely locally with no trusted API server to pay for! 
 
3 DEXs supported for now, but more may be added in the future 👍 
 
Another successful Catalyst proposal by our team🙏  https://t.co/0khuz8Psiu The index already has the support of the three largest decentralized exchanges on Cardano by total value locked: Minswap, WingRiders and SundaeSwap. Cardano remains one of the most actively developed projects in the crypto industry.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) and XRP ‘Fight’: Understand What's Going On,"The faces behind Cardano (ADA) and XRP got into a fight recently, even though they are projects with different fundamentals. But why did this happen? After all, both altcoins have dissimilar value propositions. While Cardano is consolidating as a decentralized smart contract platform, XRP is focused on being a token for low-fee cross-border payments. What altcoins do have in common is that they have a strong community, and this is exactly what Charles Hoskinson, founder of ADA, attacked XRP on. According to the entrepreneur, the seventh-place altcoin community is toxic and petty. However, this was not Hoskinson's only claim. He also claimed that the project developed by Ripple lacked partnerships and value, and that he was cutting ties with XRP for these reasons. The  Cardano  creator's accusations came shortly after the XRP community called him a liar. Hoskinson had stated, citing reliable sources, that the SEC's case against Ripple would close on Dec. 15, 2022. However, the fight that started in 2020, still has not ended, and this was a reason for XRP supporters to riot and attack the entrepreneur. Ripple CTO David Schwartz  responded  to the American businessman. Schwartz, either intending to calm tempers or simply preparing a surprise for XRP holders, said that Hoskinson should wait a few days and then get back to the publication to make sure that is what he meant. In October, Hoskinson became embroiled in another feud with the XRP community due to a theory on the cryptocurrency market that the SEC favored Ethereum (ETH) over other tokens in the blockchain milieu. In 2018, William Hinman was the SEC chairman and the person responsible for opening the case against Ripple. He gave a speech with comments about Ethereum's legal status. Hinman expressed that the altcoin, like Bitcoin (BTC), is not a security. The XRP army believes that Hinman acted to favor ETH. To illustrate, between 2017 and 2018, four planned meetings with representatives of the market's leading altcoin took place, where they had privileged access to the SEC, something no other blockchain market protocol had. In addition, Hinman was a partner in the law firm Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP prior to his work at the SEC. But what does this have to do with anything? This firm is part of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA), which aims to commercialize the smart contract platform. This survey was criticized by Hoskinson, who stated that the SEC is not after Ripple because of a conspiracy, but because the United States does not have clear regulation of cryptocurrencies. The XRP community quickly attacked the businessman, who said in his speech that what was said was taken out of context. The defender of the Twitter profile token, @Truth_hurts_hmm, countered and said that Hoskinson wants to rewrite history as if nothing had happened, but that something did happen and his speech was contextualized. In this case, even with Hoskinson claiming to be a Ripple supporter in the court case against the SEC, much of the XRP community does not see it that way. However, when it comes to the controversial creator of Cardano, this is nothing new. Hoskinson, besides having developed one of Ethereum's (ETH) main competitors, is known for his controversial statements. He has said that in the crypto market there are people who like him and people who hate him, and it is very difficult to find someone who feels neutral about him. The entrepreneur behind Cardano has already criticized the major cryptocurrencies on the market. For the entrepreneur, Bitcoin has an outdated and slow consensus model. As such, he declared in October that mining of the primary cryptocurrency should be stopped. In Hoskinson's view, the blockchain area does not need the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism because it optimizes a network only to fulfill the mission of transferring values without having much success in other areas. The entrepreneur believes that all existing BTC units should be converted into Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). In short, WBTC manages to get Bitcoin into decentralized finance, which is something that cryptocurrency holders could not enjoy. This being the case, it leads to the enormous liquidity of Bitcoin on centralized exchanges. In Hoskinson's analysis, Wrapped Bitcoin is still Bitcoin, because it has all the properties and features of the asset. Regarding Ethereum, the entrepreneur stated that the altcoin team ignored the Ouroboros protocol for years, something that caused a major delay in proof-of-stake delivery to the ETH network.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-and-xrp-fight-understand-whats-going-on,utoday,2022-12-22,01:30:00,en

cardano,No Section,Cardano's First Stablecoin: What You Should Know About iUSD,"Cardano (ADA) investors are eagerly awaiting the launch of stablecoins on the altcoin network in 2023. However, few people know about this synthetic stable asset that is already present on the smart contract platform, iUSD. Early next year, centralized stablecoin USDA and algorithmic stablecoin  Djed  are expected to debut on Cardano. While the former will maintain its parity with the U.S. dollar through backing in fiduciary assets, the latter will be backed by a pool of base currencies. Expectations for the arrival of the two  stablecoins  are high, as stable assets could be the driver that ADA needs for increased capitalization and greater adoption within and outside of the cryptocurrency market. However, even if it has not been very prominent, Cardano already has a stable asset on its network, the synthetic stablecoin iUSD that was launched by Indigo, a standalone synthetic protocol for on-chain exposure to real-world assets. The use of synthetic assets in the blockchain industry has grown in recent years as they can track the value of various off-chain assets such as indices, stocks and fiat currencies and bring them into the crypto market so that they can be traded on-chain. This is precisely what is seen in iUSD. The iUSD token tracks the price of the main stablecoins on the market: USDC, USDT and TUSD. Thus, through its design, it manages to average the price of the aforementioned stable assets. The main aim is to ensure that, even in situations of market decline, the stablecoin manages to maintain its 1:1 peg against the U.S. dollar. In addition, Indigo seeks to keep prices fixed and stabilized by providing incentives for investors to arbitrage. As a result, the stablecoin would be backed by ADA tokens and the market would be responsible for stabilizing the asset's peg. However, it is worth noting that, at times, the iUSD may lose this peg, and this was anticipated as the token is  designed  so that it can trade between $0.90 and $1.10. At the time of writing, the stablecoin is traded at $0.95. Although this instability was expected, as the project has yet to start, there is a further point that must be discussed. iUSD still lacks the liquidity and volume to shed its volatility. However, its working mechanism may attract doubts due to the stablecoin algorithm being collateral-based. By participating in the iUSD pool, those who make deposits will earn a premium generated by their settlements. Every coin has a minimum premium of 10% above cost. According to the project’s presentation, ""If market forces force the collateral below this threshold, automatic liquidation occurs, and the premium is passed on to the Stability Pool participants as a reward.” As such, there is an incentive for iUSD to trade outside the $1 mark so that people can buy, drive the price up and sell at a profit. Also, the higher the price of iUSD, the higher the ADA reward in staking. In other words, hardly an investor will be motivated to let the stablecoin keep its peg.",https://u.today/cardanos-first-stablecoin-what-you-should-know-about-iusd,utoday,2022-12-23,00:00:00,en

The recent events, notably the FTX implosion, has in a way vindicated Cardano.

cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder's Photo with Snoop Dogg Boosts Cardano NFT Sales by 33%,"According to  CryptoSlam , Cardano-based NFT sales have increased by more than 30% in the last 24 hours. The reason for such a big move was probably the joint photo by Cardano's founder and hip-hop legend and entrepreneur Snoop Dogg. Hell of a night with  @SnoopDogg  and friends. Time for the afterparty  pic.twitter.com/5GArtrUIWQ It seems that Snoop Dogg's emergence as Cardano's key face has opened many eyes to NFT on this blockchain. Snoop himself is a well-known lover of digital art. According to the same data, the number of  Cardano NFT  buyers increased by 94.5% in the last 24 hours. The total value of sales in 24 hours was $313,000. That said, this is not the first public intervention by Charles Hoskinson and Snoop Dogg. They even appeared together in a music video of the rap legend's son, Cordell Broadus, a.k.a. Champ Medici, for a track from an album dedicated to crypto and ADA in particular.

cardano,No Section,"Charles Hoskinson Trolls Ethereum PoS Model, Mentions Comics by Scott Adams","Charles Hoskinson , founder of IOG, the company behind the Cardano Foundation giant, has taken to Twitter to once again troll the PoS model that was implemented by the Ethereum chain in September this year. It was introduced by Ethereum during its long-anticipated Merge upgrade, which was expected to push the price up significantly. Hoskinson referred to comics by Scott Raymond Adams, the creator of the Dilbert comic strip. These were about being unable to withdraw crypto from an exchange, which is exactly the situation with Ethereum staking now. I didn't realize  @ScottAdamsSays  wrote comics about Ethereum's staking model  pic.twitter.com/tClkRBTfAs This is not the first time the founder of Cardano has complained about the way Ethereum introduced proof of stake. Ethereum staking was launched in early December 2020, and the Merge upgrade, which would include transfer to PoS, was expected since then as part of Ethereum 2.0 future integration. The upgrade was finally made in the middle of September this year after constant delays — two years since Beacon Chain was launched. However, after Merge was implemented, it turned out that withdrawals of ETH from the deposit contract are not allowed until the next upgrade of Ethereum — Shanghai. The latter is scheduled six months after Merge, in the first quarter of 2023. Hoskinson has already mocked Ethereum PoS for this several times, since proof of stake on the Cardano chain allows users to withdraw their ADA from staking pools anytime. Besides, their ADA coins do not even have to be moved from their private wallets to be staked. In one of his tweets published this fall, Hoskinson said that Cardano stakers do not have to be wealthy, unlike those on the Ethereum network, and that is the philosophical difference between the two blockchains. This was Hoskinson's comment on a  Discord message of Micah Zoltu , founder of Serv.eth Support, published on Twitter. Stakers on Cardano are everyday people who don't need to be wealthy. I guess that's the philosophical difference  https://t.co/ScJ6hZKlMi",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-trolls-ethereum-pos-model-mentions-comics-by-scott-adams,utoday,2022-12-24,12:20:00,en
cardano,No Section,Cardano Founder Reacts to Vitalik Buterin's Take on Twitter CEO Search,"Ethereum co-founder  Vitalik Buterin , in a recent tweet, urged Elon Musk not to hastily appoint a replacement for Twitter's CEO. The Tesla CEO, who acquired Twitter in late October to the excitement of several Twitter users, expressed the desire to step down as its CEO once he finds ""someone foolish enough to take the job."" This came as over 57.5% of users voted in favor of his resignation, a result he promised to adhere to. The Ethereum creator indicated that, as much as he is eager to see who the next CEO would be, an overly hasty executive search can lead to ruinous results; ""I know this from painful personal experience,"" Buterin quipped. That's funny, thought the same thing Buterin's tweet caught the attention of the Cardano founder,  Charles Hoskinson , who responded by expressing that he shared the same view. ""That's funny, thought the same thing,"" Hoskinson tweeted. Given the history of the relationship between the two founders, some Twitter users have read various meanings into Charles Hoskinson's ""seemingly innocuous"" tweet. Hoskinson left Ethereum after a falling out with the other co-founders over differing opinions about whether the Ethereum project should be commercial or not. Thus, Buterin and Hoskinson have had a history of feuding. After he eventually left Ethereum in June 2014, Hoskinson seemed to have reconciled with Buterin. During a recent ask-me-anything session, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson voiced his readiness to work with Vitalik Buterin again. He claims that if the project is right for him, he would be willing to collaborate with the Ethereum co-founder. As reported by  U.Today , Hoskinson teased Buterin that it was not too late for him to switch to Cardano earlier this year.",https://u.today/cardano-founder-reacts-to-vitalik-buterins-take-on-twitter-ceo-search,utoday,2022-12-24,12:47:00,en
cardano,No Section,Nansen CEO Mocks Cardano Bros as ADA Underperforms SHIB,"Alex Svanevik, founder and CEO of blockchain analytics platform Nansen, recently  took to Twitter  with a pointed jab aimed at Cardano’s native cryptocurrency.  He tweeted the following: ""Cardano bros never thanked me for this.""  The “this” Svanevik was referring to was a prediction that he had made back in March, stating ""Last chance to sell ADA above $30B market cap."" It seems Svanevik has been proven correct, as ADA has seen an awful year price performance-wise. The cryptocurrency is down an astounding 91.67% from its all-time high. Moreover, it is down 81% on a year-to-date basis - more than even meme coin Shiba Inu (77%). Svanevik's foresight might have saved some investors from massive losses this year, but there doesn't seem to be much cause for optimism for those still holding onto their ADA coins heading into 2023. With the industry still reeling from the FTX collapse and the U.S. Federal Reserve not backing away from its hawkish monetary policy, market sentiment remains extremely bearish.  As  reported by U.Today , cryptocurrency veteran Bobby Lee predicted that another crypto bull market cycle wouldn’t start until 2025.   Svanevik's jab against ADA is not surprising since he is a supporter of Ethereum, a major Cardano competitor. The Ether cryptocurrency is down 75.14% from its all-time high. ",https://u.today/nansen-ceo-mocks-cardano-bros-as-ada-underperforms-shib,utoday,2022-12-25,16:41:00,en
cardano,No Section,Charles Hoskinson Says That ADA Not Getting Listed on Gemini Is Good Thing,"During a  Sunday conversation  on Twitter Spaces, Hoskinson commented that it is probably a good thing that Cardano has not been listed on Gemini. ""We are still not listed on Gemini. Turns out that's probably a good thing cause FTX didn't list us either,"" he said. He complained that it took years for the cryptocurrency to get listed on Coinbase, the largest U.S. exchange. FTX, the now-defunct crypto exchange, went bankrupt last month before it could launch a spot ADA pair. Only a few weeks previous to the exchange’s implosion, founder Sam Bankman-Fried tweeted that they planned to add ADA to the exchange. Notably, ADA was the only major cryptocurrency without an FTX listing. Last month, Gemini also got caught up in the Genesis drama. According to the Financial Times, the troubled crypto lender owes the Winklevii-led exchange $900 million. ADA  remains within the top 10 on crypto ranking site CoinMarketCap despite its massive correction this year. Hoskinson has taken a firm stance against those who are spreading ""lies"" about the Cardano blockchain. ""It's a bald-faced lie to say that there is no development activity,"" Hoskinson firmly asserted during the recent conversion. He further explained his hardened stance toward critics by proclaiming how he ""just has no tolerance anymore"" for anyone who spreads false information about  Cardano . ""What I'm not happy to do is to indulge lies, straight-up lies about adoption, which they all are,"" added Hoskinson as he continued to emphasize his intolerance toward critics lying about the progress of Cardano's development and adoption.",https://u.today/charles-hoskinson-says-that-ada-not-getting-listed-on-gemini-is-good-thing,utoday,2022-12-26,08:13:00,en
cardano,No Section,"Cardano, Solana and Avalanche: What to Expect from Ethereum's Competitors in 2023","As noted in 2022, Ethereum's (ETH) competitors had a bad year. Although they were the big highlights of 2021, in recent months they have suffered from the bear market alongside other altcoins. But may this change in 2023? One of the big bets for market growth next year are projects linked to scalability on ETH's network, such as  Polygon  (MATIC) and Arbitrum. As the Surge is scheduled to take place in 2023 and will be the update that will bring a more scalable blockchain to the leading smart contract platform, it is expected that this issue will be widespread and lead altcoins to a possible capitalization gain. However, this does not mean that Ethereum killers will not have their place in the spotlight. Although they have challenges that need to be overcome, some highlights may be seen on Cardano (ADA), Solana (SOL) and Avalanche (AVAX). Let's look at what 2023 might look like for Ethereum's main competitors. In first place is the oldest altcoin on this list. Cardano was launched in 2017 and has one of the strongest communities in the blockchain industry. Although in 2022 the ADA lost more than 90% of its all-time high seen in September of last year, it has maintained its network validators with one of the most attractive staking programs on the market. Moreover, Cardano managed to pass the 4,000 smart contracts mark and has one of the most developed blockchains on the crypto market, proving that developers have maintained their interest in the altcoin. Right after Solana's giant fall, the cryptocurrency gained even more room to grow in capitalization. Furthermore, in 2023, stablecoins will arrive on the ADA network, and this could be a bullish catalyst for the cryptocurrency. After all, more stablecoin assets could cause it to continue increasing its total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi). However, the dark side of a stablecoin can also plague Cardano. In 2022, the crypto market observed how projects that were working with stable assets suffered, as maintaining a token's parity with the U.S. dollar is not an easy task.  Waves, Terra Classic and Tron have shown great failure because of their stablecoins, and this may be the downside that binds ADA next year. Without a doubt,  Solana  is the altcoin on this list that needs to reinvent itself the most, and not only because of SOL's constant network outages. The altcoin has experienced a sharp decline because it is a crypto backed by Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF), and the entrepreneur's companies have staked a large amount of money not only on Solana but also on tokens from its ecosystem. However, this has not affected Solana's growth in the non-fungible token (NFT) sector. After Ethereum, Solana's network remained the leader in this market. Of course, it should be noted that Solana has a fast network and low fees, something that while not unique to the altcoin, is still attractive. Meantime, in 2023, Solana may cling not only to these points, as this may not be a bullish factor for its token. The NFT market is seeking more maturity, so highs as in 2021 may not be seen, and this may not favor Solana in a market where scalability alone does not count for capitalization highs. Avalanche was also one of the cryptos negatively affected by one of the 2022 collapses. When the Terraform Labs empire collapsed in May, AVAX plummeted 30%. In fact, this was a major fear for holders of the altcoin. By hitting the $32.50 mark, the crypto reached a level not seen since September 2021. The drop occurred because investors feared a sale of AVAX that could be held by Luna Foundation Guard (LFG). The foundation had purchased over $70 million in Avalanche to hold the crypto as one of the protectors of the former UST peg. However, this was no deterrent for the Avalanche team to make important partnerships and releases that can help the Ethereum competitor stand out in 2023. A notable example of this is the arrival of the Core cryptocurrency wallet, which in addition to being compatible with Avalanche, is adaptable to other EVM-compliant blockchain ecosystems. The wallet has even caught the attention of Coinbase, one of the leading exchanges on the crypto market. The Bitcoin and altcoin trading platform now allows its users a new option to convert money into cryptocurrency in the Core extension for use in DeFi, NFTs and transfers.",https://u.today/cardano-solana-and-avalanche-what-to-expect-from-ethereums-competitors-in-2023,utoday,2022-12-27,01:30:00,en

ADA, on the other hand, has been actively competing with XRP over the past year for a place closer to the sun, constantly moving between sixth and eighth places. However, the drop in quotations in recent days has pushed it to the bottom 10 and given the lead to DOGE.

User ADA Whale shared that the price action of crypto in the current bear market was surreal. He admitted that ""inorganic and nefarious activities by certain exchanges"" played an important role here, obviously hinting at the collapse of FTX at the start of November. He added that the crypto space is not regulated well enough. Since Friday, Dec. 16, ADA has lost a staggering 16%, dropping from $0.30 to $0.25 at the moment. It was here that  Mike Alfred  stepped in. He believes that, at the moment, ADA in particular is coming close to the targets he set 18-24 months ago, even though back at that time they seemed unlikely. Overall, Alfred reckons that this bearish phase will end within the period of three to nine months. Or it's just a bear market. We're getting near my ADA price targets from 18-24 months ago. Felt very unlikely at the time. But that's always the case at extremes. This phase will be over in 3-9 months. In another tweet published today, Mike Alfred noted that Binance Coin (BNB) is again ""suspiciously outperforming"" the crypto market today. He said that is happening despite a rising amount of ""proof of fraud and market manipulation"" related to this major cryptocurrency exchange. According to Alfred, Binance and the marketmakers affiliated with it are using users' deposits to support the price of BNB. BNB is back to suspiciously outperforming the rest of the crypto market in spite of an increasing amount of proof of fraud and market manipulation. How much of your Binance deposits are being used by CZ's affiliated market makers to support the price of BNB? This is wild. Earlier today, BNB added nearly 2% against USDT but has lost nearly all these gains at the time of this writing. Over the weekend, Binance Coin managed to rise by an astonishing 11.75%, recapturing the level of $252 after dropping to $225. At press time, the token is changing hands at $243.7. Earlier today, news was spread that  Binance was removing  certain spot trading pairs of small-cap tokens trading against Ethereum and BNB.

cardano,No Section,Cardano (ADA) Can Now Be Staked on Apple Devices via This Integration,"Cardano's native token, ADA, has become available for staking on Apple devices that use the iOS operating system. In particular, the innovation has been  implemented  through the functionality of Trust Wallet, a noncustodial ""hot"" wallet for storing crypto assets. Initially, such a feature was only available in Trust Wallet on devices supporting the Android operating system. Hey iOS users! You can now stake  @Cardano   $ADA  too, easily and directly in your  #TrustWallet ! 
 
Our detailed guide and FAQ below 👇 https://t.co/LpFyWTiBmC   https://t.co/gMMZeoBbzZ The minimum amount that can be staked is 4 ADA. Tokens and rewards for staking will automatically be restaked at the end of each epoch, as is customary on  Cardano . What is more, the functionality allows you to choose your own validator pool, of which Cardano currently has more than 2,700, according to Cexplorer. Being a proof-of-stake blockchain, staking is of defining importance to Cardano, so the ability to seamlessly delegate ADA to staking from an iPhone seems like a very positive development — especially given Trust Wallet's user base of tens of millions and the fact that the wallet's parent company,  Binance , is the largest staking provider for  ADA . Currently, the number of Cardano tokens in staking is 25.08 billion ADA, or 72% of the total token supply. Thus, the capitalization of Cardano tokens in staking is $6.3 billion. Despite the drop in ADA's price, the number of new wallets, as well as the number of tokens in staking, is regularly increasing.",https://u.today/cardano-ada-can-now-be-staked-on-apple-devices-via-this-integration,utoday,2022-12-28,11:42:00,en

binance,Opinion,A Hobbyist Crypto Trader's Life in Tax Hell,"Chandan Lodha is co-founder at  CoinTracker,  a portfolio and tax manager for cryptocurrency. He can be reached on Twitter  here . The following article is an exclusive contribution to CoinDesk's  Crypto and Taxes  2018 series. As a hobbyist investor, my first foray into cryptocurrency was with Coinbase.  I was buying a few coins here and there, and everything was simple enough to manage in a spreadsheet. I would record the date, time and amount bought and sold for every transaction. This worked well enough for the first 10 transactions. Soon, however, like many others in the space, I found myself deep down the cryptocurrency rabbit hole.  I had exchange accounts on GDAX, Poloniex, Binance and a bunch of others. I was buying privacy coins on decentralized exchanges. I had read about the large-scale exchange hacks which burned many folks in the past, so I set up cold storage hardware wallets and ended up with over 15 different wallets for different types of altcoins. Still, I was a hobbyist; I was new to the space and just tinkering with small amounts of these coins, learning, curious to see how this digital, decentralized economy operated and how the underlying technologies all worked.  It was fascinating, but also confusing as hell.  The moment I moved a single coin out of Coinbase, the exchange no longer had an accurate reporting of my holdings and transactions so its  tax report  was incorrect. My own spreadsheet was getting unwieldy, as I started to integrate Google Apps scripts to look up exchange prices from the different exchange accounts I had, plus match-up cost bases for wallet-to-wallet transfers.  The spreadsheet got more and more complicated, until one day it took two minutes to load.  Money on the line That was the breaking point – there had to be a better way than running this hacky spreadsheet.  Normally, for a side project I wouldn’t have cared, but this was actual money on the line and I didn’t have a clue how much fiat money (U.S. dollars) I had invested. How was I going to calculate my capital gains taxes on crypto if I didn’t even know how much money I have invested in the first place? It was becoming financially irresponsible for me to not have a better grasp of this. I turned to my friend sitting next to me and asked him how he was solving the same problem for himself. He turned his laptop to me: a nearly identical complicated spreadsheet (in fairness, his was better than mine).  There was no way that mainstream users were jumping through these hoops. We immediately started researching what other crypto-enthusiasts were using to solve the tracking problem. To our disappointment, there were no good tools. The most popular tool was a mobile app that operated like a stock ticker app: it would show you the prices of coins daily and, if you wanted, allowed you to manually add these coins into a portfolio, one at a time.  This was even worse than the spreadsheet we already had and wasn’t at all personalized to our particular portfolios, let alone calculating our cost basis, capital gains, or providing any useful information for taxes. Then and there, my friend and I decided to stop doing what we were doing and productionize our spreadsheets (OK,  his  spreadsheet) into a simple website. It was the first incarnation of what has now become CoinTracker. Takeaways The moral of the story: make sure you keep good records of your transactions, or use exchanges which provide these records for you.  If you are using multiple exchanges and wallets, trading multiple coins, or using secure cold or local storage for your coins (which everyone should do) then there are several tools out there which can help you track your whole portfolio, your return on investment, the amount of fiat invested, and perhaps most importantly your cost basis and capital gains. In the future, ideally the IRS will help clarify the tax rules which apply to cryptocurrency, especially around grey-area issues such as like-kind exchange (retroactively), which accounting methods are acceptable for capital gains (e.g. FIFO, HIFO, etc.), and airdropped coins.  Until then I hope to see exchanges and brokers making easy reporting a priority so that their users are not left scrambling to figure out their tax situation. Meantime, I recommend educating yourself about how to secure your coins, and learning about how cryptocurrencies are regulated in your jurisdiction. If you haven’t already nailed down your 2017 cryptocurrency taxes, file a free  tax extension  (but make sure to pay your estimated taxes due to avoid late fees).  Even though cryptocurrency is still a nascent space with lots of uncertainty and some headaches – like the ones I’ve described above – I’m very hopeful about the future of the industry. Rarely does such a revolutionary tech come along and there are lots of great materials out there to learn more.

binance,Markets,Malta Proposes Test to Define When ICOs Are Securities,"The EU nation of Malta is moving closer to introducing a test that would clearly define when assets derived from initial coin offerings (ICOs) are securities. In a consultation paper  published  Friday, for which it is currently seeking public feedback, the Malta Financial Services Authority (FSA) set out a proposal for a so-called Financial Instrument Test, which would ultimately become part of its proposed Virtual Financial Asset Act (VFAA). The agency said the methodology of the test has been designed based on feedback from the its previous discussion paper,  released  in November 2017, which initially introduced the concept. According to the latest paper, the test comprises a three-stage process that would first verify whether a distributed ledger technology (DLT) asset falls under the category of ""virtual tokens"" – effectively the agency's term for what the industry calls utility tokens. The paper states: ""Virtual token is a DLT asset which has no utility, value or application outside of the DLT platform on which it was issued and that cannot be exchanged for funds on such platform or with the issuer of such DLT asset."" Tokens falling under this category would be exempted from the VFAA, according to the FSA. Assets that can be traded in a secondary market would then pass to the second phase of the test, where various securities definitions set by European financial regulators will be applied, including transferable securities, money market instruments or financial derivatives. Should a token fall under the definition of any of those assets, it would then come under the regulatory oversight of the existing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) that is enforced within the European Union financial markets. However, a negative result in stage two would lead to the third stage of the test, which would see ICO tokens regulated under the proposed VFAA. The FSA said this method would embrace a hybrid framework that adopts both existing EU regulations, as well as a national ones. Proposed to cover all ICOs organized in Malta, the paper is currently open for public input until May 5, the agency said. The developing regulatory framework in Malta comes as the island's government is seeking to embrace blockchain innovation with a well-established legal environment aimed to attract blockchain businesses to the country. Several notable cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance and OKEx, have already set up business operations in the country.

binance,Markets,"Binance, Bermuda Ink $15 Million Crypto Investment Agreement","Binance plans to set up its new global compliance center in Bermuda over the next few months, Premier David Burt has announced. Speaking at  a joint press conference  on Friday, Burt announced that a memorandum of understanding has been signed, under which the Binance Charity Foundation will put $10 million toward educational programs related to the tech. An additional $5 million will be invested in blockchain startups. On top of that, Binance will help the Bermuda government develop a regulatory framework for cryptocurrencies and blockchain, as well as establish a new office in the country. Burt said during the press conference: ""Through this partnership, Binance proposes to develop its global compliance base here in Bermuda, creating at least 40 jobs in Bermuda with at least 30 jobs for Bermudians ... [and] as soon as practical, develop a digital asset exchange in Bermuda subject to all required legal and regulatory processes, and finally, work collaboratively with the government of Bermuda and all necessary oversight agencies in the development and improvement of the robust legal and regulatory framework."" Binance CEO and founder Zhao Changpeng said Bermuda's government and regulatory bodies ""are one of the most approachable on the planet,"" and said his company would ""commit to helping the local economy."" The exchange has already begun working with a local law firm to ensure the startup's new office would be compliant with relevant laws, he added. During the press conference, Zhao also addressed the recent lawsuit filed against  Binance , noting that ""the Hong Kong high court has already rejected it and ordered Sequoia to repay our legal fees."" In his closing remarks, Burt also mentioned the new legislation Bermuda intends to pass regulating  initial coin offerings . Burt claimed that Bermuda intends to ""comprehensively govern"" initial coin offerings that are conducted within the country's borders. ""We want to ensure that Bermuda is the world's number-one place for regulation inside of this space. We have a reputation to protect,  we will protect it but we will work with all persons who we believe represents future growth for the people of this country and future opportunities and jobs,"" Burt said.

binance,Markets,Binance CEO Blasts VCs and Calls ICOs 'Necessary',"Zhao Changpeng, the CEO of popular crypto exchange Binance, said that the initial coin offering (ICO) model is preferred to venture capital – even with the risk of fraud. In a blog post published Monday  entitled  ""ICOs — Not Just 'Good-to-Have,' But Necessary,"" the  Binance  chief took aim at the VC world, notably writing that he believes ""raising money through ICOs is about 100 times easier than through traditional VCs, if not more."" It's a notable statement, considering Binance's position as one of the world's largest crypto exchanges. Nor is it perhaps surprising, given   its 2017 token sale https://www.binance.com/resources/ico/Binance_WhitePaper_en.pdf  as well as the exchange's recent spat with U.S. VC firm Sequoia. As reported previously by CoinDesk, Zhao was  sued  by Sequoia in Hong Kong for allegedly speaking to other investors while in talks about a possible capital injection to the firm. In the blog post, Zhao argued that ""a vast majority of 'professional VCs' have no clue about the projects or field they invest in."" ""Many of them have zero startup experience and don’t even have a basic understanding of the technologies involved their fields,"" Zhao went on to write. And despite admitting ICOs result in failure or outright fraud, Zhao still believes that ""compared to 'traditional VC invested projects,' a larger ratio of ICO projects will succeed."" What's more, he argued that most of those putting their money in such tokens are aware that they may not succeed in the long run. ""Most ICOs are new startup projects, and have a high rate of failure, just like in traditional startups. This is nothing new. Most ICO investors already know this. ICO investors are early adopters (and learners),"" later concluding: ""The faster movers will reap exponential benefits. Don’t get left behind.""

binance,Features,Bermuda's Blockchain Strategy Goes Beyond Just Winning New Business,"When it comes to regulating blockchain tech, bigger isn't always better – at least that's the thesis driving Bermuda's nascent regulatory efforts. ""Small ships can turn quickly. That's the beauty of Bermuda,"" Premier David Burt told CoinDesk. Bermuda is one of several small territories and microstates striving to leverage their nimble governments to attract blockchain and crypto businesses by creating regulatory certainty where other, larger governments have failed to deliver thus far.  Liechtenstein ,  Malta ,  Gibraltar  and, most recently, San Marino have joined the race alongside Bermuda, all offering proposals – and in some cases formal legislation – that promise ""comprehensive blockchain legislation."" Typically such schemes entail detailed guidance on how initial coin offering (ICO) tokens will be viewed; secondary market controls; investor and consumer protections; and anti-money laundering (AML), know your customer (KYC) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) measures. And to date, Bermuda's strategy has proved fruitful. Since launching a blockchain task force in conjunction with the Bermuda Business Development Agency (BDA) in late 2017, the government has passed legislation on ICOs and created a regulatory sandbox for those companies, put forth a Digital Asset Business Act and partnered with BitFury to shift the island's property deeds system to the blockchain. But most recently, and perhaps most notably, the U.K. territory inked a $15 million investment agreement with major crypto exchange  Binance , demonstrating that the tiny island's blockchain push is attracting real industry heavyweights. This result is one reason, Burt argues, that Bermuda stands apart from its peers. ""We have a very simple mantra in my government, and it's 'show, don't tell,'"" Burt said. But with the competition here fierce, Bermuda is attempting to diverge from other places luring crypto and blockchain startups by moving beyond regulation, and incorporating its blockchain aspirations into its own public policy agenda – including re-envisioning its youth education and immigration policies. With this, Burt said: ""We believe over the last nine months that our government has shown that not only are we open for business, but we mean business."" The old with the new Understanding Bermuda's blockchain strategy, and more importantly, what sets it apart also requires a historical view. One feature which distinguishes the island from other aspiring hubs precedes the blockchain entirely – Bermuda's multi-billion dollar insurance and reinsurance industries which have ""full regulatory equivalence"" with both the U.S. and the EU. The maturity of these industries means that there are existing robust investor protection measures and other pertinent rules that regulators have been able to build on to create the Digital Asset Business Act, explained Sean Moran, head of business development at the BDA. ""We've had to tweak them, of course, to make them appropriate and fit for purpose for this industry,"" Moran told CoinDesk, ""but we have a model that we can work from that takes all of those protections and disclosures into account, and that's what we're working from."" The dominance of Bermuda's reinsurance and insurance industries has also resulted in a burgeoning compliance-oriented sector, which Burt envisions as a critical resource for the blockchain businesses he hopes to attract. ""If you cannot meet, match the Bermuda standards, if you cannot pass our high bar, then we don't want you,"" Burt said. He explained that part of creating desirable regulatory conditions is implementing high compliance standards for companies that are made in consultation with industry players – like Binance, for example. ""That is squarely in our sweet spot,"" Wayne Caines, Bermuda's minister of national security, told CoinDesk. And that sweet spot will be especially beneficial for ICO issuers and the various stakeholders of that burgeoning industry. While industry has been waiting with baited breath for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to come out with formal guidance – since it was revealed that the regulator was closely investigating ICOs – Bermuda regulators have already set up a framework for those companies. The territory will not only require ICO issuers to scrutinize potential investors, but Bermuda itself will also scrutinize the issuers by requiring them to outline beneficial ownership structures and to create more robust white papers. According to John Narraway, an emerging technologies consultant at the BDA, this is particularly helpful since: ""The regulations around what must be in an offering document or a white paper is critical because a white paper can be something like poetry or a haiku."" He thinks this collection of standards will greatly mitigate the potential for Bermudian blockchain companies to engage in fraudulent activities. And these regulations were also based off an existing regulation, the Companies Act, that officials merely tweaked. ""We've kind of billed this as, if you will, the greenhouse off the side to start growing new things, but using the main house of structure and reputation with the success of the thing and the clarity that's going to come from that,"" John Narraway, emerging technologies consultant at the BDA said of the amendment. Yet, those leading Bermuda's blockchain efforts are also cognizant of the industry's proclivity for rapid change, and believe their regulations are prepared to accommodate it. ""Think of it like software versioning,"" Narraway suggested. ""We know it's not going to be 100 percent perfect, but it's going to be as best as it possibly can be. If we can go from whiteboard to legislation in two months, how long is it going to take us to issue a 'patch' – to use software terminology?"" He added: ""We're going to have [version] 1.1 probably pretty quickly because we're going to be listening to the industry."" Involving the locals Likewise, another means by which the government plans to keep pace with the industry is by keeping communication lines open with the major industry players, and making sure to keep the island's citizens in mind. For instance, the memorandum of understanding between Bermuda and Binance stipulates that the crypto exchange will not only move its compliance center to the island, but also invest $10 million into blockchain-related educational programs and $5 million in blockchain startups over the course of two to three years. In return, Bermuda will work to provide a steady talent pool for the company. ""We want to do it because we want those players and others to come into the market and create economic activity,"" Burt said of the deal. Echoing Burt, Narraway said, the arrival of such companies can bring Bermuda up to speed with the industry by converting and capitalizing on local talent, and ideally abet the island's ""brain drain,"" whereby highly-skilled locals move to other places where the market for such talent is more competitive. ""We want to be able to pull [young people] back in and give them opportunities, real opportunities, to participate in the economy and to grow it and to develop their careers,"" Narraway said. According to Burt, the Bermudian government is in talks with other heavyweights from ""the entire space,"" though he declined to identify them. The officials plan to release further information on industry partners and legislation in upcoming weeks. Narraway thinks local startups also stand to benefit, particularly because the industry presents new possibilities for raising early stage capital, which is in short supply on the island. ""I can tell you from the business development side, we're having meetings every week with companies that are saying, 'I think I'm going to do this startup, this is where I want to go,' and now they're saying, 'explain to me this ICO as an option for doing my first round of funding,"" he said. Narraway concluded: ""So I think this is a huge opportunity for the local companies and local entrepreneurs in Bermuda.""

binance,Markets,Malta Passes Trio of Bills as Part of 'Blockchain Island' Plan,"Malta has taken a significant step toward becoming a ""Blockchain Island."" Announced Tuesday by Silvio Schembri – a Maltese Member of Parliament and the parliamentary secretary responsible for financial services, digital economy and innovation – the island nation's parliament has passed three bills regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) marking it as one of the first jurisdictions in the world to pass specific legislation around the tech. Calling the news a ""world first,"" Schembri, who introduced all three bills to parliament, tweeted: The three bills –numbered  43 ,  44 ,  45  – are titled ""The Innovative Technology Arrangements and Services Act,"" ""The Virtual Financial Assets Act,"" and ""The Malta Digital Innovation Authority Act,"" respectively. With the bills now passed, they are expected to help guide the Maltese government on how to better embrace blockchain and achieve its aim of becoming an international crypto business hub. Bill 45, for example, will see the creation of the Malta Digital Innovation Authority, which will primarily be in charge of promoting and developing the blockchain industry in Malta, according to  public documents . The measures also provide for the regulation of initial coin offerings and set out the regulatory powers of the Digital Innovation Authority within the space. In his tweet, Schembri also revealed that Stephen McCarthy – formerly CEO of the country's Housing Authority – has been appointed the chief executive of the new authority. As CoinDesk has  reported  previously, this microstate's government is known for its friendly attitude toward blockchain technology, which has already drawn many crypto businesses – including big-name exchanges like Binance and OKEx – to set up shop in the country.

Binance, the largest exchange by volume according to CoinMarketCap, announced Thursday that it was starting a fiat-crypto trading pair with the Uganda shilling. Moreover, the company also announced its first fiat crypto exchange in the nation, called Binance Uganda, according to a  statement . The exchange will charge zero trading fees when it comes online, though Binance declined to state when that would be. However, the first 20,000 users to register with the service will receive 0.5 binance coins (BNB) as ""appreciation"" for their support, according to the statement. The tokens will be distributed on a first-come, first-serve basis but users who wish to withdraw their tokens must complete identification verification procedures after the platform is launched, according to the announcement. The launch marks Binance's latest steps in expanding cryptocurrency trading in the underbanked country. Only 33 percent of Ugandans actively use their registered financial accounts in 2016, according to a study by   Financial Inclusion Insights http://finclusion.org/uploads/file/reports/Uganda%20Wave%204%20Report_20-June-2017.pdf , a data-collection organization which focuses on trends in the digital financial services industry. The Hong Kong-based exchange also has announced plans to open a fiat-crypto trading platform in Malta, an island nation located in the Central Mediterranean Sea,  Bloomberg  reported.

binance,Markets,China Seeks to Block Access to 124 Foreign Crypto Exchanges,"Chinese regulators are moving to block more than 100 overseas crypto exchanges from offering trading services to domestic investors. Shanghai Securities Times, a mouthpiece of the Chinese financial authorities,  reported  on Thursday that the China National Fintech Risk Rectification Office has so far identified 124 trading platforms with overseas IP addresses but that are still available in the country. The office now plans to step up its efforts in monitoring commercial use of cryptocurrency and to block internet access to these trading platforms, the report said. Authorized in 2016 by China's State Council, the National Fintech Risk Rectification Office is a government agency that aims to protect against financial risk related to issues like peer-to-peer lending and cryptocurrency trading. In September 2017, the People's Bank of China notably announced a rule banning initial coin offerings (ICOs) and, in effect, crypto trading platforms in the country. Following the notice, major exchanges based in China moved their businesses overseas. Currently, internet access to several major exchanges such as  Binance ,  OKEx , and  Bitfinex  appears to be unavailable in China. Today's report also said the agency will permanently shut down domestic websites and official accounts on the WeChat messaging app if they are found to be providing crypto trading and ICO services. The agency is also in talks with third-party payments vendors that are required to scrutinize and halt accounts that are suspected of handling cryptocurrency transactions, the report added. Just two days ago, several Chinese cryptocurrency media outlets were banned from operating on WeChat, as reported by CoinDesk. WeChat's owner Tencent  confirmed  with news source Caixin on Wednesday that the ban was instigated because the accounts were found to have provided crypto trading and ICO services. Some of them were ordered to shut down permanently, the report said.

binance,Markets,Malta's Prime Minister Hails Crypto as 'Future of Money' in UN Speech,"Malta's prime minister, Joseph Muscat, has used his platform at the U.N. to speak out on the potential of blockchain and cryptocurrency, calling them an ""inevitable"" part of a digital future. In a speech at the general debate of the 73rd Session of the General Assembly of the U.N. on Sept. 27, Muscat raised Malta's move to set up as a ""Blockchain Island"" and  said  that the nation is the ""first jurisdiction worldwide"" to regulate the technology that ""previously existed in a legal vacuum."" As reported by CoinDesk, Malta's parliament  passed three bills  regarding cryptocurrencies, blockchain and distributed ledger technology (DLT) back in June. Since then a number of cryptocurrency-focused firms including the Binance exchange have moved to set up business entities on the island, with some  agreeing partnerships  with Malta's stock exchange. In his speech, which had previously addressed issues such as immigration, Muscat continued to take a bullish tone on the technology, saying: ""Blockchain makes cryptocurrencies the inevitable future of money, more transparent since it helps filter good businesses from bad businesses."" Not only that, the PM concluded, distributed ledger technology also has the potential to give patients ""real ownership"" of their medical records, it can ""verify that humanitarian assistance is reaching it's intended destination,"" and it helps bring more accountability to corporations and governments. While the country has taken the lead to regulate blockchain and cryptocurrency, other jurisdictions are also moving towards setting up frameworks governing firms using the tech, but aimed not to stifle business or innovation. Bermuda , for example, is also hoping to draw more companies to the island by providing regulatory certainty with  new legislation  that would allow initial coin offerings under certain conditions. It has also set up a  task force  to foster cryptocurrency commerce. There have also been moves  within the EU  to develop new rules for cryptos, with one lawmaker also proposing  standards for ICOs  that would allow token sale projects to operate across the economic zone.

binance,Markets,Binance Releases Demo of Planned Decentralized Crypto Exchange,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by adjusted trading volume, has released a new video demo of its decentralized exchange, dubbed Binance DEX, ahead of its launch in early 2019. Released Wednesday, the  video  demonstrates the trading interface of Binance DEX, along with a web crypto wallet and the explorer for Binance's native public blockchain, Binance Chain, which the firm says will be made available on a testnet soon. Based on the video, Binance DEX will have a very similar interface to its existing centralized exchange, with some additional features. For example, it includes an option to generate a 24-word mnemonic seed phrase for users' private keys, a ""balances tab"" to inform users of the status of their accounts and a ""user icon"" in the navigation bar that shows individual wallet addresses. With the blockchain explorer, users can search for an individual block and view transactions included in a particular block, the demo explains. ""User funds on the DEX will be secured with decentralized wallet applications like Trust Wallet, which has a server-free infrastructure that stores private keys only on the user’s device, meaning only users have access to their funds,"" Binance said in a statement on Wednesday. Binance DEX is built on its own Binance Chain, which was first  unveiled  in March of this year and is aimed to offer ""low latency, high throughput trading, as well as decentralized custody of funds."" With the DEX, traders will be able to send and receive Binance's own BNB tokens and other coins via trading pairs, Binance said, adding that while BNB is currently an ERC-20 token, it will soon be migrated to Binance Chain upon its mainnet launch. The first video demo of Binance DEX was  released   in August, which outlined via a command line interface the basics of issuing, listing and trading crypto assets. In June, Singapore-based cryptocurrency exchange Huobi also  announced  a plan to evolve into a standalone decentralized exchange, offering funding for developer assistance in creating an open-sourced blockchain protocol.

binance,Features,What to Know About Tron's BitTorrent Token Airdrop This Week,"The first thing to know about the BitTorrent Token (BTT) airdrop is that it's not just a one-off event. This first one begins a series of monthly airdrops that will run until February 2025. There are 990 billion BTT tokens created on the Tron blockchain. Of those, 10.1 percent have been designated for  airdrops  to TRX holders over the next six years, starting on Monday. Furthermore, the monthly airdrop will get bigger as time goes on, increasing once every February. ""Think of Tron and BitTorrent like a razor and a blade,"" Justin Sun, founder of Tron and CEO of BitTorrent, told CoinDesk via a spokesperson. ""You need both together to create a new internet economy driven by decentralization. We are seeding BTT to deliver a marketplace of innovations and applications across the web."" When the Tron blockchain reaches a block height of 6.6 million, the team will take a snapshot of TRX balances and split up the first airdrop proportionally to all TRX holders. The first 12 airdrops will each distribute 990 million BTT tokens. Holders of one TRX will receive 0.11 BTT next week, according to Binance. Currently ranked the eighth largest blockchain by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, Tron is  currently worth $1.75 billion  as of this writing. That's down in value compared to when the ERC-20 version of  TRX migrated  to Tron's standalone blockchain, which then stood at $3 billion. Last June,  Tron acquired BitTorrent , one of the oldest decentralized protocols on the internet. Then it announced it would create  a new token  called BTT for use with its file-sharing services. The public sale for that token sold out  almost instantly , much like  early sales  during the initial coin offering (ICO) craze. Is BTT safu? Though Binance has been communicating all the information about the BTT distribution, users don't need to hold their tokens on the exchange to receive the free tokens. Two wallets that were featured  at niTROn Summit 2019  have confirmed that their users are all set to receive airdrops of TRC-10 tokens (the standard used to create BTT). Tron Wallet and Trust Wallet have both confirmed that they are ready to support the airdrop, as have exchanges Binance, OKEx and Huobi. ""We support TRX, TRC-10 tokens, and if you control your keys, you will get an airdrop of BTT,"" Viktor Radchenko of Trust Wallet confirmed to CoinDesk over Telegram. We previously spoke to Rachenko when non-fungible tokens were  the hot topic in crypto . ""There's not anything left to do,"" Fred Terenas, who runs business development for Tron Wallet, told CoinDesk, adding that his team is still getting that question endlessly. Terenas has noticed one action advanced users are taking to get ready. With the forthcoming initial BTT airdrop, he said, holders of other TRC-10 tokens are moving to TRX to get the free BTT. ""Some people go out and get rid of whatever they have to get the airdrop,"" he said. This has led to short-term price drops for TRC-10 tokens, though Terenas expects many users to return to their original holdings after they receive some BTT. Planned chaos This dynamic, however, could play out each month. Such movements to and from TRX will make for an interesting ongoing experiment. With its long airdrop plan for BTT, Sun's Tron has positioned TRX as the proverbial gift that keeps on giving. The total monthly airdrop will increase five times over the next few years, ending at 1,402,500,000 BTT per month in February 2025. That said, if this is a strategy by Tron to encourage its supporters to HODL, Turing Advisory's token economics expert, Sid Kalla, doesn't see it working. ""In general, the price of a token can drop much more than what the airdrops are worth,"" he said, ""so this should not be seen as a 'long-term hold' strategy for TRX holders, going by the history of airdrops in the space."" Kalla does foresee advantages for Tron's partner, Binance, however. ""One thing that jumps out is the set date on which the balances are eligible for the airdrop. This is bound to increase volatility and trading volume around this date, which is likely good for Binance,"" Kalla noted, while acknowledging he couldn't be sure: ""There is not too much precedent here with a long airdrop."" Binance did not reply to a request for comment. Justin Sun speaks at niTROn Summit 2019 in San Francisco.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: EOS, Ethereum, Bitcoin Cash, Binance Coin, Stellar ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. After a prolonged downward trend, most of the major cryptocurrencies are showing gains on a weekly basis. This shows that the recovery is picking up steam. However, even after the recent rise, most tokens are still way below their lifetime highs. Cryptocurrencies will have to spend a long time forming large bases, upon which the next bull phase will be built. It is too early to call a bottom. A bear market is a great time for the investors to pick up the best coins at a bargain. Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit, has said that the current bear market has driven away all the  speculators , leaving behind only the true crypto believers. That is a bullish sign because the die-hard crypto enthusiasts buy for the long term and will not panic sell on the next 30 percent fall. After a new uptrend begins, new traders will start jumping in. The entry of institutional investors and the approval of a crypto exchange-traded fund (ETF) can provide a big boost to the crypto prices. Once an ETF is approved in the United States, other  nations  might follow suit. EOS/USD EOS  has been on a roll and has emerged as the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies, rising by about 35 percent in the past seven days. The EOS community seems to have been satisfied with the assurance of block.one CEO Brendan Blumer, who has posted in the cryptocurrency’s official Telegram channel that “great things take time.” In his message, Blumer also said that he does not want to take what he called the short-sighted approach and push half-finished products out. Is this attitude good enough to carry the cryptocurrency higher, or is the rally about to hit a roadblock? Let’s find out.   The  EOS/USD  pair is attempting to rise above the overhead resistance of $3.8723. If successful, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Therefore, the medium-term investors can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $3.8723, and keep a stop loss below the strong support of $2.1733. If the price sustains above $3.8723, it could move up to $6.8299. Although there is a minor resistance at $4.4930, we expect it to be crossed. If the momentum remains strong, the pullback could even reach $9.30. Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has moved up towards the midpoint. This shows that bottom formation is in progress. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels, or from $4.4930, and breaks below $1.55. ETH/USD The week saw some heated discussions among the Ethereum ( ETH ) community which led to Afri Schoeden, release manager at blockchain infrastructure firm Parity Technologies,  quitting  all Ethereum projects. The United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) has largely received positive  comments  regarding the Ethereum mechanism. Will this open the door to a regulated futures contract on Ethereum? Let’s keep our fingers crossed.     The  ETH/USD  pair has been moving up for the past two weeks. It has risen from $103.2 to the current levels during this period. The 20-week EMA is flattening out, and the RSI is gradually climbing towards the midpoint. This shows that the bears are losing their grip. A breakout above $167.32 will indicate strength and confirm a bottom at $83. Therefore, traders can buy on a weekly close (UTC time frame) above $167.32 and keep a stop loss of $100. If the price fails to sustain the higher levels after the breakout and dips below the breakout level again, it will denote weakness and the positions can be closed. If the cryptocurrency sustains above $167.32, it can move up to $225, and above it to $255. Traders can trail the stop loss higher as the price moves northwards. BCH/USD Coinbase will release a new wallet update over the next few weeks that will  support  Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ). Major Malta-based cryptocurrency exchange OKEx has  added  Bitcoin Cash support to its customer-to-customer (C2C) trading platform. Traders can now buy Bitcoin Cash with one of the five fiat currencies supported by the platform. What do the charts forecast for the next few weeks? In the medium term, we don’t see any major bullish signals yet. Although the bulls are attempting to form a higher low at $105, it will take some time before we can confirm the start of a new uptrend. A breakout above $239 will be the first step that will confirm that the bottom has been formed at $73.5. The 20-week EMA is also located just above $239. Hence, this is likely to act as a major hurdle. Once crossed, the  BCH/USD  pair will pick up momentum. The next overhead resistance is way higher, closer to $600. Although short-term traders can try to stay on the long side for some quick profits, the medium-term traders should wait for a confirmation of a bottom before buying. BNB/USD Binance launched the testnet of its new decentralized exchange, Binance DEX, on Feb. 20. With this, the company aims to offer its customers the best features of the Binance exchange in a  decentralized  setting. Binance academy has risen to the  third  spot on the exposure platform Product Hunt. Binance Charity Foundation (BCF) has launched a lunch-based program in Uganda, where about 200 students and school staff will be given two meals in 2019. Binance  Coin (BNB) has regularly been featured on our list of top crypto performers. Can this continue? The  BNB/USD  pair is showing strength. It easily broke above the resistance at $10 and is currently facing resistance at $12. This zone had proven to be a major hurdle previously, so we anticipate a minor dip or a consolidation in the next few days. Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, which shows that the bulls are back in the game. A break out of $12 could push the price to $15, and above it to $18, while a turn around from the current levels will find support close to $8. Although we have been bullish on the pair for the past few weeks, we were unable to spot a reliable pattern or a good stop loss point. Because of that, we are not suggesting a trade in the coin. XLM/USD Head of Blockchain Development & Digital Currencies at IBM, Jesse Lund, has hinted at a new partnership with Stellar ( XLM ), which has boosted the cryptocurrency’s prices. Can this news change the fortunes of the coin? Let’s find out. While most other cryptocurrencies are well above their recent lows, the  XLM/USD  pair continues to languish near its own. If the bulls push the price above $0.09285498, the recovery could extend to $0.13427050. The 20-week EMA is also located just above this level, so it might act as a major roadblock. Both of the moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is still in the negative zone. Also, the cryptocurrency has been a major underperformer in the current pullback.

binance,Markets,Binance Dangles $100K in Crypto to Get Users to Test Its DEX,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance is hoping to boost the number of people testing its upcoming decentralized exchange (DEX) platform by giving away $100,000 in tokens. Announcing the news on  Twitter  on Friday, Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao said: ""To test the hell out of @Binance_DEX, we are giving away roughly $100,000 USD equivalent, in REAL $BNB, as reward for our testnet trading competition."" The initiative, he said, would help the exchange launch the mainnet, or live version, of Binance DEX more quickly. According to Binance's website, the funds will be made available as prizes in a  simulated trading competition  kicking off next Thursday. Exchange users who hold at least one Binance Coin token (BNB) in their account will be eligible to participate in the event. Each account can register up to 20 Binance Chain addresses and will receive 200 virtual BNB tokens for each address to use as starting funds for the competition. The firm noted that the Binance Chain testnet will be reset before 08:00 UTC on March 7, clearing all existing asset balances. Once complete, trading for the competition will commence. Two contests Binance is dividing the competition into two different events, with prizes in BNB for each. Firstly, there's the ""Token Competition for Healthy Price Volatility,"" which will see users compete to issue and list tokens on the testnet. ""The addresses that own tokens will be ranked in terms of the sum of each token price’s volatility over every five-minute interval on the 'Token'/BNB trading pair during the competition period,"" the exchange says. There are three prizes up for grabs, ranging from 1,000–3,000 BNB. Secondly, there an ""Absolute Return Competition"" event that will be ranked according to the absolute returns users achieve with their trading strategies on specific tokens. This one offers 20 prizes ranging from 50–1,000 BNB. The BNB token is trading at just over $11 at press time, according to CoinMarketCap  data . Binance  announced  on Feb. 20 that the DEX was open for public testing, allowing users to create wallets and interact with the trading platform’s interface. At the same time, it revealed a blockchain explorer for the testnet of its Binance Chain network, which supports the DEX.

binance,Opinion,The Unbelievable Brilliance of Binance,"Pete Rizzo is editor in chief for CoinDesk. Whatever people make of the cryptocurrency exchange  Binance  and its leader,  Changpeng Zhao , the company's success isn't just unprecedented, it's precedent-setting. Binance, I would argue, is emerging as the case study for growing a cryptocurrency business, a success that’s much needed in a community that spends too much time talking up the potential of its technology and too little time analyzing viable go-to-market strategies that can drive the technological sea change we foresee. In that regard, I think the market is only just beginning to understand just how visionary Binance is and what its success – in terms of market timing and product impact – says about something we all are striving to find: a model for building scalable and impactful cryptocurrency businesses. Indeed, at a time when many cryptocurrency startups are going through pivots and layoffs, Binance feels as if it's hitting its stride, offering a deeper level of new, innovative products that are moving the industry forward in just the right ways at just the right times. It's a feat made more complex by the boom-bust nature of the cryptocurrency market, in which opportunities for user growth come and go quick and wherein the great majority of cryptocurrency startups overthink execution and fail to adapt thereafter. But after observing Binance for over a year now, it's clear there's no business that has been as deliberate in taking advantage of the cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market and its ebbs and flows. Binance has only been around since 2017, but it has evolved significantly in its short life, in ways that show the impeccable thinking of its company and leadership. Over the past 12 months, Binance has expertly shifted through three stages: It delivered tested technology – a working crypto-to-crypto exchange offering buying and selling services in all but 15 countries – at a time when market conditions made it possible to massively capture users. As the market downturn began, and other exchanges lost momentum, it shifted to incentivizing users to adopt value-adding products, such as  Binance LaunchPad , which propels the sale of new cryptocurrencies directly through its exchange. Now, with its investments in its forthcoming  decentralized exchange , it may well be poised to disrupt itself in ways that further legitimize the cryptocurrency industry. Buckets Of Rain Focusing on this last idea, it's safe to say now that in the world of cryptocurrencies, there are two seasons: drought and monsoon. I like this analogy because it implies its logic viscerally. There are times when acquiring new users (rain) is relatively easy (and when spending capital to acquire new, novice users is advantageous), and there are times (drought) when doing so is fruitless (when the costs of acquiring those users are prohibitively high). In the case of Binance, its launch time – in the middle of the summer 2017 boom – couldn't have been better. As the rising tide would lift all boats, it perhaps obfuscated what actually occurred. A seasoned industry veteran – CZ cut his teeth working at Blockchain and OKCoin, two early cryptocurrency success stories that later succumbed to fatigue – read the tea leaves, and executed a deft go-to-market strategy. Because CZ had spent years building trading systems (in crypto and externally), he was able to raise money via an ICO and deploy a battle-tested technology into an environment hungry for alternative assets (at a time when most exchanges were constrained by U.S.-dollar trading and the regulation in brought). Here CZ made two decisions whose brilliance is only now becoming apparent. One, he chose not to allow trading in fiat currencies, thus sidestepping the regulatory issues inherent with government currencies. And two, he built a team that could and did supply the infrastructure necessary to serve the obvious market demand (by quickly and capably adding new crypto markets). By rapidly adding to the choice of crypto assets that its clients could invest in, Binance scaled to 3 million users in just six months. An antithesis can be found in Coinbase’s business model. While the San Francisco exchange’s overall user growth was more impressive than Binance’s (they topped 20 million users in 2017), one can't as easily argue that they evolved the business as well. Coinbase spent most of the 2017 bubble selling only a handful of assets (four in total), and benefiting from its position as the easiest fiat on-ramp for consumers. It wasn’t until 2018, when the entrance of new users had drastically slowed, that it began launching new assets, though this was largely amidst a period of waning consumer interest. The end result was that, during the last cycle, Coinbase was essentially an onboarding platform for Binance, meaning users who started at Coinbase and other fiat exchanges were quickly forced, by virtue of its limited asset supply, to look for services elsewhere. There were few other options and even fewer teams that executed as well. The Miraculous BNB But if it was heretical not to enable trading in U.S. dollars, CZ didn't just stop there. Another aspect he seemed to implicitly understand was that since competitors could easily replicate his strategy of offering many cryptocurrencies, he would need built-in incentives to keep users on the exchange. Enter: Binance Coin. Binance Coin (BNB) seemed like an excuse for an ICO at the time, but it's since been revealed to be a brilliant way to encourage repeat business. By offering traders a way to speculate on a token that floated on a public market, and by enabling the exchange’s fees to be paid in that coin, Binance seems to have created a virtuous cycle by which its users were incentivized to stay within its platform. Binance Coin now has an insanely large market cap of $2.3 billion, a number that has been  growing a-cyclically in a down market ). (Note: This is not an argument so much for the present valuation of BNB, nor an analysis of what that can or should be, but an acknowledgement that Binance Coin is an innovation that the market should and is in the process of valuing). Not content to rest on those laurels, Binance has  created a network of additional products around BNB coin, such as ""LaunchPad,"" a service that conducts ICOs payable in BNB, thus further extending and incentivizing its ecosystem. (If you don't think this is impressive, again, remind yourself this is a company that, despite its now 300+ employees, hasn't lost its timing). With incentives so well aligned, other exchanges have been rushing to replicate the model,  including Huobi , OKcoin and a slew of other smaller exchanges. That this is likely to become a staple of the exchange business model seems like a foregone conclusion. Could there seriously be a crypto exchange business that isn't studying what has been created here and thinking about what it means for their business? I doubt it, as the need for such solutions can be seen across the exchange sector. Kraken, for example, raised its recent $100 million funding round largely from its users, the logic being that those who invest in its future will be more likely to stay, thus providing liquidity, product feedback and other valuable input. The message is clear – cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the largest and most profitable businesses in the industry have a big problem for which they're willing to consider any and all manner of solutions for, retaining users. Binance, it seems, not only anticipated the problem, but already has a solution. An Ambitious Future So, what's next for the exchange? Will it rest on its laurels until IPO? It doesn't seem so. Binance appears set to soon launch a  fiat-to-crypto gateway in Singapore , a move that would bring it, finally, under an influential regulator's purview. It's the kind of success you'd expect a CEO to tout on Twitter, right? But bending to convention doesn't seem to be top of mind for CZ these days. In potentially the most dramatic pivot, Binance is working rapidly toward deploying a decentralized exchange, the Binance DEX, having already put it on testnet in February. Decentralized exchanges, in which users would be able to trade cryptocurrencies peer-to-peer through a blockchain protocol – without the backing of a single service provider like Binance, are cutting-edge technology. None have been deployed at scale, and it remains to be seen what challenges lie ahead in their execution. That Binance has embraced his direction, though, should give the market pause – it stands in sharp contrast to those being made by other major exchanges. At a time when most appear to be adding old guard Wall Street professionals and taking on VC money with the intent on courting institutional money, Binance, it seems, sees a bigger prize in successfully building the next-generation version of the kind of product it originally created – cutting-edge tech that can massively scale for global retail consumption. Critically, Binance's lack of VC funding and the freedom that affords means it is better placed than probably any other company to take its embrace of a decentralized exchange to its natural but extreme conclusion: handing over its operation completely to users of the BNB network. In disrupting itself, Binance could even end up being something even more innovative than an exchange (decentralized or not) – a viable, crypto-native exit strategy. If that's the case, the Binance story could even one day offer an alternative to the Silicon Valley narrative that companies should foster user growth only to pursue a conventional exit by going public. Is all of this an over-read of Binance? Perhaps. But after the company has amassed such a track record, there's maybe only one question left – who, exactly, is betting against Binance?

binance, News , Research: Cryptocurrency Exchange Binance Registered 66% Profit Increase in Q1 2019 ,"Major  cryptocurrency exchange   Binance  reported $78 million in profits in Q1 2019, up 66% compared to the previous quarter,  cryptocurrency  news outlet The Block  reports  on April 16. The claims have been extrapolated by The Block from Binance’s seventh quarterly binance coin ( BNB ) burn  data . Per the report, the 830,000 BNB burned represent 20% of the exchange’s net profits in the first quarter of this year. The Block notes that this allows for easy deduction of the company’s profits, even though Binance does not release financial reports. The report also notes that in Q4 of last year, the company received about $47 million in net profit. Binance Coin is currently the seventh-biggest cryptocurrency by market cap, according to CoinMarketCap  data , and reported a loss of nearly one and a half of a percent on the day to press time. According to a  post  on Binance’s blog, the company has burned 5.82% of the total BNB supply so far.

binance, News , Binance Updates White Paper to Reword Section on Quarterly Manipulations with BNB ,"Binance  has recently updated its white paper’s section devoted to quarterly manipulations with its native  token  binance coin (BNB), based on a  version  of the white paper backed up on the Internet Archive Wayback Machine on Feb. 8. 
 According to the section “Repurchasing plan” in the older version, Binance stated that they would buy back BNB each quarter using 20% of their profits, and then destroy them until the exchange buys 50% of all 100 million BNB back. 
 In the  new version  of the white paper, Binance has replaced “Repurchasing plan” with “The Burn” section, explaining that every quarter, the exchange will destroy BNB based on the trading volume on its crypto-to-crypto platform until it destroys 50% of all the BNB. 
 Both versions conclude that the exchange will eventually destroy 100 million BNB, leaving 100 million BNB remaining. 
 The older version of Binance’s white paper was captured on Wayback Machine on Feb. 8, while the newer version appeared in the archive on March 31. 
 
 Binance’s older white paper version vs. updated version. Source:  Binance 
 Binance BNB’s description on its  website  has remained  unchanged  at press time since November 2018, stating that Binance “plans to use 20% of its profits each quarter buy back and burn BNB, until 50% of the total BNB supply (100 million BNB) is burned.” 
 As a Binance spokesperson told crypto news outlet  The Block Crypto , Binance will still burn 20% of profits within the process described in the new version of the white paper. 
 Addressing the change, Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao confirmed the news to The Block Crypto, claiming that the rewording was made to clarify that the exchange does not repurchase any BNB, but simply reduces the supply by burning the tokens. He said: 
 “We recently updated our whitepaper to better describe how we actually conduct the burn. For example, we removed the buy back reference because we actually don’t repurchase BNB and simply reduce the supply by burning BNB. We also removed the profit language because some regions tend to associate profits with securities, and we would like to distance BNB from that. So going forward, we plan to describe the burn this way, and burn what we burn.” 
 Yesterday, Binance  launched  its mainnet Binance Chain in beta testing mode for selected partners, also announcing that the exchange plans to execute the swap of its native token BNB on April 23. After that date, Binance will not support the withdrawal of  ERC-20  BNB tokens, as the exchange plans to convert ERC-20 BNB tokens into native Binance Chain-based BNB (BEP2) coins.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-updates-white-paper-to-reword-section-on-quarterly-manipulations-with-bnb,cointelegraph,2019-04-19,00:00:00,en,428,2606,5.0,154,0.3598130841121495,binance recently updated paper section devoted manipulation native token binance coin bnb based version paper backed internet archive wayback machine section repurchasing plan older version binance stated buy bnb profit destroy exchange buy bnb version paper binance replaced repurchasing plan burn section explaining exchange destroy bnb based trading volume crypto crypto platform destroys bnb version conclude exchange eventually destroy bnb leaving bnb remaining older version binance paper captured wayback machine newer version appeared archive binance older paper version updated version source binance binance bnb description website remained unchanged press time stating binance plan profit buy burn bnb total bnb supply bnb burned binance spokesperson told crypto news outlet crypto binance burn profit process version paper addressing change binance ceo changpeng cz confirmed news crypto claiming rewording made clarify exchange repurchase bnb simply reduces supply burning token recently updated whitepaper describe conduct burn removed buy reference repurchase bnb simply reduce supply burning bnb removed profit language region tend associate profit security distance bnb forward plan describe burn burn burn yesterday binance launched mainnet binance chain beta testing mode selected partner announcing exchange plan execute swap native token bnb binance support withdrawal erc bnb token exchange plan convert erc bnb token native binance chain based bnb bep coin,0.024999999999999994,positive,0.33035714285714285,"{'neg': 0.07, 'neu': 0.818, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.6908}",0.6908,0.07,0.818,0.112,positive,-0.16666665277777895,0.06249999967447917,negative
binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers Overview: XTZ, BNB, BCH, ETH, XMR ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. An extended downtrend usually goes through an accumulation phase before starting a new uptrend. Digital assets fund Adamant Capital  believes  that the crypto markets are currently going through that phase. Currently, about 3% of American retirees have invested in Bitcoin, according to a recent survey.  56.7%  of the retirees have heard of Bitcoin, but are reluctant to invest. This might be due to the long and crushing bear market. When the markets start rising and enter a bull phase, many of these are likely to enter the markets. Clarity on regulations from the government will also result in greater participation. Andrew Yang — a United States Democratic presidential candidate for the 2020 elections — is in favor of implementing clear  regulations  on digital assets. The Chinese President Xi Jinping is bullish on the prospects of the blockchain technology for the future. Though cryptocurrency trading is banned in China, the ruling party sees the renminbi as a  cryptocurrency  in about 20 years, according to Donald Tapscott, executive chairman of the Blockchain Research Institute. However, how much support a centralized cryptocurrency launched by a central bank will receive in the community is yet to be seen. XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The market participants cheered the comments by French finance minister Bruno Le Maire on Tezos and the blockchain industry. In an interview to French magazine  Capital , the minister  said  that France is looking to invest over $4.5 billion euros in innovative industries, including blockchain, in the next five years. Is Tezos worth a buy even now or will it enter a correction? Let’s find out. The  XTZ/USD  pair has seen a strong pullback from the lows. From a low of $0.33, it has risen to the current levels, which is a rise of over 300%. It is presently trying to break out of the overhead resistance of $1.295480, but is facing resistance close to the 50-week SMA. The 20-week SMA has started to slope up and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. We anticipate a stiff resistance between the 50-week SMA and $1.85. After the sharp recovery from the lows, we anticipate a minor correction or consolidation. However, if the momentum pushes the price above $1.85, the rally can reach $2.75 and above it to $4.20. After a sharp run-up, it is always better to wait and enter on a consolidation or a minor dip. BNB/USD Analysis by the Binance research team concluded that  the crypto winter  might be coming to an end. We believe the resurgence is being led by binance coin ( BNB ), which is the best performer among major cryptocurrencies and might become the first to scale the highs made during the bull run in January of last year. Crypto exchange Binance earned  $78 million  in profits in Q1 2019, a growth of 66% over the comparable quarter of the previous year. Binance CFO Wei Zhou said that the profits were  boosted  by the surge in OTC trades. The exchange has launched its mainnet and plans to execute the swap of binance coin on  April 23 . Also this week, Binance has started a campaign to  support  the reconstruction of the Notre Dame Cathedral. The  BNB/USD  pair is on fire: it is close to breaking the previous high of $26.4732350 made in early January of 2018. This is a major sentiment booster as it gives confidence to the traders that the best is yet to come for the cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals. As the pair moved up, it picked up momentum. While this is a bullish sign, it has also pushed the weekly RSI into deeply overbought zone. This increases the possibility of a minor correction or consolidation; however, it is difficult to time it. When the momentum is strong, overbought markets can become even more overbought. While the investors holding the cryptocurrency can stay put with an appropriate stop loss, it might be dicey to take a new position at the current levels, as the risk to reward ratio is not attractive. BCH/USD Bitcoin cash ( BCH ) was the main beneficiary of bitcoin SV’s delisting by  major  crypto  exchanges  this week. In another move,  SBI Holdings  has conversely said that it will delist bitcoin cash from its exchange in June 2019. The company has stated that the decision to  delist  bitcoin cash was premeditated, and had nothing to do with its partnership with nChain (whose chief scientist, Craig Wright, is the founder of BSV). The  BCH/USD  pair had surged the week before. After the sharp move, the previous week saw mild correction. This week, the pair is again attempting to break out of the overhead resistance at $363.30. If successful, it can move up to $451.32. The 50-week SMA is close to this level; hence, this might act as a resistance. But if the bulls breakout of this resistance zone, a rally to $600 can be on the cards. Meanwhile, the 20-week EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the center. This points to a consolidation for a few more weeks. However, if the bears sink the digital currency below the support zone of $255 and the 20-week EMA, a fall to $166.25 is probable. ETH/USD Cryptocurrency exchange Coincheck has  added  ether ( ETH ) to its over-the-counter offering. Ethereum core developers are  debating  whether more frequent and smaller hard forks are better than the larger and less frequent hard forks. The decentralized platform needs to be on its toes to ward off the increasing competition. The  ETH/USD  pair is facing a stiff tussle between the bears and the bulls at the critical $167.32 level. While the bulls scaled this level in the week before, completing an ascending triangle pattern, they could not build up on the gains. Last week, the bears attempted to sink the pair back into the triangle. This week, the bulls are again trying to keep the price above $167.32. If the bulls succeed in pushing the price above $187.98, the digital currency can rally to its target objective of $251.64. On the other hand, a breakdown of $167.32 and the 20-week EMA will turn the tables in favor of the bears. The next couple of weeks are critical for the cryptocurrency, as it will determine the next directional move. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) celebrated its  fifth  anniversary this week with a slew of events. Can the fifth best performer of the past week better its performance in the coming weeks? Let’s find out. The  XMR/USD  pair has been sustaining above the breakout level of $60.147 and the 20-week EMA for the past two weeks. This is a positive sign and it increases the possibility of a breakout above $81. If the bulls sustain the price above $81, it can gradually move up to $114.840, and above it to $128.650. The medium-term target is $150. On the other hand, if the price fails to scale above the overhead resistance, it can remain range bound between $60.147 and $81 for a few weeks. The pair will weaken if the bears sink the price below $60.147. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.

binance, News ," Neo 3.0 to Launch on New Blockchain Network, Users Will Need to Swap Tokens ","Neo  3.0 is going to be launched as a new  blockchain  network and users will need to swap their existing tokens for new ones, according to an official announcement shared with Cointelegraph on April 29. The Chinese platform’s co-founder and core developer Erik Zhang has said the new chain, which is coming from a new genesis block, is necessary because several architectural improvements to Neo’s performance and stability are not compatible with its current blockchain. According to the platform, all data and transaction records will migrate to Neo 3.0, and concurrent development branches will be in place before the mainnet’s launch. Neo added that plans are in place for the transition for decentralized apps ( DApps ), and developers should be able to continue building Dapps because most new features are backwards compatible. Zhang said the upgrade will increase Neo’s speed and stability by orders of magnitude and make it suitable for large-scale commercial use. The new chain is scheduled to be completed by the second quarter of 2020 and a testnet is due to launch by June, with new features deployed for testing as they are completed. He added: “When we talk about Neo 3.0 being ready for large-scale commercial use, we mean it provides the possibility to run large-scale applications with blockchain technology. In the future, we'd like to see applications such as YouTube, Alipay, and gaming giants like Tencent and Blizzard run on blockchain, and Neo 3.0 will allow these big organizations to do that.” In February, Cointelegraph reported that Neo was  opening  a new office in Seattle, with former Microsoft executive John deVadoss at the helm. On April 18, Binance  launched  its mainnet Binance Chain. Work is now under way to  convert  binance coin (BNB)  from the old  ether -compatible ERC-20 technical standard to a native BEP-2 Binance Chain standard.

binance,Features,"Binance, Bitfinex and Tether: What's the Worst That Can Happen?","Daniel Cawrey is chief executive officer of Pactum Capital, a quantitative cryptocurrency investment firm and hedge fund.  The views expressed are those of the authors and are not investment advice. All investors, institutional or otherwise, have a duty to try to see the world as it truly is. Not as they wish it to be. This is especially true when putting investment dollars at risk. One needs to ask questions to understand elements influencing the outcome of an investment. One of those questions is: How could things go wrong here? Investment guru  Charlie Munger, for example, says : “Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don't we want to go, and how do you get there?” There is potential for catastrophic, systemic risk in crypto right now. Recent events surrounding Binance, Bitfinex and the stablecoin Tether necessitate this conversation. Yet it is strange how infrequently one hears the concept of systemic risk mentioned in this space. Headed towards default? The New York Attorney General continues to  demand more information from Bitfinex and Tether . The NYAG indicates that there are numerous inconsistencies with Bitfinex/Tether's statements. This makes them want to “understand what has taken place, and what continues to take place, at these companies.” Even so, a judge  has narrowed the scope of information  that Bitfinex/Tether need to provide. Source: TokenAnalyst Now, if we read ever so slightly between the lines, there seems to be a suggestion that there may be further improprieties. Or at least the NYAG is reasonably certain it is worthwhile to investigate this further.  They’ve already stated  that they believe there may be fraud involved. So, it makes sense that they want to find out the extent of it and whether other illegal activities have happened or continue to happen. If this indeed turns out to be the case, enforcement action could be taken by the government against Tether. If such action prevents USDT from being freely traded, holders of tether would then almost certainly sustain significant losses. But that’s only part of the picture. Binance has decided to  suspend deposits and withdrawals  for a week after a $40 million hack. Suspension of funding flows is never a good thing, especially since Binance’s public USDT wallet has been  drained of hundreds of millions of dollars  without explanation. Really, how bad could it be? Remarkably, USDT is still the most widely used stablecoin. Traders use it extensively to move into and out of positions on crypto exchanges across the globe. However, it’s possible USDT could get locked up or otherwise become unusable. There would likely be a cascade of activity following that. This could cause massive, ecosystem-wide harm to the entire crypto space. Many exchanges (including Binance nd Bitfinex) likely couldn’t function. Assets would likely get locked up in court battles that could take years to resolve.  Think Lehman Brothers . When they fell, the rest of Wall Street felt the pain. As an interesting side note, it is possible that large traders or other holders decide to sell off USDT. This would be in favor of a coin that is perceived to be safer, like BTC. This could happen with a lot of volume. It could drive up the price of BTC short-term as people exit USDT positions and park funds in BTC. It may be tempting to look at BTC’s recent price increase as a positive sign. Yet it is worthwhile to consider whether it may be due to people dumping tether positions and rolling them into BTC to some extent. A house of cards? Despite bad news, the BTC price keeps going up. Regulators could immediately take significant action against Bitfinex/Tether. It could have a cascading effect whereby exchanges simply blow up. To borrow a phrase from Bitmex’s Arthur Hayes, altcoins could get "" molly-whopped ."" If the government finds conclusive evidence of fraud committed by Tether or Bitfinex, then it stands to reason that decisive action would be taken as a result. The fallout from such a scenario would likely envelop the whole crypto space. Preparing for a potential crypto collapse may be a prudent and rational move. Those with large allocations to digital assets should think carefully. Imagine a large exchange locking up. Or traders panicking from the biggest stablecoin imploding or getting seized by authorities. Do you think crypto investments will be safe then? What exactly will happen to them if everyone is trying to head for the exits? A new hope ""Affairs are easier of entrance than of exit; and it is but common prudence to see our way out before we venture in."" When the Greek storyteller Aesop said this around the 6th century BC, it is highly unlikely that he was envisioning the digital asset ecosystem. And yet this quote contains untold amounts of wisdom. Much of which applies directly to crypto and digital asset investing. While we do actually hope we are wrong here, we also feel it’s better to err on the side of safety. If there is a systemic shock to the crypto space, it is likely that many investments will suffer. Both liquid crypto assets, and illiquid ones. If the shock is sufficiently bad, it would be reasonable to expect a repricing of assets that could take valuations back to 2016 or 2015 levels. Think about how you would exit a building if there were hundreds or thousands of people trying to exit through the same door as you. Before you walk into that building, you had better have an exit plan (or two) in place. Don’t believe us? Ask the people who lost their retirement savings because of the 2008 financial crisis.

binance,Markets,"SEC Negotiations Have Cost Kik $5 Million, Says CEO","Kik's CEO says the company has spent $5 million engaging with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) over what the regulator claims was an unregistered securities sale. Kik, a messaging platform founded by Canadian entrepreneur Ted Livingston in 2010,  raised $98 million  in an initial coin offering (ICO) at the end of 2017 to support its kin cryptocurrency and ecosystem. The SEC later indicated the sale may have violated U.S. securities laws, and that SEC staff would recommend bringing an enforcement action against the company. On Thursday, Livingston told CoinDesk at Token Summit in New York that this hasn't happened yet, but that both his firm and the regulator have been in talks since late 2017. ""We've spent a lot of money on this, over $5 million,"" he told CoinDesk. ""We've spent a lot of time on this, we've spent the last 18 months traveling to Washington."" In November 2018, the SEC filed a formal letter, known as  a Wells notice . In  Kik's response  to the SEC, the company highlighted a clause in existing law that says currencies are not securities, a comment Livingston echoed Thursday. Livingston maintains that kin is being used as a currency, adding: ""In the last month alone, over a million people earned kin from 40 different apps, from 40 different companies. Over a quarter million people used kin, making it the most-used cryptocurrency in the world, and they’re not even willing to say that’s not a security."" ""It just continues to drag out,"" he said. While Livingston said he does not have any plans to sue the SEC for greater regulatory clarity, he did say the agency needs to provide clear guidance. ""Enough is enough, you’ve been promising clarity for years now, somebody needs to go to court and get this settled,"" he said. Livingston said he does want to work with the SEC, however. Addressing the securities regulator, he said: ""We want to find a win-win with you, we understand the tough position you’re in, but at the same time innovation needs to move forward."" Regulatory uncertainty may be holding back the U.S. cryptocurrency industry, Livingston and others have argued during Blockchain Week. Developers need to pause as they try to determine what regulatory agencies might think of a particular innovation or process, he said, which slows down work. Indeed, many companies may be afraid of regulatory action, with only one  ""no-action"" letter  issued by the SEC to date. Competition is another issue, Livingston said. ""You have companies like Binance, who look at what Coinbase does and say, ‘We’ll do that but we’ll do it everywhere but the U.S.’ – and now Binance has replaced Coinbase as the top exchange in the world,"" he explained, adding: ""We do not want to get Binance'd.""

binance,Markets,Bahamas Securities Regulator Proposes Rules for Token Sales,"The Bahamas' securities regulator is pushing for a new framework for token projects, aiming to turn the island nation into the jurisdiction of choice for blockchain startups. The Securities Commission of the Bahamas has filed a draft of the new bill regulating token offerings not deemed securities. The bill lays out a procedure for registering such offerings and informing authorities and investors on the details of a token sale. The draft was submitted for public consultations March 27 and comments will be gathered until May 28, Christina Rolle, executive director of the commission, told CoinDesk. According to Rolle, the regulator is receiving a lot of comments and the consultation period will likely be extended for another month. Once it’s over, the document will be passed to the government of the Bahamas, and then to parliament. If everything goes as planned, the legislation may be passed this autumn, Rolle said. Several other island nations have recently introduced various legislation aiming to attract crypto projects. In Malta, the government  passed  three laws last June allowing to issue cryptocurrencies and trade in the country. The country scored a big win in the jurisdiction competition when Binance announced it was opening an office there in March. In Bermuda, a new law allows the projects carrying out initial coin offerings (ICOs) to apply to the minister of finance for fast approval. And Gibraltar, new legislation allowing the issuing and trading tokens is underway. Inbound requests “In late 2017, we started receiving a lot of interest in the jurisdiction for the registration of tokens. When we started to benchmark what was happening around the world we saw that we needed to create a legal framework,” Rolle said. She added that other regulatory bodies in the Bahamas, including the Ministry of Finance, also have been getting inquiries from token projects looking for a jurisdiction to register. Then the commission decided to come up with guidance that will give the token projects not deemed securities legal certainty. According to Rolle, the criteria for distinguishing security and utility tokens are still to be drafted and are expected to be ready before the end of May. Even some tokens representing equity shares might be exempted from the country’s securities law, but the rules for that are still in the works, Rolle said. In the meantime, a handful of companies that asked the commission for clarity have already received no-action letters, according to Rolle. These are letters written by staff members of a government agency stating that it will not take enforcement action against an entity for pursuing a proposed course of action. One of these companies was PO8, a project aiming to tokenize archeological artifacts. While the artifacts themselves are stored in museums in the Bahamas and around the world, PO8 will be issuing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) representing their value, CEO Matt Arnett told CoinDesk. The  letter , obtained by CoinDesk, says that “the Commission will not pursue any enforcement action against PO8"" if it issues the NFTs, as the plan is not subject to existing securities law. However, once the new legislation is passed, PO8 will have to comply with it, the letter says. What’s in the bill According to the  bill , shared with CoinDesk, the new regulation will apply to token issuers, wallet providers, exchanges and anyone who is facilitating an initial token offering on the Bahamas. The bill obliges token projects to publish a memorandum with a description of the project, and if any significant changes are made to the offering, like the class of tokens or the scale of fundraising, the memorandum should be updated in a timely manner. Any information that can “reasonably negatively affect the interests” of token buyers should also be disclosed by the issuer immediately, and the failure to do so might cost the company a fine of 10,000 Bahamian dollars ($10,000), the document says. Companies should also secure adequate insurance coverage for their projects. In the application for the registration, a company would have to give a detailed technical and financial description of the token issuance, covering the project’s technology; governance; risks related to anti-money-laundering and counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) regulations; and even the system’s scalability — this will help the regulators evaluate the projects' viability, Rolle said. The document doesn’t elaborate on how scalability will be measured. To register, token projects will need to hire an attorney who will be the “sponsor” of the registration and communicate with the regulator. Registrants will be subject to the Bahamas’ Data Protection Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Act, Financial Transactions Reporting Regulations and Financial Intelligence Regulations, the draft says. Failure to comply with the law will lead to a fine of $500,000 or imprisonment up to five years, and if issuers file misleading information in their registration documents, they risk up to ten years in prison.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers: XEM, XLM, XTZ, BNB, IOTA ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. Market data provided by  HitBTC  exchange. After the strong recovery of the past few weeks, this week saw some profit booking at the highs. However, unlike previous occasions, the dip has been shallow and some buying is visible close to support levels. This shows that the market sentiment is changing from sell on rallies to buy on dips. After the sharp move from the lows, a few weeks of consolidation is also possible. In its report, the European Central Bank said that the impact of cryptocurrencies on the real economy is  limited , as only a handful of merchants accept them due to their high volatility. However, they find some value in the stablecoins. We believe that the uses of cryptocurrencies have been increasing in the real world, and this is likely to penetrate further in the next few years. The launch of a cryptocurrency by Facebook will also speed up the  adoption  among the masses. Though many people want to invest in cryptocurrencies, they are wary of the negative propaganda surrounding them. Some might even find the technology aspect of it a little difficult to understand in the beginning. To address this issue, Coinbase had started its Coinbase Earn program at the end of 2018, which was by invite only, but the exchange has now  opened  the program for the public. XEM/USD Nem ( XEM ) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies. Though it has given up some of its gains, it is still significantly higher for the week. While part of the gains would have come due to the positive sentiment across the asset class, the fundamental news also helped. The markets cheered the Catapult  update , which will improve the overall NEM platform and make it more user-friendly and convenient to use. Another piece of positive news is that Zeux will  add  XEM on its digital payment wallet, after which its users can pay with the cryptocurrency at the merchants that accept Apple Pay and Samsung Pay. Can it continue its recovery? The XEM/USD pair is attempting to breakout of the overhead resistance of $0.085. If successful, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $0.135946775. The digital currency has a horizontal resistance at $0.13125258. We expect a stiff resistance between these two levels. A breakout of $0.14 is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the digital currency to $0.45 with a minor resistance at $0.20. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears defend the overhead resistance. In such a case, a few more days of range bound action is likely. The bears will gain an upper hand on a breakdown of $0.045. XLM/USD On May 15, the Stellar ( XLM ) network briefly  stopped : during the period of downtime, the network did not process any transaction. Though no one lost any money, it shows that the network needs some  improvements . In separate news, the Stellar Development Foundation announced the release of a  new  ticker API that will provide the latest data about markets and assets on the network. The XLM/USD pair broke out of the long-term downtrend line this week, which is a bullish sign —iIt signals the end of the downtrend. The pair has also formed an inverse head and shoulders pattern, which will complete on a breakout and close above the overhead resistance of $0.14861760. Though the bulls had scaled this level during the week, they could not sustain the breakout as sellers stepped in close to the 50-week SMA. The price has again retreated back below $0.14861760. If the bulls fail to ascend the overhead resistance, the pair might enter into a consolidation for a few weeks. But if the price breaks out and closes (UTC time frame) above $0.14861760, it will complete the bullish reversal pattern that has a target objective of $0.22466773. Above this level, it can move to $0.2885. Our positive view will be invalidated if the digital currency plunges below the right shoulder. XTZ/USDT The Tezos ( XTZ ) community is currently voting to accept or reject the  Athens  A Upgrade. The voting process will  close  on May 29. If the upgrade is accepted, will the price move higher? Let’s see what charts project. The XTZ/USDT pair has broken out of the 50-week SMA, which is a positive sign. It is currently close to the overhead resistance at $1.85. A breakout and close (UTC time frame) above this level will complete a rounding bottom pattern that has a target objective of $3.37. Both the moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover that will indicate the start of a new uptrend. The next level to watch on the upside is $4.2424. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to ascend the resistance, the pair might consolidate between $1.85 and $1.295480 for a few weeks. A break below the moving averages will break the positive momentum that is building up. BNB/USD Withdrawals and deposits that had been temporarily suspended after this month’s  hack  of more than 7,000 BTC  restarted  this week. A major system  upgrade  was also completed during the week. Sports blockchain venture Chiliz has also announced a  partnership  with Binance Chain, and Binance Launchpad announced the  sale  of the harmony token via the lottery format on May 28. Can binance coin ( BNB ) extend its up move? Let’s find out. The BNB/USD pair continues to be in a strong uptrend. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone: this shows that the bulls have the upper hand. The buyers aggressively purchased the dip and propelled the price to new lifetime highs again this week, which shows that every dip is being bought. The next level to watch on the upside is $33, which is close to the resistance line that has acted as a stiff resistance on previous occasions. If this level is also crossed, the rally can extend to $40.2919564. A drop below the recent low of $17.7997862 will turn the pair negative. IOTA/USDT Iota ( IOTA ) wants to make the ecosystem easy to use and safe for organizations, large token holders and liquidity providers. It is exploring various  measures  by which these players, who form an important part of the ecosystem, can be supported adequately. Iota will  sponsor  the first inaugural Texas Smart Cities Summit that aims to bring various visionaries to discuss the actions needed to accelerate smart city efforts across the state. Luxury fashion brand Alyx will also  partner  with IOTA to improve the transparency of its supply chain. The IOTA/USDT pair has been range bound between $0.244553 and $0.385033 for the past few weeks. The bulls had broken out of the range during the week, but failed to sustain the higher levels. If the price fails to close (UTC time frame) above the range, the consolidation will extend for a few more weeks. On the other hand, if the price ascends the overhead resistance, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the price to $0.50 and above it to $0.80. The pair will weaken if the bears sink the price below the support of the range.

binance,Markets,Bitfinex Enters the Initial Exchange Offering Race With Tokinex,"Bitfinex announced today its first foray into the increasingly popular business of initial exchange offerings (IEOs). A new Bitfinex service called  Tokinex  will announce its first token launch this Thursday, followed by the debut of a second token on June 13. ""What it means to be an exchange has evolved alongside the maturing crypto market. It has become an entire ecosystem, not just limited to the remit of trading digital assets,"" said Jean Louis van der Velde, CEO of Bitfinex and Ethfinex. Bitfinex  follows other major exchanges  like OKCoin, KuCoin and Binance into this new line of business. Thus far there have been several advantages to fundraising with an IEO over an initial coin offering (ICO). Most notably, the arrangement usually comes with a commitment from the exchange to handle all Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) checks on a startup's behalf. IEOs also usually come with a commitment by the exchange to promote the offering to its pool of customers. These services usually are contingent on hefty fees, but startups approved to run on Tokinex will face no upfront costs and, after successfully completing fundraising, the token will become listed on both Bitfinex and Ethfinex, according to company officials. Participants will register through the Tokinex site where they will receive KYC checks from Blockpass, research materials on offerings and settlements through their existing exchange wallet. A Bitfinex spokesperson told CoinDesk users will not be charged fees to access these sales. ""You also don't need to hold any exchange tokens to participate,"" they said. In addition to Tokinex, the company just  launched LEO , its exchange token. Previously, Binance tested the idea of using a token to lower trading expenses on a given exchange with  its BNB token . Update (May 21, 13:58 UTC):  Following publication, Bitfinex replied to a request for comment about user participation costs. The article has been updated with that information.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers: BSV, BNB, LTC, BCH, DASH ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. Instant messaging service Telegram reportedly  plans  to launch its Telegram Open Network (TON) in the third quarter of this year. It has  created  a new programming language called Fift, which will help develop and manage TON blockchain smart contracts and interact with the TON Virtual Machine. On the other hand, Facebook is allegedly planning to  launch  its own cryptocurrency in early 2020. The company expects its large user base to start using its cryptocurrency in a dozen countries for making purchases, transferring money and more. Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and chief executive of Facebook, has reportedly discussed the project with U.S. Treasury officials along with Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England.   Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz believes that one of the crypto assets created by the above-mentioned companies is likely to be  successful  and can even have a “chance to be a real currency.” He also reiterated that the “crypto winter is over” in comments this week. And, according to token rating platform ICObench, the  ICO sector  is showing a higher success rate as the sentiment improves. BSV/USD Bitcoin sv ( BSV ) was the best performer among the major cryptocurrencies with a rally of above 60% in the past seven days. The boost came amid the news that nChain founder Craig Wright had  filed  United States copyright registrations for the Bitcoin white paper and the original code used to build Bitcoin. However, the bitcoin community and a few experts  do not  consider this to be an important event that can alter the fortunes of bitcoin sv. But what do the charts project? Let us find out. The BSV/USD pair skyrocketed this week and reached the overhead resistance of $134.360. However, profit booking and selling just above this resistance resulted in the pair giving up a large part of its gains. The cryptocurrency should find some support at the current levels, failing which, the drop can extend to $82.489 and lower. While the sharp up move from the lows shows buying at lower levels, the failure to hold onto the gains shows a lack of demand at higher levels. The pair will pick up momentum on a close (UTC time frame) above $134.360 and will weaken below $38.528. Until then, it is likely to remain range bound between these two levels. BNB/USD Binance coin ( BNB ) has been one of the strongest performers among the major coins: it has consistently made new highs and is in a strong uptrend. Riding high on its success, cryptocurrency exchange Binance is reportedly planning to offer  margin  trading to its clients. The exchange is also giving away $1,000 of $ONE tokens to celebrate the  launch  of the forthcoming token sale. How far can the rally continue? Let us find out. The BNB/USD pair is in a strong uptrend and has picked up momentum after breaking out of previous lifetime highs. Earlier, the resistance line had acted as a major roadblock, but the bulls are currently attempting to breakout of it. If successful, the rally can extend to $40 and above it to $46.1645899, which is a 1.618 Fibonacci extension level. But the rally is getting vertical and the RSI on the weekly charts is threatening to enter deeply overbought territory. This shows that the up move has been overdone in the short-term, and that a minor correction or consolidation can start between $40 and $46.1645899. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) is benefitting from the positive sentiment in the crypto space, and the forthcoming  halving  has added to the bullishness. A series of  tweets  by OKEx pointing to some kind of an announcement regarding Litecoin has also heightened interests. Can the upward move continue?   The LTC/USD pair has completed a cup and handle reversal pattern that has a minimum target objective of $158.81. If the momentum continues, the upward move can extend to $172.647. The moving averages completed a bullish crossover a couple of weeks back and the 20-week EMA is sloping up: this shows that the bulls have the upper hand. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency fails to sustain the breakout and dips below the support of $91 once again. The support levels to watch on the downside are $84.3439, $74.6054 and below it to $60.1980. BCH/USD Two miners who control about 43% of the bitcoin cash ( BCH ) mining pool, BTC.top and BTC.com, joined hands this week and executed a  51% attack  to stop an unknown miner from taking coins that were accidentally sent to “anyone can spend” addresses. In this case, the attackers did not carry out the 51% attack for their own benefit, but still some believe that it shows that the cryptocurrency is too centralized. How does its chart look? The BCH/USD pair is currently rising inside an ascending channel. It has crossed above both the moving averages, which is a positive sign. The bulls are facing selling at the resistance line of the channel, but the positive thing is that the pair has not given up ground. If the price holds above the 50-week SMA, we should see another attempt to breakout of the channel. If successful, a rally to $620 is probable. On the contrary, if the bulls fail to scale the resistance line of the channel, the digital currency can dip to the support line of the channel, closer to $300. A breakdown of this support will break the trend. DASH/USD Dash ( DASH ) released its latest version 0.14 on the mainnet, which is another step leading to version 1.0, dubbed evolution. The upgrade improves the security of the network against 51% mining attacks, the first for proof-of-work networks, according to Dash Core CEO Ryan Taylor. An analysis by Cryptoslate shows that DASH has seen a growth of 58% in the active address count from 2018 to 2019, the largest growth among the major coins. This was reportedly mainly due to the surge in usage in crisis-hit Venezuela. The DASH/USD pair has been facing resistance at $176.81 since the past week, and a breakout of this barrier will propel the pair to the next level of $229.24. We expect the bulls to again face selling at these levels. Currently, both the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory. This shows that the bulls are at an advantage.   However, if the digital currency turns down from $176.81, it might enter into a consolidation. The support of the range will be at $107.36, and a break of this support will be a bearish sign.

binance, News , Binance Charity Foundation Signs Memorandum of Understanding With Ugandan NGO ,"Binance   Charity  Foundation (BCF), the charity arm of major  crypto   exchange  Binance, has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Safe Future, a non-governmental organization (NGO) in  Uganda  focused on local education improvements. Binance announced the development in an official blog  post  on May 30. The Binance for Children Special Impact Education Project Uganda reportedly aims to provide a number of new supplies to schools in Uganda, such as solar panels, sanitary pads, school supplies, LED screens, as well as breakfast and lunch for students. According to the CEO of Safe Future, Mula Anthony, these developments will reach 100,000 students and 160 schools in the region. As shared in an official  Twitter   post  shared on May 28, Anthony said the project has begun with the installation of lighting kits in two Kampala schools. As previously  reported  on Cointelegraph, the BCF previously launched its pilot charity campaign “Lunch for Children” with the stated aim of providing breakfast and lunch to students in Kampala throughout 2019. As per the recent announcement, the project has since expanded to include 10 schools in Kampala and Jinja. The charity arm of Binance reportedly intends to ultimately aid one million students in  Africa , in countries such as Rwanda,  Kenya , and Ethiopia. In April, the BCF  opened  a cryptocurrency donation channel to fund the rebuilding of the Notre Dame cathedral. The program, called “Rebuild Notre-Dame,” had received thousands of dollars via bitcoin ( BTC ), ether ( ETH ), and Binance’s internal token Binance Coin ( BNB ).",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-charity-foundation-signs-memorandum-of-understanding-with-ugandan-ngo,cointelegraph,2019-05-31,00:00:00,en,253,1601,5.24901185770751,81,0.3201581027667984,binance foundation bcf arm crypto exchange binance signed memorandum understanding mou safe future governmental organization uganda focused local education improvement binance announced development official blog binance child special impact education project uganda reportedly aim provide number supply school uganda solar panel sanitary pad school supply led screen breakfast lunch student ceo safe future mula development reach student school region shared official twitter shared project begun installation lighting kit kampala school previously reported cointelegraph bcf previously launched pilot campaign lunch child stated aim providing breakfast lunch student kampala recent announcement project expanded include school kampala jinja arm binance reportedly intends ultimately aid student africa country rwanda ethiopia bcf opened cryptocurrency donation channel fund rebuilding notre cathedral program called rebuild notre received thousand dollar bitcoin btc ether eth binance internal token binance coin bnb,0.09307359307359307,positive,0.30952380952380953,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9571}",0.9571,0.0,0.843,0.157,positive,0.9999990000010001,0.008620689580856124,positive
binance,Markets,"Malta Needs to Up Its AML Game As Crypto Sector Grows, Says EU","Malta needs to increase its levels of anti-money laundering (AML) policing to match the growth in financial services, according to the EU. As  reported  by Malta Today, the European Commission said the island jurisdiction's moves to boost its cryptocurrency sector, alongside sizable financial and gaming industries, mean an effective AML regime is required. The comments came in recommendations made to EU member nations regarding spending of EU funding. The commission said that it was ""positive"" that Malta's Financial Intelligence Analysis Unit had seen increases in budget and staffing levels, and other procedures had been ramped up. However, it sees scope for government failings that could affect Malta's business prospects. The commission said: “Governance shortcomings, particularly in the fight against corruption, may also adversely affect the business environment and weigh negatively on investment. In particular, there is a risk of conflict of interest at various levels of government. Further, it said the Malta Police Force’s Economic Crimes Unit is not adequately staffed, according to the report. ""In this context, it is important to couple a strengthened legislative framework with timely and thorough implementation,” said the commission. Malta has been actively working to create a friendly regulatory regime for the blockchain and cryptocurrency industry. To that end, the island's government passed  several pieces  of legislation last summer that have since seen notable crypto exchanges such as  Binance  and  OKCoin  open offices there. The nation has already been taking some steps to more effectively spot suspect crypto activity. Last month, the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA)  announced  that it would integrate CipherTrace’s Compliance Monitoring product to “protect consumers, investors and business partners.” The tool uses blockchain analytics and forensics to look out for “suspicious” addresses and wallets, according to CipherTrace’s website. The firm says it profiles cryptocurrency exchanges, ATMs, coin mixers and money laundering systems, as well as known criminal addresses, to score transactions and gauge the level of risk. The MFSA said the system also de-anonymizes blockchain addresses, allowing regulators to “evaluate and monitor the trustworthiness of virtual asset businesses.” Malta and EU flags  image via Shutterstock",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/06/05/malta-needs-to-up-its-aml-game-as-crypto-sector-grows-says-eu/,coindesk,2019-06-05,17:30:00,en,345,2383,5.878260869565217,115,0.3333333333333333,malta increase level anti laundering aml policing match growth financial service eu reported malta today european commission island jurisdiction move boost cryptocurrency sector alongside sizable financial gaming industry effective aml regime required comment recommendation made eu member spending eu funding commission positive malta financial intelligence analysis unit increase budget staffing level procedure ramped see scope government failing affect malta business prospect commission governance shortcoming fight corruption adversely affect business environment weigh negatively investment risk conflict interest level government malta police force economic crime unit adequately staffed report context important couple strengthened legislative framework timely implementation commission malta actively working create friendly regulatory regime blockchain cryptocurrency industry end island government passed piece legislation notable crypto exchange binance okcoin open office taking step effectively spot suspect crypto activity malta financial service authority mfsa announced integrate ciphertrace compliance monitoring product protect consumer investor business partner tool blockchain analytics forensics suspicious address wallet ciphertrace website firm profile cryptocurrency exchange atm coin mixer laundering system criminal address score transaction gauge level risk mfsa system de anonymizes blockchain address allowing regulator evaluate monitor trustworthiness virtual asset business malta eu flag image shutterstock,0.12234848484848485,positive,0.39604377104377103,"{'neg': 0.117, 'neu': 0.641, 'pos': 0.242, 'compound': 0.9816}",0.9816,0.117,0.641,0.242,positive,-0.1999999900000005,0.11235954993056432,negative
binance,Markets,Binance Confirms Stablecoin Offering Coming Soon: Report,"Binance, the top crypto exchange by adjusted trading volume, has confirmed it will soon issue its own stablecoins. In a phone interview with   Bloomberg , Binance's chief financial officer, Wei Zhou, said the first stablecoin will be launched on the platform ""in a matter of weeks to a month or two."" According to Zhou, the token will be called Binance GBP, which will be fully backed by reserves of British pounds. More coins tied to other fiat currencies will follow, he said, while Binance will also work with partners wanting to issue their own stablecoins on the exchange's native blockchain, Binance Chain. The move by Binance will add to the fast-growing number of rivals to the market-leading but controversial stablecoin tether. Issued by an entity linked to crypto exchange Bitfinex, tether has recently  been revealed  to not, in fact, be fully backed by U.S. dollar holdings as was previously claimed. Tether Ltd is also involved in a  legal dispute  with the New York attorney general over a secretive loan to its sister firm. With such issues likely to affect investor confidence, Binance's stablecoin offerings could see some adoption, with Zhou telling Bloomberg the tokens will be 100 percent fiat backed and will offer more transparency. For now, though, Binance has no plans to introduce a U.S. dollar-backed stablecoin, according to Zhou.

binance,Markets,John McAfee's New Crypto Trading Platform 'Magic' Goes Live,"Noted cybersecurity expert and eccentric crypto fan John McAfee has just launched a cryptocurrency trading platform. Dubbed ""Magic,"" the  site  is touted as allowing users to ""trade cryptocurrencies on multiple exchanges within a single dashboard, automatically and manually."" Notably, the exchange appears to be non-custodial, with users' crypto holdings remaining on eight other exchange platforms. When a trade is executed, funds are transferred from those accounts to complete the transaction. To set this up, users will need to plug in APIs from their other exchanges. In its  guide  to using the platform, Magic lists Binance, Kraken, Poloniex, Huobi, Bittrex, HitBtc, Exmo and Livecoin as the supported exchanges. Two ""portals"" are on offer, one for normal spot trading, the other for ""shadow trading,"" in which a user's trades will be set to mimic those of pro-level traders who are ""ranked by the community by their trading success,"" McAfee indicated in a  tweeted  image. Other features include the ""set and forget"" ability to set buy and sell orders at the same time. Users can also use the platform to make auto trades on their behalf. There are no jurisdictional restrictions on who can use the exchange. Regarding the security on offer, the Magic's FAQs say that the site is hosted on ""top grade"" Amazon Web Service servers that come with DDoS protection and can ""scale on demand."" The site also reads: ""We are only releasing this platform to the public after extensive testing and auditing processes that stretched months."" Magic seems to have faced a DDoS attack even before launch. In a pre-launch tweet, McAfee  quipped : ""McAfeeMagic.com still under attack. New I.P. address in Texas.

Just 10 days ago, McAfee also  announced  he would launch a cryptocurrency dubbed the ""McAfee Freedom Coin"" this autumn. Somewhat confusingly, he said at the time: “The McAfee Freedom Coin is designed to confront the problem of exchange head-on… It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it’s natural market value is free, completely, to grow.""

binance,Markets,'I Don’t Trust Facebook With Anything:' The World Reacts to Facebook's Libra,"Although Libra hasn’t yet officially launched, pundits, politicians, and developers are already weighing in with warnings, celebrations, and memes. US representatives from both sides of the aisle have already chimed in. “Facebook is already too big and too powerful, and it has used that power to exploit users’ data without protecting their privacy,” Representative Sherrod Brown, the leading Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, tweeted out. “We cannot allow Facebook to run a risky new cryptocurrency out of a Swiss bank account without oversight.”  Maxine Waters, House Financial Services Committee Chairwoman, also expressed concerns. Even asking Facebook to stop the project until Congress can understand it further. She is joined by Republican Senator Patrick McHenry. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) told Yahoo Finance it sounds like Facebook is “expanding their monopoly” with its new  cryptocurrency project . “We need to see exactly what their specific proposals are, but I'm very concerned about Facebook's behavior on a range of fronts. I'm concerned about their size, I'm concerned about their anti-competitive conduct, I'm concerned about their rampant violations of privacy,” Hawley said. He even called for an investigation into breaking up the social media giant. “There needs to be an  antitrust investigation . I hope one will go forward, but in the meantime, in the immediate future with this consent decree — if it's just a fine of a few billion dollars, that's a speeding ticket to Facebook. They need to get serious,” he said. “Name Mark Zuckerberg. Name him, if he has in fact participated in violating consent decree as reports indicate. And let's consider some tougher penalties, too.” “I don’t trust Facebook with anything,” he said. “Facebook’s new Libra blockchain project has the potential to be a big step forward towards a more global and inclusive financial infrastructure,” said U.S. Congressman Darren Soto, Co-Chair of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus. “We are encouraged by the possibility of increasing access to mobile and digital payments, which will ultimately benefit our society and become a driver of economic growth. While it is yet unclear how this new technology will be regulated, it is crucial Congress continues to protect consumers and the financial well-being of investors, while simultaneously promoting innovation for these virtual currencies.” “In the Congressional Blockchain Caucus we are working in a bipartisan manner to educate and maximize Blockchain technologies’ potential for the U.S. economy. We applaud the thoughtfulness behind the Libra Association. If efforts to achieve this multi-level cryptocurrency coordination is successful – one that protects consumers and prioritizes user privacy – this could be a significant advancement for the 21st Century economy,” he said. Pundits Come In Punching On the private side of things, pundit Jim Cramer was ecstatic.  “The disenfranchised will welcome  Mark Zuckerberg  as a savior, ” he said on CNBC’s  “Squawk on the Street.”  He sees it as a solution to the underbanked in American cities where “check cashing places” are the closest consumers can get to money services.  Bankers and startup founders see Libra’s success as inevitable. “They’re not the first company to launch a crypto payment solution, but they do have immense reach obviously through their Facebook platform,” said  NAB's business banking chief  Anthony Healy. “With a billion plus users on its platform, it is clearly a threat.” “If it’s successful, it's not just going to have the traditional qualities of a corporate currency like Westfield dollars or, Qantas Frequent Flyer points, it’s really a governance play,” said Asher Tan, founder of CoinJar. “Like all fintech disrupters, they’re all potential threats, but they’re also opportunities for us to learn, and if some of these emerge as real threats we can learn from them, develop our own capabilities and respond appropriately.” Crypto grandfather Erik Vorhees is obviously excited about the move. “Zoom out for a second and realise how far this industry has come,” he  tweeted . “The biggest companies in the world are now launching cryptocurrencies. BOOM.” Spencer Chen of BRD Wallet, thinks crypto people should stop “shitting” on Libra. Jerry Brito, executive director over at the research non-profit CoinCenter, raised important questions about the future of Libra: ""Of course, there must be more to joining the Investment Token club than merely meeting the outlined requirements (seems like Huawei and Gazprombank might qualify), though it’s not clear to me if it’s a majority vote of the membership or what."" Changpeng Zhao, CEO of the cryptocurrency exchange Binance,  wrote  that Facebook has a chance to “reshape the payment industry” and start the “un-dollarisation of the world.” “Facebook’s initiative, with the Libra cryptocurrency at the center of the project, will have a significant impact on the financial industry and global economies from both a medium and long-term perspective,” he wrote. “Backed by a basket of fiat currency-denominated assets in its initial release, Libra represents a first attempt at creating a world currency, on-chain or not, with everyday usage by billions of individuals and institutions across the globe.” Librexit Europe, on the other hand, is calling for far more scrutiny. ""As a reminder, the principle of e-money in Europe is that a customer credits an e-money account usually from a bank account or a credit card (or more recently from cash-in / cash-out points at partner merchants). This e-money account is opened in the books of an e-money institution and customers can use this e-money to make online payments to merchants who accept it (for example very few today do not accept PayPal). The difference with Facebook's Libra is almost solely that Libra will be indexed to a basket of currencies rather than being representative of a single currency,"" said Emilien Bernard-Alzias of legal firm Simmons & Simmons LLP. ""Therefore, Libra project is not significantly revolutionizing the financial market in Europe and does not really challenge the European Central Bank (ECB). As announced in the Libra’s white paper, this project is much more game changing for people having poor access to banking services over the world.""  ""The proposed launch of a digital coin (cryptocurrency) by Facebook will require careful scrutiny from several enforcement bodies, including data protection authorities,"" said European Data Protection Supervisor Giovanni Buttarelli. Bruno Le Maire already called upon the Group of Seven central bank governors to prepare a report on Facebook’s project for the upcoming July meetings. Expressing a latent anxiety about the disruption of national currencies for the Euro, he said: “It is out of question” that Libra “become a sovereign currency... It can’t and it must not happen.” Markus Ferber, a German member of the European Parliament, was also concerned about Facebook’s supranational spread, adding to the conversation that with more than 2 billion users the tech-giant could become a “shadow bank.”  “Multinational corporations such as Facebook must not be allowed to operate in a regulatory nirvana when introducing virtual currencies,” he said, sounding the alarm for regulators. ""It is no surprise that Facebook Inc.’s ambitious plan to roll out its own cryptocurrency — Project Libra ran into immediate political opposition in Europe, with calls for tighter regulation of the social-media giant,"" reflected Robin Matze, Blockchain Lawyer and Advisor to the German Government. ""AML (Anti Money Laundering) laws usually take a risk-based approach. Therefore, Facebook would have to take reasonable measures in order to mitigate that risk."" Matze offered a potential solution to this nebula of risk and regulations, though it may not be what Facebook wants to hear... ""The easiest way to be compliant to various jurisdiction is - a fortiori - to apply the strictest regime. This approach is definitely not the cheapest for each jurisdiction but the easiest to manage on a global level."" On the other hand, TransferWise, a London-based fintech firm focused on money transfers and cross-border payments, thinks Facebook's global reach works in its favor. The company’s CTO Harsh Sinha said “large companies with large resources” can help facilitate conversations with regulators. “The reality is that there is quite a bit of regulatory work that goes into putting up a global network of payments but maybe there’s a way to bypass that,” he told  CNBC . Bank of England Governor Mark Carney also appeared more optimistic about the project. “Anything that works in this world will become instantly systemic and will have to be subject to the highest standards of regulations,” the central banker said Tuesday.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers: NEO, XMR, BTC, BNB, ETH ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. For the agile trader, cryptocurrency trading offers a great opportunity to earn huge returns within a short span of time. It is also uncorrelated to other asset classes, hence, it can act as a safe haven investment during an economic crisis. In  Brazil , which is reeling under a slowdown and high unemployment rate,  1.5 million  people are investing in cryptocurrencies compared to the local stock markets called B3, which has 1 million investors. However, history has shown that if traders do not book profits or protect their paper profits, all their gains can vanish and bury the traders in huge losses. Therefore, do not chase prices higher and do not get overly greedy. Russia, which had banned crypto assets as a means of payment in May of last year is considering  allowing  cryptocurrency trading. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain are not only about making money. The technology is increasingly being used in various fields, including  charity , to improve productivity and bring  greater  transparency. NEO/USD Neo ( NEO ) was the best performer among major cryptocurrencies in the past seven days. The official  Twitter  page reported a fake website misleading token holders on the pretext of NEO 3.0 token swap. Can the digital currency pick up momentum and play catch up with other altcoins? Let us find out. The NEO/USD pair has scaled above both moving averages, which are on the verge of a bullish crossover. This is a positive sign and indicates advantage to the bulls. The up move might face selling in $20–$25 zone. Hence, a couple of weeks of consolidation or a minor correction cannot be ruled out. However, if the sentiment remains positive, we anticipate the bulls to eventually push the price above $25, which is likely to start a new uptrend. The next target to watch on the upside is $42. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair struggles to ascend the overhead resistance zone. In such a case, a few weeks of consolidation cannot be ruled out. The support on the downside is closer to $11. XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) was the second-best performer in the past seven days as it rallied about 20%. Currently, the community is focused on the first-ever Monero  Konferenco  on June 22 and 23. Could the price react positively to the events and continue its up-move in the coming weeks? Let’s analyze. The XMR/USD pair has continued to move up smartly for the past two weeks. It can now rise to $150. This level had acted as a major roadblock between June and September of last year. However, the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which indicates that bulls have the upper hand. They are likely to attempt to ascend $150. If successful, the pair might start a new uptrend that can carry it to $299, with minor resistance at $218.833 that is likely to be crossed. Conversely, if the bears defend $150, it might remain range bound between $81.167 and $150 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns around and plummets below $81. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has continued its  momentum  in the past week that has forced players sitting on the sidelines to jump in. As a result, bitcoin’s price  surged  from $10,000 to $11,000 within 24 hours. Not only the price has moved up; bitcoin’s hash rate also rose to a new  high  during the week. The  open interest  in bitcoin futures on  CME  hit a new high, which shows increased  institutional  interest. To cater to this higher demand, Galaxy Digital will introduce crypto  options  trading, which can be used by larger players for hedging purposes. After the recent price action, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder Tom Lee said that bitcoin can easily hit new lifetime  highs . Not only analysts, traders and bitcoin enthusiasts are positive on the cryptocurrency;  Ripple  CEO Brad Garlinghouse said that he was positive on bitcoin as a store of value and is  long  on it. Within two weeks, the BTC/USD pair skyrocketed from $7,513.79 to $11,165.69. That is a rally of 48.60% within a short span of time. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in overbought territory, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The pair is now likely to move up to $12,000 which is a critical resistance. Previously, this level had repeatedly posed a stiff challenge for the bulls. After such a sharp up move, we anticipate the digital currency to enter a minor pullback or a consolidation closer to $12,000. Any dip will find support at $10,000 but if this level breaks, the cryptocurrency will re-enter the ascending channel. It will signal a deeper correction if it breaks down of this channel. Contrary to our assumption, if the cryptocurrency breaks out of $12,000, it can spike to $16,000, but we give this a very low probability of occurring in the short term. BNB/USD Leading cryptocurrency exchange  Binance   announced  a bitcoin-pegged  token  on its blockchain Binance Chain that will be 100% backed by bitcoin. It will be available to trade both on Binance and its decentralized exchange Binance DEX. A report by Binance Research claimed that  Facebook’s  Libra  stablecoin  can  boost  cryptocurrency volume because it is likely to generate interest from both institutional and retail players. Most institutional players expect bitcoin to maintain its supremacy in 2019, according to a survey of institutional and VIP clients of Binance. However, the  survey  shows that respondents did not consider the crypto foray of Facebook,  Samsung  or  JPMorgan Chase  as the future drivers of the asset class. With consistently improving fundamentals, can binance coin ( BNB ) extend its up move? Let us find out. The BNB/USD pair is one of the strongest major cryptocurrencies as it continues to make new lifetime highs on a regular basis. This shows that the market participants are positive that the uptrend will continue. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command. If the bulls scale and sustain above $38.6463356, a rally to $46.1645899 and above it to $56.0786952 is probable. On the other hand, if the bears defend the overhead resistance, a few weeks of range bound action between $28 and $38.6463356 is possible. A minor correction or a few weeks of consolidation will be a healthy sign. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below $28 and the 20-week EMA. In such a case, a deeper correction can be expected. ETH/USD Grayscale Investments  launched  OTC trading in  Ethereum -based security Grayscale Ethereum Trust last week. This gives an opportunity to the traders to invest in ethereum ( ETH ) without actually holding the cryptocurrency. Can the largest altcoin by market capitalization extend its up-move or is it time for a correction to set in? The ETH/USD pair is knocking on the doors of the overhead resistance at $322.06. The moving averages are close to completing a bullish crossover and the RSI is near the overbought level, which indicates a trend change. A breakout and close above $322.06 can propel the price to $480 as there are no major resistance levels in between. On the other hand, if the bulls fail to push the price above $322.06, it might remain range-bound between $225.39 and $322.06 for a few days. The trend will turn down if the bears sink the pair below the critical support of $225.39 and the moving averages.

binance, News , 'Future is Here' Declares CEO as Binance Transfers $1.2 Billion for Under 2 Cents ,"On June 26, about $1.2 billion in binance coin ( BNB ) has been transferred in 1.1 seconds with a $0.015 fee on the binance chain, reveals data  published  on WhaleAlert, a platform tracking significant transactions. Earlier today, CEO of major  cryptocurrency exchange   Binance ,  Changpeng Zhao ,  warned  that big transactions should be expected. He explained that the exchange intended to split its BNB  cold wallet  in multiple addresses. After the transaction took place, Zhao  cited  some data about its cost and speed: “This transaction: cost $0.015 USD in fees, took 1.1 seconds, and $1.2 BILLION in value transferred. The future is here.” The exact amount of binance coins moved is 32,888,888. As a Twitter user  pointed out , 8 is a number like no other in  Chinese  numerology, to cite  Wikipedia : “the number 8 is viewed as such an auspicious number that even being assigned a number with several eights is considered very lucky.” Zhao answered  explaining  a curious strategy internal to his company: “It sort of signals it's not a  hack ,  hackers  will drain a wallet and not go for a lucky number.” Binance also recently  moved  9,001 bitcoin ( BTC ) to back its BTC-backed token on binance chain.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers: XMR, BTC, BNB, ETC, XRP ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. The current hot  debate  is whether bitcoin will continue to rally while altcoins languish. Many have been outspoken in support of the largest cryptocurrency as it maintains its market dominance above  62% . Though bitcoin is the undisputed leader, it is unlikely that it will remain the only cryptocurrency that will see a sharp increase in price.  We believe that after the recent rally, bitcoin will take a breather while traders shift their attention to altcoins. However, unlike the previous bull market, this time, the market will differentiate between altcoins depending on their use cases. Therefore, a few altcoins might outperform while others continue to struggle to move up. Traders should not buy tokens that have corrected sharply from their highs in hopes that their price will also recover. Their prices are near the lows for a reason. A better approach is to buy cryptocurrencies that have started to move up as it shows trader’s interest in them. Let’s look at the top five performers of the past seven days and analyze their charts.   XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) has risen by 8% in the past seven days and is the best performer among the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. If the market sentiment improves, can it continue its outperformance in the next few days? Let’s look at the charts. The sharp fall in the XMR/USD pair from close to $120 in the week before found buyers at the critical support of $81. This is a positive sign because it shows that bulls are keen to buy on dips. This is the third time that $81 has held since mid-May, hence, this now becomes the new floor for the pair. Both the moving averages are on the verge of a bullish crossover on the weekly charts. This shows that the trend is changing and traders should utilize dips to buy. The cryptocurrency is likely to trade between $81 and $150 for the next few weeks. As the range is large, traders can initiate long positions at the current levels and keep a close stop loss just below $78. The target objective is a rally to $150. Though there is a minor resistance at $120, we expect it to be crossed. This trade has an attractive risk to reward ratio. Our view will be invalidated if bears sink the price below $81. The next support on the downside is at $60. BTC/USD With the recovery in prices, bitcoin ( BTC ) bulls are getting confident again. Sky-high targets are back on the table. Anthony Pompliano, co-founder of crypto asset management firm Morgan Creek Digital Assets, expects bitcoin to hit  $100,000  by the end of 2021. Pompliano has walked the talk and has invested  50%  of his wealth in bitcoin.  A report by Binance shows that the correlation between bitcoin and altcoins has decreased from 0.73 in Q1 2019 to  0.61  in Q2 2019. In the current leg of the up-move,  bitcoin futures  volumes have spurted. This shows that large traders are investing in the cryptocurrency. However, institutional traders are unlikely to continue their buying spree as prices skyrocket higher. Therefore, we do not expect the rally to sustain. What is a good level to buy? Let’s analyze the charts. The uptrend from the lows ended with the BTC/USD pair forming a gravestone doji in the week before. Though buying was seen below $10,000, as suggested by us in the  previous  analysis, failure of bulls to sustain highs of the week shows that traders stuck at higher levels are bailing out of their positions closer to $12,000. If buyers fail to break out and sustain the price above $12,000 in the next week, it will attract further profit booking that can drag the price below $10,000 levels once again. If bears plummet the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $9,965.48, the price can extend the correction to $8,727.40, which is the 50% retracement of the recent rally. A breakdown of this level can drag the price to the uptrend line. The upsloping 20-week EMA is also just below this line. Hence, we anticipate strong buying if the cryptocurrency corrects to this level. As the trend has changed from down to up, traders should use these dips to buy. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls propel the price above $12,000, the digital currency can retest $14,000. A breakout of $14,000 will resume the uptrend but we give it a low probability of occurring in the short term. We believe traders should wait and buy on dips instead of chasing the price higher. BNB/USD Binance is planning to launch futures trading in bitcoin with leverage of up to  20x . While leverage can be useful to an experienced trader, it can easily destroy a novice trader, so use it judiciously. The leading cryptocurrency exchange has  switched  tether deposit and withdrawal addresses from Omni-based addresses to ERC-20-based addresses, which will be the standard going forward. Dogecoin (DOGE) prices  spurted  higher on the announcement that Binance will list it. With fundamentals remaining strong, can Binance Coin ( BNB ) resume its uptrend? While most cryptocurrencies are still struggling well below their lifetime highs made in the previous bull market, the BNB/USD pair continues to trade close to its lifetime highs.  The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the 50-week SMA is also turning up gradually. This is a positive sign and shows that the pair is in a strong uptrend. Any dip to strong support levels offers a low-risk buying opportunity to traders. The first support on the downside is $28.7168. If this support breaks, the fall can extend to the uptrend line. The 20-week EMA is also close to this line, hence, we anticipate strong buying at this support. Traders can watch the price action at the above-mentioned levels and buy in a phased manner. After the sharp up-move from the lows, the digital currency is likely to remain range-bound for a few weeks and consolidate the gains. The next leg of the up move will start on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $40. ETC/USD Recently, the  Atlantis  hard fork entered its testing stage. The update is scheduled for September. ETC Labs and Metronome also  announced  that chainhop functionality had been enabled between Ethereum and Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) blockchains. Though the cryptocurrency was backed by positive news on the fundamental front, how does its chart look? The recovery in the ETC/USD pair hit a wall close to $10.040. This shows profit-booking at higher levels. However, a minor positive is that bulls have kept the price above the 20-week EMA during the pullback. If the price rebounds off the 20-week EMA, bulls will again try to push the price above the $10.040–$11.880 resistance zone. This is likely to start a new uptrend that can carry the price to $15 and above it to $20. Traders can buy part of their intended position size above $10.040 and add the rest on a breakout above $11.880. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-week EMA, the pair can slip to $5.22. Therefore, we suggest traders wait for the price to break out before initiating fresh positions. XRP/USD Xpring, Ripple’s ecosystem initiative, claims to have committed  $500  million on  XRP  projects to over 20 companies since May of last year. The goal is to support projects that create use cases for Ripple’s XRP token. Let’s see what its chart projects. The XRP/USD pair has been a laggard during the recent recovery in crypto prices.  The bulls have repeatedly failed to sustain the price above $0.450, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. Currently, the pair is taking support closer to $0.370. Both the moving averages are also located at this level. Hence, this is an important support to watch out for.  If the price bounces off this support, bulls will again attempt to scale above the overhead resistance zone of $0.450 to $0.5050. We anticipate the digital currency to start a new uptrend and pick up momentum after it sustains above $0.5050.  However, if the price breaks below the moving averages, it can slide to $0.27795. A breakdown of the $0.27795–$0.24508 support zone will be hugely negative for the cryptocurrency. As the price is stuck inside the range, we believe that the best approach is to stay neutral on it until it starts a new uptrend. Notwithstanding, for traders who want to trade it, the best strategy would be to buy closer to the support and sell near the resistance.  The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/top-5-crypto-performers-xmr-btc-bnb-etc-xrp,cointelegraph,2019-07-07,00:00:00,en,1480,8640,4.812162162162162,665,0.44932432432432434,view opinion expressed solely author necessarily reflect view cointelegraph investment trading move involves risk conduct research making decision market data provided hitbtc exchange current hot debate bitcoin continue rally altcoins languish outspoken support largest cryptocurrency maintains market dominance bitcoin undisputed leader remain cryptocurrency increase recent rally bitcoin breather trader shift attention altcoins unlike previous market time market differentiate altcoins depending case altcoins outperform continue struggle move trader buy token corrected sharply high hope recover price low reason approach buy cryptocurrencies started move show trader interest top performer past day analyze chart xmr usd monero xmr risen past day performer top cryptocurrencies market capitalization market sentiment improves continue outperformance day chart fall xmr usd pair found buyer critical support positive sign show bull buy dip time mid floor pair moving average verge bullish crossover chart show trend changing trader utilize dip buy cryptocurrency trade trader initiate position current level stop loss target objective rally resistance expect crossed trade attractive risk reward ratio view invalidated bear support downside btc usd recovery price bitcoin btc bull confident sky target table pompliano founder crypto asset management firm creek digital asset expects bitcoin hit end pompliano walked talk invested wealth bitcoin report binance show correlation bitcoin altcoins decreased current leg move bitcoin future volume spurted show trader investing cryptocurrency institutional trader continue buying spree price skyrocket higher expect rally sustain level buy analyze chart uptrend low ended btc usd pair forming gravestone doji buying suggested previous analysis failure bull sustain high show trader stuck higher level bailing position closer buyer fail break sustain attract profit booking drag level bear plummet fibonacci retracement level extend correction retracement recent rally breakdown level drag uptrend line upsloping line anticipate buying cryptocurrency corrects level trend changed trader dip buy contrary assumption bull propel digital currency retest breakout resume uptrend give probability occurring term trader wait buy dip chasing higher bnb usd binance planning launch future trading bitcoin leverage leverage experienced trader easily destroy novice trader judiciously leading cryptocurrency exchange switched tether deposit withdrawal address omni based address erc based address standard forward dogecoin doge price spurted higher announcement binance list fundamental remaining binance coin bnb resume uptrend cryptocurrencies struggling lifetime high made previous market bnb usd pair continues trade lifetime high sloping sma turning gradually positive sign show pair uptrend dip support level offer risk buying opportunity trader support downside support break fall extend uptrend line line anticipate buying support trader watch action mentioned level buy phased manner move low digital currency remain bound consolidate gain leg move start breakout utc time usd recently atlantis hard fork entered testing stage update scheduled lab metronome announced chainhop functionality enabled ethereum ethereum classic blockchains cryptocurrency backed positive news fundamental front chart recovery usd pair hit show profit booking higher level positive bull pullback rebound bull push resistance zone start uptrend trader buy part intended position size add rest breakout conversely bear pair slip suggest trader wait break initiating fresh position xrp usd xpring ripple ecosystem initiative claim committed xrp project company goal support project create case ripple xrp token chart project xrp usd pair laggard recent recovery crypto price bull repeatedly failed sustain show lack demand higher level pair taking support closer moving average located level important support watch bounce support bull attempt scale overhead resistance zone anticipate digital currency start uptrend pick momentum sustains break moving average slide breakdown support zone hugely negative cryptocurrency stuck inside approach stay neutral start uptrend notwithstanding trader trade strategy buy closer support resistance market data provided hitbtc exchange,0.04773689273689273,positive,0.3845262145262146,"{'neg': 0.088, 'neu': 0.745, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9942}",0.9942,0.088,0.745,0.166,positive,-0.06122448854643901,0.0917602994536324,negative
binance,Markets,Binance Destroys $26 Million Worth of Its Team's BNB Tokens,"Binance, the world's top exchange by trading volume, says it has completed the eight quarterly ""burn"" of Binance coin (BNB) tokens. The exchange  posted  Friday that the burn – the industry term for destroying tokens –  comes in accordance with its white paper and involved 808,888 BNB previously allocated to the Binance team. The amount was worth around $23.8 million, Binance said, though CoinDesk found the total higher at $26.4 million at time of writing. At press time, BNB was worth almost $32, up 5.95 percent over 24 hours, according to  CoinMarketCap . The burn transaction can be seen  here  and in the image below. ""Starting with this burn, Binance will relinquish the BNB tokens allocated to the Binance team and contribute this BNB towards our commitment to burning a total of 100 million BNB,"" said the exchange. Binance indicated that the team's 80,000,000 BNB allocated tokens make up 40 percent of the total BNB supply.   

In a  blog post  on the burn, the firm said the tokens had been allocated to ""reward to the work they have put into building the Binance ecosystem.""

 ""The eventual total supply of BNB will still be 100,000,000 BNB. The current total supply of BNB is 189,000,000 BNB, which means that 89,000,000 BNB still need to be burned,"" said the firm, adding: ""The team will burn off the 80,000,000 BNB team allocation first, and the remaining 9,000,000 BNB will be burned by Binance.com exchange."" CoinDesk reached out to ask if the team will in some way compensated for relinquishing the millions in BNB.

binance, News , Pundi X Integrates Crypto Payments Into Traditional Sales Terminals ,"Cryptocurrency payments startup Pundi X announced that it has integrated its crypto payments system into a device made by American point-of-sale (POS) systems producer VeriFone in a  press release  July 12. 
 Per the release, the startup has integrated its XPOS crypto payments module on the X990 Android-based POS terminal by VeriFone, which is reportedly one of the world’s major producers of such devices. The initiative aims to allow a wider network of retailers to accept payments in cryptocurrencies. The startup states: 
 “With this integration, shops and retail outlets using the VeriFone X990 with XPOS module activated will now be able to process cryptocurrency payments alongside traditional transactions.” 
 The XPOS-enabled devices will support payments in Bitcoin ( BTC ), Ether ( ETH ), Binance Coin ( BNB ), KuCoin Shares ( KCS ), Kyber Network ( KNC ), Nem ( XEM ) and Pundi X ( NPXS ). The device will automatically exchange between fiat and cryptocurrencies during the transactions, which can be made with Pundi XPASS cards or the XWallet app. 
 According to the press release, VeriFone has over 35 million devices in more than 150 countries. Crunchbase estimates the firm’s revenue to be $1.8 billion annually. 
 In June last year, Pundi X  began  rolling out its cryptocurrency POS devices in Indonesia, betting that the central bank would discard its anti-cryptocurrency stance within three years.

binance, Market Analysis ," Top 5 Crypto Performers: BTC, LINK, XMR, BNB, XLM ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. Update, July 14 : This article has been redacted to remove a featured coin. The total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies has dipped below $300 billion from over  $380 billion  on June 26. This shows that the sharp recovery from the lows is taking a breather. While the unveiling of Facebook’s Libra project was a major boost to cryptocurrencies, the recent  opposition  to it from  various  quarters has led to profit booking.  While a number of altcoins have hit a rough patch and have given up the majority of their gains accrued over the past few weeks, Bitcoin is still looking strong. Hence, we view this fall as a buying opportunity. However, we do not suggest buying when the trend is down. Traders can wait for the price to stop falling and form a short-term bottom before initiating long positions. The rally after the current corrective phase will clearly separate the winners from the losers. We suggest traders look to buy cryptocurrencies that have held above their strong supports and are quick to bounce back from the fall. Let’s see if we spot any trading opportunities in the top five performers of the past seven days. BTC/USD A number of big names spoke against Bitcoin ( BTC ) in the past week. The most important statement was from United States president Donald Trump who said that he was  not a fan  of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as he believed that it was not money, highly volatile and its value was “based on thin air.” However, the crypto community took this statement as a huge  positive  because it gave wide publicity to the asset class and showed that it has become so important that the U.S. president would comment on it. The Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said that no one used Bitcoin for payments and it was only a “ speculative  store of value like gold.” The European Central Bank also voiced its opposition and said that Bitcoin was not a currency but a  volatile  asset, hence, it did not have any plans to add Bitcoin to its reserves. On the other hand, Chamath Palihapitiya, CEO of VC firm Social Capital, said that Bitcoin is the  best  hedge against the traditional financial system. Similarly, Grayscale Bitcoin Trust showed a considerable  inflow  of funds. This shows that while the central banks and world leaders continue to voice their opposition to Bitcoin, it is finding a place in the portfolio of large investors. So, should traders buy now or wait for lower levels? Let’s find out. The recovery in the BTC/USD pair hit a barrier at $13,156.96 and turned down from there. It can now correct to the first support of $9,781.81, which is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement of the recent rally. If this support holds, it will indicate that bulls are not willing to wait for lower levels to buy, which is a positive sign. The next rally is likely to retest $13,973.50. On the other hand, if bears sink the price below $9,871.81, the next support is at the 50% retracement level of $8,604.80. The 20-week EMA is also close to it, hence, we expect a rebound from one of the supports. As the RSI is still in overbought territory, the pair might not run up in a hurry. It might consolidate for a few weeks before resuming the up-move. We will wait for the price to complete the correction and show signs of a turnaround before suggesting a trade in it. LINK/USD Chain Link ( Link ) announced a  collaboration  with IoTeX on oracle research and development to provide real-world data to blockchain applications. It also tied up with  Ampleforth  and  Neblio  in the past seven days.  The sharp rally in the LINK/USD pair could not sustain above $4. In the past two weeks, the pair corrected to $2.60, which is just above the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $2.4465. As the RSI is still deep in overbought territory, we expect the price to enter into a range for a few weeks. Contrary to our assumption, if bears sink the digital currency below $2.4665, it can drop to $1.9671, which is the 61.80% Fibonacci retracement of the rally. A breakdown of this support will be a negative move. We suggest traders wait for the formation of a clear range before initiating long positions. XMR/USD Though Monero ( XMR ) fell over 10% in the past seven days, it was the third-best performer. It has been a consistent performer in the past few weeks. Can it keep up the momentum and move up or will it enter a corrective phase? Let’s look at the charts.   Contrary to our assumption, the rebound in the XMR/USD pair hit a wall at $108.840. The price has turned down sharply and is retesting the critical support at $81. This is a bearish sign. Both the moving averages and the horizontal support are located at this level, hence, we anticipate a strong defense by the bulls. If successful, we might see another attempt by the bulls to propel the price towards $120. However, if the digital currency plunges below $81, it can drop to the next support at $60.147. Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests consolidation in the short term. The traders can retain the stop loss on the  long  positions at $78. BNB/USD The world’s leading cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the  launch  of margin trading with its 2.0 platform. Though margin trading is risky, with proper risk management, it can be a boon to the experienced trader. Novices, however, should stay away from margin trading. The exchange  announced  support to additional pairs on its fiat-enabled trading platform in Singapore. Its research arm said that merged mining can  mitigate  the effects of halvings for Bitcoin and Litecoin. How does Binance Coin’s ( BNB ) chart look? The BNB/USD pair continues to be strong with both the moving averages sloping up and the RSI still in the positive territory. The bulls held the first support of $28.7168 during the week, which is also a positive sign. They will now attempt a recovery from the current levels. If the support holds, the pair might remain range-bound for a few weeks. However, if the rebound fizzles out and the pair plunges below $28.7168, it can correct to the uptrend line. The 20-week EMA is also located at this level, hence, we expect the bulls to defend this support. Traders can watch this level closely and initiate long positions on a strong bounce off it, but should stay away if this support cracks. XLM/USD Stellar ( XLM ) again climbed back into the list of top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in the past week. The list of winners of the  first  Stellar Community Fund was announced on July 9. Can the digital currency maintain its spot in the top ten or will it correct and lose its spot? The XLM/USD pair has dropped to the bottom of $0.0850–$0.1450 range. The 20-week EMA has started to slope down and the RSI is back in the negative territory, which suggests that the bears are back in action. A breakdown of the range can result in a retest of the lows. The pair will become very negative if the bears sink the price to new yearly lows.  However, if the price rebounds off the support of $0.085, bulls will attempt to push it back towards the top of the range at $0.01450. Traders should wait for the price to show a strong bounce before entering a trade in it.

binance,Markets,South Korean Crypto Exchange Signs With Security Companies to Lock Down Tokens,"Coinone has signed deals with CertiK and Xangle to improve security and enhance disclosure, according to an  announcement from the company. The number three Korean crypto exchange says that it will be working with Xangle on investor protection and project transparency. With CertiK, it will be focused on the security of the code, technology verification, and project information security. The moves come as crypto exchanges are the subject of heightened scrutiny in South Korea and globally. With concerns about money laundering and with FATF guidelines beginning to have an impact, banking relationships are being tested and financial institutions in Seoul are refining their KYC programs and processes. Just today, it was reported that the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) is  planning to directly supervise  the exchanges. With concerns about hacking on the rise, Korea's Fair Trade Commission (FTC) in June called for a change in the terms and conditions of use for crypto exchanges, requiring the exchanges themselves to accept liability for any losses from theft. Bithumb, the second largest exchange in South Korea, suffered two hacks in one year, losing more than $50 million in the process. Coinone itself was raided in early 2018, along with Bithumb, by the South Korean tax authorities. A report in the local Korea press says that one of the concerns for Coinone is the possibility that the coins themselves could introduce viruses into the exchange and allow for the hacking of it. New York-based CertiK, founded in 2017, led by two academics and with investment from Binance Labs and Consensus Labs, specializes in the 'verifying' of blockchains and smart contracts. It says that what it does is beyond a simple audit. It is a formal verification, whereby programs are mathematically tested and proven. CertiK is already quite active in South Korea. In June, it signed a deal with FLETA, a local blockchain platform. The goal of the partnership is to strengthen the company's systems and help secure other elements of its ecosystem. CertiK also conducted an audit of Terra,  publishing a report  on the stablecoin on May 4. Xangle is a Seoul-based crypto currency disclosure platform.

The intervening period had seen bearish moves for BTC/USD, with upward momentum running out of steam to take markets as low as $9,300.  “Favorable macroeconomic fundamentals — plunging bond yields and rising stock-market volatility — appear to have endurance and should further differentiate Bitcoin from other crypto assets,”  Bloomberg  quoted its own analyst, Mike McGlone, as saying while reporting the GTI data Tuesday. Other figures delivered similar appraisals of the current market, including  Anthony Pompliano , who this week forecast further reductions in global interest rates could trigger fresh demand for Bitcoin as a safe haven bet. “Central banks around the world are slashing interest rates. Soon they'll start printing egregious amounts of money. Bitcoin halving approaching quickly. Buckle up. This may get insane,” he wrote on Twitter. Technical analysts were also buoyant, Cointelegraph noting that daily commentators such as  Josh Rager  no longer felt threatened by the likelihood of BTC/USD falling into the $9,000 zone again.

binance, News , Binance Coin Soars 12% After KYC Leak ‘FUD’ Fails to Shake Investors ,"The native token of crypto exchange Binance has soared ~11% despite fresh rumors of a possible Know-Your-Customer (KYC) data leak affecting exchange users. According to data from CoinMarketCap as of press time, Binance Coin ( BNB ) is up 10.7% on the day to trade at $30.59. “@kycisimportant” Telegram group apparently deleted As reported yesterday, Binance has this week been at the center of a social media furor surrounding an alleged KYC data leak involving the personal documents of Binance users. A dedicated Telegram group — now apparently deleted as of press time — was created by social media user “@kycisimportant” and included materials allegedly leaked from the exchange’s internal KYC verification database. The images notably lacked the digital watermark used by the platform for its in-house data, casting some doubt on their authenticity. As the controversy unfolded — with at least 8,300 members having the group — Binance revealed it was already investigating the incident, noting that its initial review suggested the leaked materials dated back to February 2018 when Binance had outsourced its KYC processes to a third-party vendor. Third-party tools on the exchange were notably  hacked  in early March of that year.   With ongoing uncertainty as to the legitimacy of the apparent leak, Binance has cautioned against sinking into FUD — fear, uncertainty and doubt — and revealed that an anonymous individual had threatened and harassed the exchange, demanding 300 BTC in exchange for withholding 10,000 photos that bear similarity to Binance KYC data. Doubts linger but investors stay keen But fears from yesterday’s alleged KYC leak appear to have subsided. BNB currently ranked 6th largest coin by market cap and seeing a yet greater boost — at 9.1% on the day by press time — on the BNB/BTC charts. The exchange has recently been building out its infrastructure and trading offerings, adding  support  for multiple decentralized exchanges (DEX) to its Trust Wallet,  launching  proprietary fiat-pegged stablecoins and  introducing  margin trading on its flagship exchange.  Some users have proposed that BNB’s bullish performance has been spurred by the new  listing  of multiple native stablecoins on Binance DEX.  The exchange suffered a high-profile  hack  resulting in the loss of over $40 million this May.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-coin-soars-12-after-kyc-leak-fud-fails-to-shake-investors,cointelegraph,2019-08-08,00:00:00,en,366,2335,5.33879781420765,130,0.3551912568306011,native token crypto exchange binance soared fresh rumor customer kyc data affecting exchange user data coinmarketcap press time binance coin bnb trade kycisimportant telegram group apparently deleted reported yesterday binance center social medium furor surrounding alleged kyc data involving personal document binance user dedicated telegram group apparently deleted press time created social medium user kycisimportant included material allegedly leaked exchange internal kyc verification database image notably lacked digital watermark platform data casting doubt authenticity controversy unfolded member group binance revealed investigating incident noting initial review suggested leaked material dated binance outsourced kyc process party vendor party tool exchange notably hacked ongoing uncertainty legitimacy apparent binance cautioned sinking fud fear uncertainty doubt revealed anonymous individual threatened harassed exchange demanding btc exchange withholding photo similarity binance kyc data doubt linger investor stay yesterday alleged kyc subsided bnb ranked largest coin market cap greater boost press time bnb btc chart exchange recently building infrastructure trading offering adding support multiple decentralized exchange dex trust wallet launching proprietary fiat pegged stablecoins introducing margin trading flagship exchange user proposed bnb bullish performance spurred listing multiple native stablecoins binance dex exchange suffered profile resulting loss,0.07698412698412697,positive,0.21587301587301586,"{'neg': 0.171, 'neu': 0.718, 'pos': 0.111, 'compound': -0.91}",-0.91,0.171,0.718,0.111,negative,-0.8095237709750585,0.11797752742709254,negative
binance, Follow up ," Binance KYC Breach — Did It Happen, and If So, Who’s to Blame? ","On Aug. 7,  Binance , the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange (by daily trade volume), fell victim to a  hacking  scandal that saw the miscreant allegedly gain  possession  of a huge chunk of the firm’s Know Your Customer ( KYC ) data (10,000+ personal photos). The hacker is reportedly demanding a total of 300  Bitcoins  (worth around $3.5 million) from the exchange, or else he or she will release all of the data. 
 Also, it bears mentioning that upon commencing his activities, the  hacker  set up a couple of dedicated Telegram groups (which have since been  shut down ) that allegedly featured a lot of the sensitive material. However, since all of this data lacked a digital watermark that Binance typically uses for its internal information, there are doubts regarding the authenticity of this material. On the subject, Binance’s security team had the following  comment : 
 “At the present time, no evidence has been supplied that indicates any KYC images have been obtained from Binance, as these images do not contain the digital watermark imprinted by our system.” 
 Binance claims that the images released thus far can be dated back to February, a time when the premier trading platform was making use of a third-party service provider to process its KYC verifications. Similarly, the exchange reportedly also asked the hacker to provide them with more information regarding the source of this KYC data, but the individual simply demanded 300 BTC and refused to give the team any irrefutable evidence. 
 At this point, some are questioning if Binance may be trying to absolve itself of any wrongdoing in the matter by somewhat  deflecting the blame  toward the third-party vendor managing the company’s KYC info at the time. Cointelegraph spoke to independent  crypto  author and analyst Sam Town, who pointed out: 
 “KYC data should be — and is — currently handled in-house by major exchanges. We may be more than a decade post-Satoshi, but the cryptocurrency ecosystem is still a work in progress. Stop-gap solutions like third party KYC data management may be necessary to bootstrap a platform, but that doesn't absolve Binance of responsibility in this case.” 
 A similar sentiment is also shared by Paul Bischoff, editor at Comparitech, who agrees that even companies and  governments  are routinely blamed for errors made by their contractors and affiliates, and Binance therefore bears a huge chunk of the responsibility in relation to this entire episode — if the data turns out to be genuine. 
 Binance is talking active remedial measures to stop the bleeding 
 As part of the firm’s damage-control measures, Binance’s security team is offering a reward of 25 Bitcoins to any person who can supply them with pertinent information that can help in the arrest of the hacker/hackers behind this incident. And while all of this may sound fine, it is hard to avoid the fact that the leading crypto exchange also fell victim to another  hacking scandal  this past May, which saw the company lose around 7,000 Bitcoin (worth around $40 million at the time of the hack). At the time, many people predicted that the incident would have an irreparable impact on the company’s image. However, Binance’s performance has only continued to improve ever since.

 In this regard, following this latest data breach, the price of Binance Coin ( BNB ) — the premier crypto exchange’s native digital currency — has  soared  by over 12%, thereby indicating that the global  crypto community  doesn't seem to care all that much about this possible  security  mishap. On the subject, Town bluntly notes: 
 “Over 500,000 Facebook users had their private data — including ID details and location data — leaked in April this year. The Cambridge Analytica saw the private data of 87 million Facebook users exploited in early 2018. Did anybody really care? Did anybody stop using Facebook? Bithumb lost $30 million in a hack in June — it still turns over $700 million in daily volume and ranks in the top 30 exchanges. Nobody cares enough about data privacy for the Binance KYC ‘hack’ to matter.” 
 It is also worth mentioning that soon after the incident came to light, the CEO of Binance,   Changpeng Zhao  (aka CZ), took to Twitter to tell his followers that they should not fall into the “KYC leak” FUD. However, this remark does not seem to address the heart of the issue: If it’s true that sensitive KYC data was leaked online, it puts a lot of people’s  privacy  and digital security at risk.  
 If the stolen data turns out to be real, the 10K+ leaked images in question could be worth a lot of money to various criminals. Bischoff points out that they could potentially be used by miscreants to bypass two-factor  authentication  measures, or even facilitate a variety of bank drop  scams . In a recent  article , Bischoff wrote at length about how passport images and scans are regularly used by nefarious, third-party agents to carry out their illegal activities. Not only that, leaked KYC data is often used to create fake IDs and passports, which  can be sold  for as much as $1,500.  
 Lastly, according to various unconfirmed reports, it  does not seem  as though the actions of the hacker(s) are an attempt to spread any FUD regarding Binance, but rather he/she seems to be motivated by the Bitcoin ransom alone. Cointelegraph reached out to Binance for comment, but the exchange representative said that no further information is available. 
 Another side of the story emerges 
 All of the information that Binance and various credible  media  sources have provided has already been discussed at this point. However, if certain theories are to be believed, a hacker by the name of Bnatov Platon could be behind this entire ordeal. It is alleged that Platon offered to assist Binance when the exchange was hacked back in May. He was apparently able to track the people who stole the 7,000 BTC from the premier trading platform as well recover over 60,000 KYC files associated with the company’s customer base. 
 Related:  Funds Are SAFU, but Reorg Is Not: What We Know About the Binance Hack So Far 
 Platon claims that the hacker(s) could gain access to all of this information by infiltrating the account of a company insider who allegedly installed a back door into Binance’s trading module (via  API  keys) — thereby allowing the hacker(s) to make off with the aforementioned sum of crypto. 
 However, this is where matters get interesting. Platon — who refers to himself as a “white hacker” — allegedly demanded a reward of 300 Bitcoins from Binance in return for providing the company with details of the intruders, including their names, phone numbers, photos, server data and correspondence. But when representatives working for the exchange did not grant his request for a reward, he released the KYC details of more than 600 Binance customers via different Telegram groups. In relation to the matter, Platon reportedly  added : 
 “When I require money, I can just hack out one exchange account balance (hacker’s). I could retrieve more than 600 or 700 coins easily by hacking the hacker’s wallet. [...] My decision for negotiation with Binance was wrong. They are not the right people… so I will just publish all of the data.” 
 Lastly, Platon also claims to have tracked the bulk of the laundered Bitcoins that were stolen from the exchange back in May. According to him, at least 2,000 of these coins were sent to various wallet addresses via different exchanges, including  Bitmex , Yobit, KuCoin and  Huobi . He now claims to have plans of publishing all of the data he has under his control across various public domains. 
 In relation to the matter, we reached out to Benjamin Pirus, the host of a  podcast  called “Crypto: Secrets of the Trade.” He believes that the narrative including Platon is quite compelling and is definitely worth investigating further. When asked about what the best way for CZ to tackle this situation would be, Pirus responded by saying: 
 “I think it really depends on how Binance deals with the situation in the coming days. CZ has done a decent job over the past two years in handling difficulties, especially considering the exchange’s rapid growth. I hope the authorities will be able to work with Binance to solve the issue, in line with proper laws and regulations.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-kyc-breach-did-it-happen-and-if-so-whos-to-blame,cointelegraph,2019-08-10,00:00:00,en,1402,8399,4.919400855920114,574,0.4094151212553495,binance world largest cryptocurrency exchange trade volume victim hacking scandal miscreant allegedly gain possession huge chunk firm customer kyc data personal photo reportedly demanding total bitcoins exchange release data bear mentioning commencing activity set couple dedicated telegram group shut allegedly featured lot sensitive material data lacked digital watermark binance typically internal information doubt authenticity material subject binance security team comment present time evidence supplied kyc image obtained binance image digital watermark imprinted system binance claim image released dated time premier trading platform making party service provider process kyc verification similarly exchange reportedly asked provide information source kyc data individual simply demanded btc refused give team irrefutable evidence point questioning binance absolve wrongdoing matter deflecting blame party vendor managing company kyc info time cointelegraph spoke independent crypto author analyst town pointed kyc data handled exchange decade satoshi cryptocurrency ecosystem work progress stop gap solution party kyc data management bootstrap platform absolve binance responsibility similar sentiment shared editor comparitech agrees company government routinely blamed error made contractor affiliate binance bear huge chunk responsibility relation entire episode data turn genuine binance talking active remedial measure stop bleeding part firm damage control measure binance security team offering reward bitcoins supply pertinent information arrest hacker incident sound hard avoid fact leading crypto exchange victim hacking scandal past company lose bitcoin time time people predicted incident irreparable impact company image binance performance continued improve bnb chart onward source coin regard latest data breach binance coin bnb premier crypto exchange native digital currency soared indicating global crypto community care security mishap subject town bluntly note facebook user private data including id detail location data leaked cambridge analytica private data facebook user exploited care stop facebook bithumb lost turn volume rank top exchange care data privacy binance kyc matter mentioning incident ceo binance changpeng aka cz twitter follower fall kyc fud remark address heart issue sensitive kyc data leaked online put lot people privacy digital security risk stolen data turn leaked image question lot criminal point potentially miscreant bypass factor authentication measure facilitate variety bank drop scam recent article wrote length passport image scan regularly nefarious party agent illegal activity leaked kyc data create fake id passport sold lastly unconfirmed report action attempt spread fud binance motivated bitcoin cointelegraph reached binance comment exchange representative information side emerges information binance credible medium source provided discussed point theory believed bnatov platon entire ordeal alleged platon offered assist binance exchange hacked apparently track people stole btc premier trading platform recover kyc file company customer base related fund safu reorg binance platon claim gain access information infiltrating account company insider allegedly installed door binance trading module api allowing make aforementioned sum crypto matter interesting platon refers allegedly demanded reward bitcoins binance return providing company detail intruder including name phone photo server data correspondence representative working exchange request reward released kyc detail binance customer telegram group relation matter platon reportedly added require exchange account balance retrieve coin easily hacking wallet decision negotiation binance wrong people publish data lastly platon claim tracked bulk laundered bitcoins stolen exchange coin wallet address exchange including bitmex yobit kucoin huobi claim plan publishing data control public domain relation matter reached pirus host podcast called crypto secret trade belief narrative including platon compelling investigating asked cz tackle situation pirus responded depends binance deal situation coming day cz decent job past year handling difficulty exchange rapid growth authority work binance solve issue line proper regulation,-0.023205128205128205,negative,0.3948830656522965,"{'neg': 0.148, 'neu': 0.702, 'pos': 0.15, 'compound': -0.1531}",-0.1531,0.148,0.702,0.15,neutral,-0.4285714217687076,0.11864406757317501,negative

binance, Market Analysis ," Top-5 Crypto Performers: BNB, BTC, XMR, LEO, DASH ","The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision. The market data is provided by the  HitBTC  exchange. About 15 countries, including the G-7 nations, have agreed to create a new  system  to share personal data of cryptocurrency users to keep a check on money laundering and other illegal activities. The Financial Action Task Force, an international organization comprising more than 30 member countries and economies, is likely to design the system and come up with detailed measures by 2020. While curbing the illegal use of cryptocurrencies is positive, central banks and regulators keep neglecting the various problems that cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology plan to address. However, even with all the resistance, spending on blockchain solutions is likely to reach almost  $16 billion  in 2023, according to a report by United States-based market research firm International Data Corporation. This amounts to a five-year compound annual growth rate of 60.2% between 2018–2023, which is a huge positive.  While Bitcoin is a big beneficiary during times of geopolitical tensions and trade wars, several altcoins are likely to benefit from specific use cases. Let’s look at the top five performers of the past seven days and see if we spot any bullish patterns on the chart. BNB/USD Binance was in the thick of news last week on reports of a Know Your Customer data  leak . Though Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted not to fall for the FUD, the exchange did not give any firm news on whether the leak had happened. They believe that the  leaked  images did not have a watermark that Binance uses for its KYC documents. According to them, the photos are from a period when the exchange was using a third-party service provider to process its KYC verifications.  However, this news did not cause any damage to the price of Binance Coin ( BNB ) and it turned out to be the best performer of the week. In other news, Binance US is planning to add about 30 digital assets for its US customers. With mixed news, what does the chart project? The trend in the BNB/USD pair is up. The correction that started at $39.5941 found buyers at $24.1709. The price did not close (UTC time) below the 20-week EMA, which is a positive sign. Currently, bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend, but are facing resistance at the uptrend line. The trend is weakening as seen by the flattening slope of the 20-week EMA. The RSI, though in positive territory, has been gradually falling towards the center. This shows hesitation among buyers at higher levels.  If bears break below $24.1709, the pair will enter a downtrend and might correct to $18.30. However, if the support at $24.1709 holds, a range-bound action might ensue. The uptrend will resume if bulls sustain the price above the uptrend line. In such a case, a rally to $39.5931 is probable. Therefore, traders can buy above $32 and keep an initial stop loss of $24.  BTC/USD Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance reached  69.92 % on Aug. 10, which shows that traders are preferring the leading cryptocurrency over altcoins. Former Wall Street trader Max Keiser believes that Bitcoin’s dominance will reach  80%  as altcoins fall to the wayside. During the recent escalation of trade war between the U.S. and China, Bitcoin has emerged as a  safe haven  asset along with gold. Billionaire investor Mark Cuban said that he  views  both gold and Bitcoin as “being the same thing.”  The cryptocurrency might gain a further foothold in the event of a  no-deal  Brexit. Serial VC investor Tim Draper has said that the current consolidation might delay the rally in Bitcoin, but he expects his target of  $250,000  to be hit by 2023. Will Bitcoin enter a consolidation or break out of the recent highs? Let’s analyze the charts. The failure of bulls to sustain above the downtrend line is a negative sign. It shows a lack of demand at higher levels. However, the trend remains up and every dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity until the price remains above the 20-week EMA.  If the price rises and sustains above the downtrend line within the next couple of weeks, we anticipate a rally to the recent highs of $13,973.50. A breakout of this resistance will trigger FOMO and a quick move to $17,208.84 will be in the cards. Contrary to our assumption, if the BTC/USD pair reverses direction from current levels and plummets below the 20-week EMA, it will signal profit booking by bulls and selling by bears. It will also indicate a change in trend. The next level to watch below the 20-week EMA is $7,451.63.  XMR/USD The malware Smominru, which was previously used to mine Monero ( XMR ) on over half a million infected computers, has now been  updated  to steal system access information for possible sale on the dark web, according to a report by cybersecurity company Carbon Black. Though it has held up quite well in the past seven days, can the digital currency build on its gains or will it falter? Let’s look at the chart. The XMR/USD pair rallied above the 20-week EMA, but could not reach our first target of $107. It is facing selling at $98.2939. If the price bounces off the 20-week EMA, we anticipate bulls to again attempt to propel the price above $98.2939. Above this level, the next level to watch is $107 and above it $120. Conversely, if the price dips below the 20-week EMA, but stays above $81.4151, it will remain range-bound for a few weeks. Flat moving averages and the RSI just above 50 also points to consolidation. The trend will turn negative on a breakdown of the critical support of $81.4151. Below this level, a drop to $60 and lower is possible. However, we give this a low probability of occurring. LEO/USD UNUS SED LEO (LEO) turned out to be the fourth-best performer of the past seven days. Bitfinex and Tether’s legal  battle  against the New York State Office of the Attorney General (OAG) has been extended as Justice Joel M. Cohen of the New York Supreme Court has given more time to the OAG to investigate the case.  We will analyze the daily chart of the LEO/USD pair because of its short trading history. The pair has been stuck inside a range of $1.20 to $1.40 since Jul. 17. Currently, the price has bounced off the support at $1.20 and is attempting to rise above the 20-day EMA. If successful, it can move up to $1.40. The 50-day SMA is just above this level. Once bulls scale above the 50-day SMA, a rally to $1.80 and above it to $2 is possible. Conversely, if the price fails to scale above $1.40, the range bound action between $1.20 and $1.40 will continue for a few more days. However, if the pair reverses direction from the current level and plunges below $1.20, it can correct to the lows at $1.0384. We suggest that traders wait for the price to break out and sustain above the 50-day SMA before turning positive.  DASH/USD Dash ( DASH ) rounds up the top five performers of the past seven days. Major crypto platform Coinbase announced that it is considering  support  for eight new digital assets, including DASH. While this fundamental news is positive, how does its chart stack up? Let’s take a look. Though the DASH/USD pair has stayed above the immediate support of $95.4264 for the past three weeks, bulls have not been able to achieve a strong bounce off it. This shows a lack of urgency among buyers to load up on the cryptocurrency at current levels. The price has been trading below both moving averages for the past four weeks and the RSI is in the negative zone, which is a bearish sign. Unless the price quickly rises above the moving averages, we expect bears to attempt a breakdown of $95.4264. The next support on the downside is at $86.3249, which is the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from the lows. If this support breaks, a retest of the yearly lows will be in the cards. Conversely, if the bulls succeed in propelling the pair above both moving averages, we expect a rally to $160 and above it to $188.5598. We suggest traders wait for the price to rise above both moving averages before initiating long positions.

binance,Markets,SEC Settles With ICO Service Over Undisclosed Payments for Reviews,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has fined Russia-based analytics firm ICORating for failure to disclose payments for positive reviews to various projects. Today the SEC  announced  a $268,998 settlement with ICORating for projects rated from December 2017 through July 2018. According to the SEC, projects rated by ICORating during that time raised funds through particular initial coin offerings which the SEC classifies as securities. As such, proper disclosures should have been made to potential investors. A platform for rating investments in ICO-based projects, ICORating  lists  multiple team members from prominent cryptocurrency projects like NEO. No company members were charged in the SEC settlement. In a statement, Melissa Hodgman, Associate Director of the SEC’s Enforcement Division said ICORating violated Section 17(b) of the Securities Act of 1933: “The securities laws require promoters, including both people and entities, to disclose compensation they receive for touting investments so that potential investors are aware they are viewing a paid promotional item. This requirement applies regardless of whether the securities being touted are issued using traditional certificates or on the blockchain.” ICORating agreed to pay $106,998 in interest and a civil penalty of $162,000 without commenting on the SEC’s findings. August has proven to be a busy month for the U.S. regulator. Last week, the SEC  charged  New England-based SimplyVital Health for failing to register a $6.3 million ether (ETH) pre-sale of its HLTH tokens. On August 13, the SEC took action against two other ICO-based projects,  PlexCorps  and  Reggie Middleton of Veritaseum .

binance, News , Binance Unveils Its First Crypto Lending Service Launching This Month ,"Major crypto exchange Binance will launch its first crypto lending product on Aug. 28, 2019. According to an official  announcement  on Aug. 26, holders of Binance Coin ( BNB ), Ethereum Classic ( ETC ) and Tether ( USDT ) will be able to lend their assets and earn interest through Binance’s new service called Binance Lending. The services will be available for  subscription  from Aug. 28 till Aug. 29, Binance noted in the announcement. Lending products will have an initial 14-day period. BNB will have the highest annualized interest rate of 15% while the rates for USDT and ETC amount to 10% and 7%, respectively. Binance Lending table. Source:  Binance The first interest calculation period will be from Aug. 29 till Sept. 10. Binance added that interest payout time will take place immediately after the loan term matures. The annualized interest rates for upcoming phases will be adjusted based on market reception during this initial phase, the company stated. Binance gives an example: ""If User A subscribes to 10 lots of BNB Lending (total lend of 100 BNB), the interest earned at maturity date will be 0.057534 BNB x 10 = 0.57534 BNB.” Also today, Binance  updated  its Lending FAQ by adding a new section “Binance Lending Service Agreement,” claiming that the Binance Lending assets will be used in cryptocurrency leveraged borrowing business on Binance.com.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-unveils-its-first-crypto-lending-service-launching-this-month,cointelegraph,2019-08-26,00:00:00,en,226,1373,5.048672566371682,68,0.3008849557522124,crypto exchange binance launch crypto lending product official announcement holder binance coin bnb ethereum classic tether usdt lend asset earn interest binance service called binance lending service subscription till binance noted announcement lending product initial period bnb highest annualized interest rate rate usdt amount binance lending table source binance interest calculation period till binance added interest payout time immediately term matures annualized interest rate upcoming phase adjusted based market reception initial phase company stated binance user subscribes lot bnb lending total lend bnb interest earned maturity bnb bnb today binance updated lending faq adding section binance lending service agreement claiming binance lending asset cryptocurrency leveraged borrowing business binance,0.041666666666666664,positive,0.22916666666666666,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.791, 'pos': 0.209, 'compound': 0.9756}",0.9756,0.0,0.791,0.209,positive,0.33333322222225925,0.02912621330945424,positive
binance,Markets,Coinbase-Backed Nomics Launches Trading Transparency Product,"Bitwise’s ""Real Ten"" SEC cryptocurrency  report  continues to inspire integrity-centric products. Data firm  Nomics  announced Tuesday its ""Transparent Volume"" service which calculates the percentage of real volume traded on cryptocurrency exchanges. By tracking the amount of cryptocurrency moving through an exchange, Nomics claims it can empower investors in real-time. (Image via Nomics) Backed by notable investors like Coinbase Ventures and CoinDesk owner Digital Currency Group, the data provider launched in 2018. Much like Bitwise's report, Nomics’ transparency definition comes from the availability of granular historical trading data. Speaking with CoinDesk, CEO and co-founder Clay Collins pointed toward the regulatory hurdles lack of data transparency is creating: “We currently list 3,873 assets on Nomics (2,502 of which are actively traded). The cutoff to be in the top quartile of actively traded assets in terms of percent transparent volume is around 1 percent. That is, if you have over 1 percent transparent volume for your cryptoasset, you're in the top quartile.” Of the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, only binance coin has a transparency rating over 30 percent, Collins said. Providing an API service for institutional investors, Collins says Transparent Volume is for investors of all stripes. Pointing towards Bitwise’s example, which released its SEC study in March, Nomics says transparency is found in the data. ""Our transparent volume metric is intended to help institutions, state actors, and investors assess the percentage of reported trading volume for a given crypto asset that is auditable and transparent,"" a release said. Crypto data integrity continues to be an issue across the space. A  report  from CoinDesk in July showed the ease of one Moscow student faking trading volume for only a $15,000 fee. Like Nomics, data provider  Messari Crypto  launched a similar product – its ""Real 10"" 24-hour volume metric – last spring.

Crypto-mining malware campaigns climbed 29 percent from Q4 2018 to Q1 2019 according to the study. McAfee said the campaign was indiscriminate, with both Apple MacOS and Microsoft Windows systems seeing a rise in targeted attacks. Windows products were typically targeted through PowerShell, and interactive command line and automation engine that delegates administrative tasks to the computer itself. By using PowerShell, vulnerabilities in servers were exploited to mine the privacy coin monero. McAfee said the attack had worm capabilities, allowing it to jump from server to server. Malware program CookieMiner was used against MacOS systems to steal private account information stored on users' computers. McAfee said account holders in crypto services Binance, Bitstamp, Bittrex, Coinbase, MyEtherWallet and Poloniex all had personal information stolen. A  report  from the BBC earlier this week highlighted a monero crypto-jacking virus which successfully hacked 850,000 servers, mostly in Latin America.

binance,Markets,"China's Digital Currency Will Be Two-Tiered, Replace Cash: Binance","A new research  report  from crypto exchange Binance says China’s digital currency will most likely be a two-tiered system replacing notes and coins in circulation. The report, issued yesterday, claims the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) central bank digital currency (CBDC) will be backed 1:1 by renminbi fiat as well as follow a two-tiered structured system with the bank, commercial banks, and retail market participants. The first tier will connect the PBOC with commercial banks for currency issuance and redemption. The second layer will connect those commercial banks with the greater retail market. A technical roadmap – including the questioned use of blockchain technology – has yet to be published, Binance said. PBOC  image via Binance Binance claims the PBOC’s system could allow fund transfers without the need for a bank account. ""The end goal for the CBDC is to display a turnover rate as high as cash, while achieving 'manageable anonymity,'"" Binance says in the report. ""In other words, in the first-layer network of the CBDC, real-name institutions are expected to be registered while the transfer in the second-layer network would be anonymous from the perspective of users."" The two-tiered system could help the PBOC process as many as 300,000 transactions per second, currently not possible with blockchain technology. Binance said smart contract architecture has also been discussed. Under the Bank of International Settlements' money taxonomy, the PBOC's new digital currency could cover ""general-purpose, account-based"" money and central bank digital tokens (which in turn have their own general purpose and wholesale categories. Money Flower  via Binance  The PBOC’s CBDC is purposed with replacing China’s notes and coins in circulation, also known as the M0 money supply. In other words, the CBDC is not meant to replace funds within the central bank or money holding institutions. Binance listed retail payments, interbank clearing, and cross-border payments as practical reasons for replacing the M0 with a CBDC.

binance,Markets,Crypto and the Latency Arms Race: Towards Speed Bumps and OTC Trading,"Max Boonen is founder and CEO of  crypto trading firm B2C2 . This post is the first in a series of three that looks at high-frequency trading in the context of the evolution of crypto markets. Opinions expressed within are his own and do not reflect those of CoinDesk.  The following article originally appeared in Institutional Crypto by CoinDesk, a free weekly newsletter for institutional investors focused on crypto assets. You can  sign up here . Matthew Trudeau, chief strategy officer of ErisX, offered  a thoughtful response  last month to  a CoinDesk article  about high-frequency trading in crypto. In short, CoinDesk reported that features linked to high-frequency trading in conventional markets were making an entry on crypto exchanges and that this might be bad news for retail investors. While I agree with Trudeau that, in general, “automated market making and arbitrage strategies create greater efficiency in the market,” I disagree with his assertion that applying the conventional markets’ microstructure blueprint will improve liquidity in crypto. I will explain below that, pushed to their limit, the benefits of speed brought about by electronification actually impair market liquidity as they morph into latency arbitrage. It is inevitable that crypto markets become much faster, but there is a significant risk that some exchanges overshoot and end up hurting their customer base, re-learning the lessons of the conventional latency wars a little too late. Those who do will lose market share to electronic OTC liquidity providers and alternative microstructures, which I will present in this introductory post. A brief history of the latency arms race Starting in the mid 1990s, innovative firms such at GETCO revolutionised the US equity market by automating the process of market making, traditionally the remit of humans on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. Those new entrants started by scraping information from the exchanges’ websites, before the APIs and trading protocols that we now take for granted. Electronic trading firms quickly realised that faster participants would thrive. If new information originated in Chicago’s exchanges could be processed more rapidly, not only could a trading firm adjust its passive quotes there before everyone else, it could also trade against the stale orders of slower traders in New York who could not adjust their quotes in time, picking them off thanks to that speed advantage. This is known as latency arbitrage. Trudeau reproduces a great graph from a  2014 BlackRock paper , itself referencing a 2010 SEC review of market structure. At the time, it was becoming clear that passive market making, a socially useful (“constructive”) activity, and the by-product of aggressive latency arbitrage, were two sides of the same HFT coin. This dynamic started a frantic race to the bottom in terms of latencies, where HFT firms invested hundreds of millions of dollars first in low-latency software, followed by low-latency hardware (GPUs then FPGAs) and low-latency communication networks, such as dedicated “dark fibre” lines (Spread Networks, 2010) and radio-frequency towers (McKay Brothers, 2012). (Private networks already existed; the arrival of commercially available ones is used as a reference point.) Why is latency arbitrage harmful? Prices are formed by the interaction of liquidity providers and liquidity consumers or takers. Various types of takers operate on a spectrum between the latency-insensitive long-term investors, with horizons in months or years, to the fastest high-frequency takers who engage in latency arbitrage. The business model of liquidity providers is to bridge the gap in time between buyers and sellers. Without those market makers, investors would not be able to transact efficiently as buyers and sellers rarely wish to transact in opposite directions exactly at the same time. In fact, without an OTC market, how would they agree a price? Attempts to build investor-to-investor platforms in conventional markets have broadly failed. In compensation for taking the risk that prices may move, market makers endeavour to capture a spread. The spread set by the makers is paid by the takers and depends, inter alia, on volatility, volumes and, crucially, on the degree to which takers are on average informed about the direction of the market in the short-run (“toxicity”). Latency arbitrageurs are naturally informed about short-term direction, having witnessed price changes in another part of the market fractions of a second before others can. Market makers concern themselves with what the fair clearing price would be and how much spread is required to compensate for a given amount of risk. They employ quantitative techniques to refine and automate this process. Latency arbitrageurs are primarily attentive to the relative direction of related markets on short time horizons, and invest in speed technology first and foremost. Michael Lewis’ book,  Flash Boys , famously paints a rather negative picture of the HFT industry and its impact on investors. I happen to disagree with Michael Lewis – but critics of HFTs have a point. While automation in market making has reduced spreads significantly for retail investors compared to the pre-internet era, it is the winner-takes-all nature of the latency arms race that is damaging to liquidity past a certain point. The BlackRock chart presented earlier puts arbitrage on a spectrum from constructive statistical arbitrage to structural strategies that include latency arbitrage and worse, such as intentionally clogging up exchange data feeds with millions of orders to make it difficult for slower participants to process market data in real time. The problem with latency arbitrage is that it is now mostly a battle of financial clout. As exchange technology improved to keep up with electronification, the random delays in order processing times called “jitter” have gone down to virtually zero, meaning that whoever gets to the next exchange first is guaranteed to come out ahead. At zero jitter, it is not sufficient for a liquidity provider to compete even at the level of the millisecond; even a 1 microsecond delay means that the latency arbitrageur’s gain will be the market maker’s loss. While anyone can be fast, only one person can be the fastest. “A lot of the tech I’ve been building in the past five years has been about saving half a microsecond, equivalent to 500 nanoseconds,”  explains  CMT’s CTO Robert Walker. “That edge can be the difference between making money or trading everyone else’s exhaust fumes. It’s a winner-takes-all scenario.” Therefore, latency arbitrage is harmful because it leads to a situation of natural monopoly that hurts competition. End users pay the price via two transmission mechanisms. One, the latency race has resulted in making constructive passive strategies unprofitable at all but the highest frequencies, forcing market makers to invest in technology to compete on speeds that are irrelevant to actual investors, rather than on research to improve pricing models. This represents a barrier to entry that lowers competition and increases concentration. Virtu’s latest annual report indicates that it spent $176 million on “communication and data processing,” 14% of its 2018 trading revenue, a growing proportion. Secondly, liquidity providers quote wider spreads and reduce order sizes in order to recoup their expected losses against latency arbitrageurs; an effective subsidy from end users to the fastest aggressive strategies. Ironically, many high-frequency traders abhor the speed game. High-frequency trading firm XTX explained in a  comment to the CFTC  that “the race for speed in trading has reached an inflection point where the marginal cost of gaining an edge over other market participants, now measured in microseconds and nanoseconds, is harming liquidity consumers.” The latency problem is a prisoner’s dilemma that  leads to over-investment . “We would both be better off not spending millions of dollars on latency, but if you do invest and I don’t, then I lose for sure.” Latency arbitrageurs are sometimes market-making firms themselves that, having been forced to invest in speed, naturally start putting that expensive technology to more aggressive uses. Latency arbitrage is a behaviour; it does not map to a monolithic class of trading firms. Where does crypto stand today? Crypto trading is a web-based industry with broadly equal access. For now. The ethos of crypto is that anyone can participate, big or small. In my opinion, the ability for anyone to devise a trading strategy, connect to an exchange and give it a go is up there in the industry’s psyche with the motto “Be your own bank.” However, just as it happened to mining, trading professionally is rapidly becoming the preserve of the biggest firms. Today, most crypto exchanges are essentially websites. This is the only way to support many thousands of connections concurrently and maintain equal access. The nature of web technology means that “jitter” cannot be reduced much – the web is parallel, not single-thread. This acts as a natural barrier against latency arbitrageurs: a single-digit millisecond latency advantage in getting from Binance to Bitstamp is less advantageous if the internals of the exchange add a random jitter of several milliseconds. Below is a sample of latencies, in milliseconds, seen by B2C2 on a well-known crypto exchange over a period of 5 minutes: Because it is not possible to run a low-latency, low-jitter exchange in a web infrastructure, combining the two implies that access must be tiered – with the result that only specialist firms such as B2C2 will benefit from the fastest, most expensive connectivity options. Note that the main tech problem faced by crypto exchanges is one of concurrent connections at peak load, when crypto is on the move and thousands upon thousands of users suddenly connect simultaneously. Compare to Amazon’s website around Christmas, not to the NYSE; the NYSE does not see a 10x increase in connected users when stocks are volatile. The main complaint that traders have against BitMEX, arguably the most successful crypto exchange, is not about latency but that the exchange rejects orders under heavy load. The first exchange to offer a co-location service was OKCoin in 2014, although it is said that no one actually used the service. Newer exchanges that hoped to attract institutional traders are more likely to offer co-location, or at least bells and whistles such as FIX connections: that is the case at Gemini, itBit and ErisX. Unsurprisingly, conventional venues such as the CME offer such services for their crypto offering by way of business. To this day, several crypto exchanges are investing in speed technology in order to court new types of users. In the short run, perhaps the next 12 months, it is likely that latencies will shrink significantly in crypto. To conjure an informed view of the longer term, though, we need to look at what is happening right now in conventional markets, which we will do in the next installment.

binance,Markets,Coinbase May Soon Launch an Initial Exchange Offering Platform,"San Francisco-based cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase may soon launch an initial exchange offering platform (IEO), according to Coinbase’s head of institutional sales in Asia, Kayvon Pirestani. Speaking on a panel Wednesday about the evolution of cryptocurrency capital formation at CoinDesk’s Invest: Asia conference, Pirestani said an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform is one of several capital-formation tools currently being explored by Coinbase. “We think there’s a really interesting opportunity there for Coinbase,” said Pirestani, adding: “In a nutshell, Coinbase is carefully exploring not only the IEO space but also STOs [security token offerings]. But I can’t make any formal announcements right now.” IEOs have already been supported by most other major exchanges including  Bitfinex, Binance, OKEx and KuCoin . Not unlike an initial coin offering (ICO), an IEO is another crowdfunding tool for cryptocurrency startups. It relies on an exchange to act as the trusted broker offering the token sale – with each exchange usually issuing its own proprietary token (such as Binance’s BNB) to execute the sale. It usually requires a commitment from the exchange to handle know your customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) checks on a startup’s behalf. While Pirestani said news about a potential Coinbase IEO platform may emerge in the “next few months,” plans for regulated securities offerings in the U.S. are less far along. Announced in July 2018 , Coinbase received regulatory approval to acquire several securities firms with broker-dealer licenses including Keystone Capital Corp., Venovate Marketplace and Digital Wealth LLC. About these plans, Pirestani affirmed that broker-dealer licenses have been obtained by Coinbase, but they’re “still digesting” the acquisition and “repurposing” the respective licenses. Pirestani also noted that security tokens are “talked about a lot but traded much less” and that Coinbase would wait for more market demand to roll out an STO product. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K3iWCmw4ijY Brian Armstrong image via CoinDesk archives",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/11/coinbase-may-soon-launch-an-initial-exchange-offering-platform/,coindesk,2019-09-11,07:16:00,en,307,2097,5.830618892508143,97,0.31596091205211724,san based cryptocurrency exchange coinbase launch initial exchange offering platform ieo coinbase institutional kayvon pirestani speaking panel evolution cryptocurrency capital formation coindesk invest conference pirestani initial exchange offering ieo platform capital formation tool explored coinbase interesting opportunity coinbase pirestani adding nutshell coinbase carefully exploring ieo space stos security token offering make formal announcement ieos supported exchange including bitfinex binance okex kucoin unlike initial coin offering ico ieo crowdfunding tool cryptocurrency startup relies exchange act trusted broker offering token exchange issuing proprietary token binance bnb execute requires commitment exchange handle customer kyc anti laundering aml check startup behalf pirestani news potential coinbase ieo platform emerge month plan regulated security offering announced coinbase received regulatory approval acquire security firm broker dealer license including keystone capital corp venovate marketplace digital wealth llc plan pirestani affirmed broker dealer license obtained coinbase digesting acquisition repurposing respective license pirestani noted security token talked lot traded coinbase wait market demand sto product http www youtube watch iwcmw ijy image coindesk archive,0.022222222222222223,positive,0.3333333333333333,"{'neg': 0.02, 'neu': 0.779, 'pos': 0.201, 'compound': 0.9853}",0.9853,0.02,0.779,0.201,positive,0.0,0.0126582277679859,neutral
binance, News , Binance’s Quarterly BNB Burn to Include Binance Futures Tokens ,"Binance exchange will include all future businesses and products into the scope of each quarterly burn of its native token Binance Coin ( BNB ). Decision made based on community feedback According to a  blog post  on Sept. 12, Binance has decided to include all its products into quarterly BNB burns in accordance with community feedback. The new BNB burning practice will include tokens from Binance Futures, the exchange’s crypto futures platform that was  rolled out  in beta mode on Sept. 2, featuring a 10,000 BNB trading contest. Earlier today, Binance  announced  that Binance Futures will officially go live on Sept. 13. Why tokens are burned? Token burning  is a permanent removal of existing cryptocurrency coins from circulation by the coin’s creators that is commonly practiced for deflationary purposes.  As reported, token burning does not literally destroy them but rather renders them unusable in the future, involving the project’s developers repurchasing or taking available coins out of circulation. Most recent BNB burn The most recent Binance’s token burn took place on July 11, when the major crypto exchange  announced  the completion of the eighth BNB token burn that removed 808,888 BNB tokens ($23.7 million at the time) from Binance’s team allocation.  The exchange noted that the burn was part of the company’s commitment to burn a total of 100 million BNB tokens and that the team’s supply equates to 40% of the total supply. As  reported  by Cointelegraph, BNB slipped 5% on the day the burn was completed. In February 2019, Binance  updated  its white paper’s section devoted to quarterly BNB manipulations, upgrading its former “Repurchasing plan” with “The Burn” section.  The exchange explained that it will be destroying BNB based on the trading volume until it destroys 50% of all the BNB instead of buying back BNB each quarter, using 20% of their profits and then destroying them until the exchange buys 50% of all 100 million BNB back. At press time, Binance Coin is the eighth biggest cryptocurrency by market share of around $204 million. BNB is down 4.7% over the past 24 hours, also seeing a 6.3% loss over the past 7 days at press time, according to data from  Coin360 .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binances-quarterly-bnb-burn-to-include-binance-futures-tokens,cointelegraph,2019-09-12,00:00:00,en,365,2214,5.021917808219178,133,0.3643835616438356,binance exchange include future business product scope burn native token binance coin bnb decision made based community feedback blog binance decided include product bnb accordance community feedback bnb burning practice include token binance future exchange crypto future platform rolled beta mode featuring bnb trading contest earlier today binance announced binance future officially live token burned token burning permanent removal existing cryptocurrency coin circulation coin creator commonly practiced deflationary purpose reported token burning literally destroy render unusable future involving project developer repurchasing taking coin circulation recent bnb burn recent binance token burn crypto exchange announced completion bnb token burn removed bnb token time binance team allocation exchange noted burn part company commitment burn total bnb token team supply equates total supply reported cointelegraph bnb slipped burn completed binance updated paper section devoted bnb manipulation upgrading repurchasing plan burn section exchange explained destroying bnb based trading volume destroys bnb buying bnb profit destroying exchange buy bnb press time binance coin biggest cryptocurrency market share bnb past hour loss past day press time data coin,-0.07433155080213905,negative,0.27205882352941174,"{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.847, 'pos': 0.054, 'compound': -0.8555}",-0.8555,0.098,0.847,0.054,negative,-0.8181817438016598,0.07051282006081526,negative
binance,Markets,Binance to List Its New Dollar-Backed BUSD Stablecoin Next Week,"Binance's new dollar-backed stablecoin, BUSD, created in partnership with the Paxos Trust Company, will be made available for trading on the cryptocurrency exchange the week of Sept. 16. Announced on Thursday at CoinDesk's Invest: Asia conference, Paxos co-founder Rich Teo said: “We minted out first batch of Binance U.S. dollars. It will be made available for trading starting next week [against] a few trading pairs such as BTC and BNB.” Earlier this month, the Paxos Trust Company, which already issues its own dollar-backed and gold-backed stablecoins,  obtained additional regulatory approval  from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) to issue BUSD. Now Binance will list the asset on its exchange, which is the largest globally by trading volume, alongside a slew of other stablecoins already listed on the platform such as USDT, USDC and PAX. “Launching a stablecoin approved by the New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) is a strategic step for Binance to provide on-chain financial services for users across the world,” said Binance CFO Wei Zhou. This is not the first stablecoin to be created by Binance and listed on the cryptocurrency exchange.  In July , the Jersey arm of Binance enabled trading for its own British pound-backed stablecoin called Binance GBP (BGBP). Seeing a multi-coin future where many different ""types and forms"" of stablecoins are traded actively on the exchange, Zhou added: ""[We] hope to launch more compliant stablecoins backed by fiat reserves in the future, introducing more stability to the cryptocurrency world.” Wei Zhou at Invest: Asia 2019, image via Christine Kim for CoinDesk",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2019/09/12/binance-to-list-its-new-dollar-backed-busd-stablecoin-next-week/,coindesk,2019-09-12,09:00:00,en,261,1658,5.344827586206897,93,0.3563218390804598,binance backed stablecoin busd created partnership paxos trust company made trading cryptocurrency exchange announced coindesk invest conference paxos founder teo minted batch binance dollar made trading starting trading pair btc bnb earlier paxos trust company issue backed backed stablecoins obtained additional regulatory approval department financial service nydfs issue busd binance list asset exchange largest globally trading volume alongside slew stablecoins listed platform usdt usdc pax launching stablecoin approved state department financial service nydfs strategic step binance provide chain financial service user world binance cfo stablecoin created binance listed cryptocurrency exchange jersey arm binance enabled trading british pound backed stablecoin called binance gbp bgbp multi coin future type form stablecoins traded actively exchange added launch compliant stablecoins backed fiat reserve future introducing stability cryptocurrency world invest image coindesk,-0.013333333333333332,negative,0.145,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.81, 'pos': 0.19, 'compound': 0.9628}",0.9628,0.0,0.81,0.19,positive,0.99999950000025,0.01724137916171225,positive

binance, Analysis , BUSD — Binance and Paxos Stablecoin Latest to Get US Regulator Consent ,"Over the course of the past few weeks, the global  cryptocurrency  community bore witness to two major announcements related to  stablecoins  — with the first being the launch of Paxos’s gold-backed Ethereum token, PAX Gold (PAXG), and the other being the release of  Binance’s  cryptocoin backed by the United States dollar (BUSD).  
 Paxos , a global digital asset trust firm, announced the launch of its PAXG token via a  press release  a few days back. In the document, the firm claims that its product is the world’s first crypto asset to be fully redeemable in exchange for physical  gold . Not only that, but the stablecoin has also received a regulatory nod of approval from the New York State Department of Financial Services ( NYDFS ), with the government body  referring  to PAXG as the first gold-backed digital currency to become eligible for trading in the state of New York. 
 Additionally, each PAXG token is backed by 1 fine troy ounce of London Good Delivery gold that has been stocked across discreet vaults spread out around London. If that wasn’t enough, token owners are provided with complete control of the gold that is associated with their holdings and have the option of moving their tokens like any other  ERC-20 -based crypto, thereby making it significantly easier for people to trade physical gold without having to bother about the logistics. Elaborating further on the utility of PAXG, Dorothy Chang, Paxos’ vice president of marketing and communications, told Cointelegraph:  
 “PAX Gold stands out because we uniquely have deep experience in both the traditional gold market as well as in asset tokenization. In the traditional gold market, we have a suite of products that have been used by the legacy gold trading markets. For example, our Confirmation Service has been used to confirm over 500k gold trades worth over $1T. Being this ingrained in the gold market has enabled us to draw on our relationships with leaders in the space — like Brink’s and INTL FCStone — to develop the operational infrastructure to make PAX Gold available and redeemable for physical gold.” 
 On the topic of whether the market has seen offerings similar to PAXG in the past, Cointelegraph reached out to Andy Hoffman, the founder of CryptoGoldCentral — a professional cryptocurrency consulting firm that provides altcoin enthusiasts and developers with strategies on how to market existing cryptocurrencies as well as those that have yet to be launched.  
 He pointed out that while an exact analogous product has not been seen in the market before, PAXG essentially resembles a gold exchange-traded fund (ETF) — such as the HSBC-backed GLD ETF — that carries with it a host of tangible  financial risks . 
 Additionally, Hoffman also highlighted that, having previously spent over six years working as the marketing director of Miles Franklin (a major bullion dealer that manages gold, silver and platinum deposits with Brinks and the Dakota Depository), he couldn’t foresee investors flocking to PAXG:  
 “Can’t see why anyone who wanted to exposure to REAL gold would use Paxos, rather than Miles Franklin or even GLD ETF.” 
 So, what makes PAXG unique? 
 As mentioned previously, PAXG is an ERC-20 token that has been built on the  Ethereum  blockchain and is backed by physical gold, meaning it can be traded and moved anywhere around the globe with the touch of a button. Not only that, but the token also allows gold enthusiasts to own a fraction of LBMA-accredited London Good Delivery gold bars.  
 Paxos is regulated by the NYDFS and its associated PAXG token is  one of just three  crypto offerings to have received the regulator’s seal of approval. In this regard, other key facets related to PAXG that are worth highlighting include: 
 
 The tokens are fully-backed by physical gold that is attested by a third-party auditor on a monthly basis. 
 As things stand, PAX Gold is the only gold token available on the market today that can be exchanged in place of LBMA-accredited Good Delivery gold bullion bars. Smaller amounts can also be redeemed via a host of physical retailers located across the globe.  
 Institutional players dealing with PAXG have the option of redeeming their tokens in favor of unallocated Loco London Gold.  
 Using Paxos’ native exchange platform, investors can convert their PAXG holdings into  fiat , physical or unallocated gold. Also, PAXG can be traded across a whole host of popular crypto exchanges that support ERC-20 tokens. 
 From a fee standpoint, Paxos charges its users anywhere between 0.03%–1% (based on volume tiers) for redeeming their PAXG coins. Similarly, the company charges a flat 0.02% as on-chain Ethereum transaction fees and, as with any ERC-20 token, nominal Ethereum gas fees are also applicable on all transactions. 
 PAXG holders have the option of looking up niche details (i.e., serial numbers, brand codes, gross weight, etc.) related to their stored gold reserves — a feature that is quite rare these days. 
 
 Binance and Paxos launch a dollar-backed stablecoin 
 Last week, Binance announced that it was  entering  into a partnership with Paxos in order to launch a USD-backed stablecoin called the BUSD. The digital currency follows in the footsteps of other stablecoins — such as TrueUSD (TUSD), USDCoin (USDC) and Gemini Dollar (GUSD) — and along with PAXG, it is one of the three Paxos created  digital currencies  to have received a regulatory green light from the NYDFS, with the other one being Paxos Standard (PAX). 
 On the subject, Chang told Cointelegraph that by gaining approval from the NYDFS for the BUSD stablecoin, Binance was helping to stabilize the global crypto market. She then went on to say:  
 “Paxos will be the issuer and custodian of all BUSD tokens. With BUSD, there will be monthly audits and every customer acquiring BUSD through Paxos or Binance will go through our KYC/AML compliance process. We believe that with Binance’s network reach and our trusted, regulated service, we will be able to make a huge impact on the crypto markets. This is an exciting step towards bringing more stability to crypto.” 
 From a technical standpoint, BUSD will be made available for purchase at a ratio of one-to-one ratio with the U.S. dollar. Additionally, trades against Bitcoin ( BTC ) can be facilitated via Paxos’s native exchange platform, while those against Binance Coin ( BNB ) and  XRP  can be initiated on Binance.com.

 Lastly, the launch of these crypto offerings suggests that regulatory agencies around the globe might finally be warming up to the idea of digital currencies and the potential they have to offer. On the subject, Hoffman added: 
 “There are many new stablecoins now — and the fact that they are being regulatorily approved, generally speaking, speaks volumes towards the fact that governments are (begrudgingly) starting to accept the fact that crypto is here to stay — both in the U.S. and globally. The Bakkt futures exchange is one such example, as well as last week’s acceptance of the VanEck/SolidX ETF for 144a investors...and I absolutely expect a broad ETF approval for all investors in the near-term.” 
 He also believes that the digital age is finally upon us and that by this time next year, investors should not be surprised to see Bitcoin’s hash rate and price scale up to new all-time highs. 
 What’s the deal with stablecoins? What advantages do they offer? 
 Most crypto enthusiasts are probably well aware of the volatility that the digital asset market witnesses on a near-daily basis. In this regard, stablecoins can essentially be thought of as crypto offerings whose prices are measured in fiat and have their value pegged to real-world assets such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, yuan or even other commodities such as oil, gold, silver and so on.  
 Related:  Digital Yuan: Weapon in US Trade War or Attempt to Manipulate Bitcoin? 
 Also, like many other digital tokens, stablecoins also make use of blockchain technology and are usually decentralized in nature, meaning that they cannot be controlled by a centralized government agency or institution. 
 Talking about the advantages of PAXG, Chang pointed out that by tokenizing gold, it will become easy for investors to acquire the precious yellow metal without having to physically store it. She further elaborated: 
 “By putting gold on the blockchain and tokenizing it, we’re making it easier to trade, divide and leverage gold against other investments. We’re making PAX Gold as easy to own and trade as Bitcoin. We are also democratizing investment in gold as there is no minimum investment in PAX Gold and it can be sent anywhere in the world, 24/7.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/busd-binance-and-paxos-stablecoin-latest-to-get-us-regulator-consent,cointelegraph,2019-09-18,00:00:00,en,1432,8754,5.043296089385475,583,0.40712290502793297,past

binance,Markets,"Binance to Add Fiat-to-Crypto OTC Trading in a Month, Co-Founder Says","Crypto exchange Binance is planning to add over-the-counter (OTC) trading to its platform in a month to provide users with fiat currency gateways. Binance's co-founder and chief marketing officer He Yi said at a media session on Tuesday during the Shanghai Blockchain Week that the exchange will specifically support fiat on-ramp via OTC for Chinese yuan. He added that the new service will be part of Binance's plan in the coming months to dedicate more time and resources to compete in the Chinese market.  Further, the exchange is also rolling out a payment service to allow users from 170 countries to buy crypto assets using fiat currencies at Binance.com. Fiat-to-crypto OTC trading has been a critical part in terms of fiat on-ramp for crypto traders based in China as local authorities prevent the direct connection of exchanges to banks and fiat deposits as part of the ban on initial coin offerings in September 2017. Other long-running Chinese exchanges like Huobi and OKCoin have since then moved overseas and offered crypto-to-crypto trading while recruiting OTC market makers onto their platforms to help users buy and sell cryptos using Chinese yuan.  The news about Binance's OTC capabilities comes as the exchange, which, according to CoinMarketCap data, is the world's largest by trading volume, quickly racks up deals that increase its links with the real economy and improve its connections to mainstream finance. At the beginning of the month, it began to  offer  sandboxes for the testing of two crypto-futures trading platforms, dubbed Futures A and Futures B. Users will vote on which is the best. The following day, it said it  acquired  Seychelles-registered JEX, a crypto derivatives exchange. Last week, Binance  introduced  a dollar-based stable coin, Binance USD, and said the coin received approval from the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). The exchange is pitching its stable coins as alternatives to Libre. Also in the U.S., Binance  said  it would start accepting U.S. customers via its partner from Sept. 18, after banning them earlier in the year. And just yesterday, the exchange  invested  into Mars Finance, a Chinese crypto data and media company, although the amount of the investment was not disclosed.

binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin Price Sinks to 6-Month Low a Day After US Version Launch ,"Prior to Litecoin ( LTC ) kicking off a 200% rally that would spread to Ether ( ETH ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ), Binance Coin ( BNB ) was the shepherd that signaled the altcoin herds to rally forth in what is now affectionately referred to as “altseason.” BNB far outpaced Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Ethereum as it rallied nearly 600% compared to Bitcoin’s 300% rise from $3,100 to $13,800.  The move seemed to be propelled by back-to-back Binance-supported initial exchange offerings, rising altcoin prices and an improvement in general sentiment amongst investors who finally felt the 15-month long bear market had ended.  Daily Crypto Market Performance. Source.  Coin360.com Since notching an all-time high near $40 on June 22, BNB hit a snag and has been in a downtrend since. It seems the real trouble started when Binance announced that United States-based users would be banned from its main platform and forced to the regional Binance America version.  The BNB token perked up a bit once the exchange announced that a U.S. version of Binance would soon launch. But sentiment again soured as the media reported that the number of digital assets and pairings offered paled in comparison to the original platform.  BNB is no longer immune to Bitcoin’s price action and it — along with the vast majority of altcoins — have suffered mightely since Bitcoin topped out at $13,800 and entered a prolonged period of consolidation.  Is BNB a good long? Despite the disconcerting news and disappointing price action, BNB still has a lot going for it. Binance.US  launched  on Sept. 24. As  previously  reported, the platform will list BTC, ETH,  XRP ,  BCH , LTC, BNB and  USDT  across 13 fiat-to-crypto and crypto-to-crypto trading pairs.  On Tuesday, Binance.US also revealed that Cardano ( ADA ), Basic Attention Token ( BAT ), Ethereum Classic ( ETC ), Stellar Lumens  (XLM ) and Ox (ZRX) would be listed and deposits for the altcoins is open now.  Another future positive for BNB is the fact that the native token is used to pay the fees for Binance’s Futures Trading platform. Two weeks ago, Binance  announced  that it would include all current and future BNB-based products and services in upcoming coin burns.  Future coin burns, BNB’s utility for paying trading fees and processing margin trades on the futures platform should make BNB more “useful.” Furthermore, there’s always the possibility that Binance.US will eventually use BNB for trading fees, staking and lending. Given Binance’s ambitious plans for expanding its reach by establishing decentralized exchanges across the globe, it's not too far fetched to imagine that BNB could make its way onto decentralized finance — also known as “DeFi” — platforms like Celcius, Compound Finance, BlockFi and dYdX.  With that said, BNB is not looking great in the short-term and currently continues to lose value within a descending channel. Let's take a look at the charts to see what’s going on.  BNB/USDT Daily Chart. Source:  TradingView BNB fell to $13.80, a new 6-month low not seen since March 21. Today’s abrupt 11% Bitcoin  correction  was strongly felt by BNB and the altcoin dropped below the descending channel.  A strong oversold bounce on the Relative Strength Index (RSI) resulted in a 12.95% bounce from $14.47 to $16.38. But unless the market improves, the next stop for BNB could be at $13.60. A drop below $13.60 could see the altcoin drop to $9.40   BNB/USDT Weekly Chart. Source: TradingView As shown by the volume profile visible range (VPVR) on the weekly chart, a drop below $14 extinguishes purchasing demand until $9 to $11. Though the RSI approaches oversold territory, there is still room to fall and in December 2018 the weekly RSI dropped to 31 before reversing course.  If Bitcoin price enters a lengthy period of consolidation in the $8,000 to $9,000 range, it’s possible that BNB could drop further. The weekly Stoch has also bottomed out resting on 0.   Ultimately, like other altcoins, BNB’s performance appears dependent upon Bitcoin’s recovery and with  Bitcoin market dominance  still at around 70%, altcoin traders might not have much to look forward to other than a strong oversold bounce within the altcoin market.  Admittedly, Ether ( ETH ) seems to be a more lucrative trade at the moment. In the event that BNB does drop below $10, traders might consider opening a long position and scaling in on any dips that might follow.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance, Market Update ," Crypto Markets Report Mild Gains, While Binance Coin Jumps 7% ","Sunday, Oct. 13 — Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to bounce around the $8,400 price mark, while most of the top-20 coins by market capitalization report slight gains. Market visualization. Source:  Coin360 Cryptocurrency markets are seeing mild gains, generally within a tight range of 1–2%. Binance Coin ( BNB ), the number eight coin by market capitalization, is the only top-20 coin that that stands out and is surging more than 7.5%.  Bitcoin has been bouncing between $8,300 and $8,400 for most of the day. The world’s most popular cryptocurrency traded from an intraday low of around $8,330 up to its current trading price near $8,425, showing modest gains of around 1.2% in the past 24 hours.  While BTC trades within a tight range and might be getting ready for a big move, billionaire investor Tim Draper  stated  that he expects Bitcoin to change how governments operate worldwide. Draper called Bitcoin “the startup currency” and says he believes that BTC will bring the world together: “With Bitcoin, and the decentralization that comes with Bitcoin, geographic borders have become less relevant. No longer are we at the mercy of dictators and toll trolls to grow the world economy. [...] In the long-term I believe with regard to business and economics, we are, more than ever, one world.” Bitcoin 24-hour price chart.

binance, Price Analysis ," BNB Gains 23% Plus Other Top-5 Cryptos This Week: LINK, HT, XRP, TRX ","The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has been in the thick of the action over the past week. First, the SEC  rejected  the Bitcoin ETF application from Bitwise Asset Management and NYSE Arca. Next, the governing body obtained a temporary  restraining  order against Telegram and its wholly-owned subsidiary Telegram Open Network ( TON ) for hosting a securities sale which would culminate with the distribution of Gram (GRM) tokens within the U.S. The SEC claims that the ICO was illegal as Telegram did not  register  the offering.  While both news events are overwhelmingly negative, the crypto markets have held their own and have not collapsed. This shows that the markets have matured and the market participants are not dumping their holdings in panic, which is a positive sign. The chairman of the United States Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), however, provided a sigh of relief to crypto investors after its chairman Heath Tarbert said that his  view  is that “Ether is a commodity.” He also suggested that all forked entities should be treated the same as the original asset.  BKCM founder and CEO Brian Kelly believes that the move by the CFTC provided regulatory  clarity  which is likely to attract institutional investors who were sitting on the sidelines. Kelly suggested that these investors are now more confident about adding Ether to their “commodity bucket.”  With Bitcoin holding above its recent lows, some altcoins are also beginning to show strength. Let’s see if we find any bullish setups in the top five performers of the past seven days.  LINK/USD Chainlink ( Link ) has been among the top performers for the past three consecutive weeks. This shows that it is backed by momentum. However, after the stellar rise, can it continue its uptrend or will it succumb to profit booking? The LINK/USD pair recently closed above $2.0531 and this triggered our buy which was suggested in an  earlier  analysis. Our first target of $2.8498 was achieved last week, which shows that the bulls are not expecting a large fall, hence, are buying at higher levels. Though the bulls pushed the price above $2.8498 during the week, they have not been to sustain the breakout. This shows profit booking by the short-term traders at the resistance level. However, with the rise in the past two weeks, the 20-week EMA has started to turn up, which shows that the advantage is with the bulls. If the bulls can propel the price above $3, we expect the up move to reach $4 and above it $4.5826. Conversely, if the bulls fail to scale above $3, the pair might remain range-bound for a few more weeks. Our view will be invalidated on a break below $1.4612.  BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has made a comeback into this list after a long absence. Let’s look at the events of the past seven days that have ignited trader’s interest in it. Recently, the exchange launched the eighth phase of its lending product which allows owners to earn an annualized percentage yield of as high as  10%  for a few cryptocurrencies.  Expanding its services, Binance launched peer-to-peer trading for its Android app users in China. The service will be available for Bitcoin, Ether and Tether ( USDT ) against the Chinese yuan. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that this service will be  expanded  to other regions soon. Zhao also  confirmed  that users are able to use WeChat or Alipay for P2P transactions for payment, but both companies swiftly  denied  that this was true. Has BNB bottomed out or is it ready for an up move? Let’s study its chart. The bears could not capitalize on the sharp breakdown below $18.30 over the past two weeks. This resulted in a pullback that can carry the BNB/USD pair to the resistance line of the channel. As the downsloping 20-week EMA is also located at this level, we anticipate the bears to defend this resistance.  If the price turns down from the resistance line of the channel, it can again dip towards $14.2555. A breakdown of this support will resume the downtrend but if the price rebounds off this level, it will indicate a bottom formation. A breakout and close above the channel will indicate an end of the downtrend. Traders can initiate a long position on a close (UTC time) above the channel and keep a stop loss of $14. The first target will be a move to $33 and above it, a retest of the lifetime highs is possible. HT/USD Huobi Token ( HT ) rallied just above 10% in the past seven days and turned out to be the third best performer. Investors are now wondering whether it bottomed out and is now ready for the next leg of its upside move? The pullback in the HT/USD pair found support just below the 50% retracement level of the rally from the lows of $0.88 to the highs of $5.3506. This is a positive sign and it shows that bulls are stepping in to buy on dips.  On the upside, the bulls might face some resistance at $3.67 and $4.37. If both levels are crossed, a rally to $5.3506 will be on the cards. Traders can wait for the price to rise and close (UTC time) above the 20-week EMA before buying. A stop loss can be kept at $2.90. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from one of the overhead resistance levels and plummets below $2.90. If that happens, a dip to $2.5878 is possible.  XRP/USD Ripple has merged three of its services, xRapid, xVia, and xCurrent, into its RippleNet offering. With this move, “instead of buying xCurrent or xVia, customers will connect to RippleNet — on-premises or through the cloud — and instead of buying xRapid, clients will use On-Demand Liquidity,” said a Ripple spokesperson.  Bank of America (BoA) is also rumored to have  hired  a “treasury product manager” for Ripple. This shows that the bank is warming up to cryptocurrencies in some form. Similarly, United Kingdom-based financial software firm Finastra has  joined  RippleNet, which will help its customers with cheaper and faster cross-border payments. For the past few days, Ripple Labs has been at the receiving end of  criticism  by some community members. However, Ripple CEO, Brad Garlinghouse,  defended  the company and said that its transparency has made it vulnerable to attack. While the  fundamentals are encouraging, has the technical picture also turned positive? Let’s study  XRP ’s chart. The relief rally in the past two weeks reached the first overhead resistance at the 20-week EMA. A breakout of this level will again hit a roadblock close to the 50-week simple moving average (SMA) and above it at the downtrend line of the descending triangle. If the bulls push the price above the triangle, it will invalidate the bearish pattern, which is a bullish sign.  Aggressive traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the 20-week EMA and keep a stop loss of $0.215. Risk-averse traders, however, should wait for the price to breakout and close above the triangle to buy. Both moving averages are flattening out and the RSI is gradually rising to the midpoint. This suggests that the selling pressure has subsided. Our view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from one of the overhead resistance levels and plunges below $0.22.  TRX/USD This week Tron ( TRX ) has teamed up with the Stellar Development Foundation to form a new educational alliance that will  provide  working knowledge about blockchain technology to  university students. Let’s see if we can spot a buy setup on the TRX/USDT pair.  The TRX/USDT pair is facing resistance close to $0.018660. This level has acted as a stiff barrier over the past few weeks. If the bulls fail to scale it once again, the pair might again dip towards the critical support of $0.011240. A breakdown of this support will be a negative sign and could point toward a new downtrend. However, if the bulls can push the price above $0.018660 with strength, the large range of $0.011240-$0.0409111 will come into play. It is possible that the moving averages could act as resistance but we expect them to be crossed. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $0.01860 with a stop loss of $0.0110. The first target target being $0.030 and above it $0.0409111. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance,Markets,BNB-Based Crypto ETP Now Live on Swiss SIX Stock Exchange,"Binance’s native cryptocurrency will serve as the underlying asset to a new exchange traded product (ETP). The world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume said Wednesday it has partnered with fintech firm Amun to develop the USD-denominated ETP. Listed on the Switzerland’s principal stock exchange SIX under the ticker ABNB, the financial product can be purchased through a bank or brokerage like a stock. Amun CEO Hany Rashwan told CoinDesk the ETP will initially be backed by $20 million worth of Binance coins (BNB), representing nearly a quarter of the firm's total crypto assets under management. Since launching the first crypto-backed ETP in Nov. 2018, Rashwan said Amun’s suite of  8 crypto-ETPs  are backed by $75 million in total assets. The regulated ETP provides an avenue for investors to gain exposure to one of the top performing cryptocurrencies. According to Messari, BNB has a $2.84 billion market capitalization, making it the eighth largest crypto by that metric. In recent months, daily transaction volume usually top $100 million. BNB is used to pay transaction fees on the exchange and for Binance's development and projects marketing. The exchange completed its initial coin offering (ICO) of 100 million BNB in 2017, raising approximately $15 million. Binance has capped the supply of BNB at 200 million tokens, of which the firm plans to “burn” half to prevent depreciation.

binance, News , Physically-Backed Binance Coin ETP Launches on Swiss Stock Exchange ,"Cryptocurrency exchange  Binance  has launched a dedicated exchange-traded product (ETP) for Binance Coin ( BNB ) on a  Swiss  Stock Exchange. Binance Coin goes after pro investors In a press release seen by Cointelegraph on Oct. 15, Binance confirmed the BNB ETP would trade on the SIX Exchange from Tuesday. The ETP comes via a partnership with Amun, a local Swiss startup that has already brought various ETPs to market. The investment tool, which features physically-backed contracts, is a first for BNB, which is Binance’s in-house  cryptocurrency  token. In the future, further options could appear for traders. Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao , known as CZ, commented in the press release: “Our partnership with Amun in launching the BNB ETP will provide investors with a new and regulated asset class with a unique dimension to utility tokens, making them more accessible and reliable through a traditional financial infrastructure.” BNB, currently the seventh-largest cryptocurrency by market cap, increased by around 4.5% on the back of the news.  SIX grows its crypto integration As Cointelegraph  reported , SIX began trading the world’s first multi-cryptocurrency ETP in late 2018. Organizers, including Amun, have remained bullish about their appeal to investors, despite the mixed fortunes seen on crypto markets since that time.  Earlier this month, Amun  partnered  with Bitcoin Suisse to launch an ETP based on the two largest cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ).",https://cointelegraph.com/news/physically-backed-binance-coin-etp-launches-on-swiss-stock-exchange,cointelegraph,2019-10-15,00:00:00,en,234,1493,5.333333333333333,75,0.32051282051282054,cryptocurrency exchange binance launched dedicated exchange traded product etp binance coin bnb swiss exchange binance coin pro investor press release cointelegraph binance confirmed bnb etp trade exchange etp partnership amun local swiss startup brought etps market investment tool feature physically backed contract bnb binance cryptocurrency token future option trader binance ceo changpeng cz commented press release partnership amun launching bnb etp provide investor regulated asset class unique dimension utility token making accessible reliable traditional financial infrastructure bnb largest cryptocurrency market cap increased news grows crypto integration cointelegraph reported began trading world multi cryptocurrency etp late organizer including amun remained bullish appeal investor mixed fortune crypto market time earlier amun partnered bitcoin suisse launch etp based largest cryptocurrencies bitcoin btc ether eth,0.07727272727272726,positive,0.43116883116883115,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.919, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': 0.802}",0.802,0.0,0.919,0.081,positive,-0.599999880000024,0.04424778721904613,negative
binance, News , Binance CEO Confused by BNB Price Decline Despite ‘Very Productive’ Q3 ,"Changpeng Zhao, CEO and founder of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance, said that the reasons why Binance Coin ( BNB ) dropped over 50% from its all-time high in June do not make much sense.  “Markets often confuse people” Zhao explained that new services such as margin trading, an increased number of fiat onramps, peer-to-peer (P2P) trading, and  futures trading  have made the last quarter “very productive” with many significant projects coming to fruition.  Resultantly, the CEO isn’t sure why BNB price has slumped over the past few months, mentioning the drop in Bitcoin price among other possible reasons. Zhao noted: “There are many possible reasons for it, although none of them make much sense to me. Yes, there was a drop in the price of bitcoin, our industry’s index. There was some FUD on various things (per usual). Regardless of all that, I think (in my biased view) our results out-shine them all. Yet, the price of BNB did decline. Markets often confuse people, even me sometimes.” Binance burns $37 million in BNB Binance has also carried out a quarterly burn of 2,061,888 BNB, worth roughly $37 million, according to a post  published  on Oct. 17. There are now 185,474,825 BNB remaining. The exchange says it will continue with regular burns until there are 100,000,000 BNB left. Binance Coin burn data | Source:  Binance.com Interestingly, the company’s profits can be calculated from the amount of burned funds, given that Binance burns 20% of its profits.  From this data, it can be derived that Binance earned roughly $185 million in Q3 2019 — its second-best quarter ever. Binance US lists Zcash and Algorand Binance’s U.S. platform  announced  on Oct. 16 it will list more tokens and Bitcoin ( BTC ) trading pairs, all while the work on its mobile trading app continues.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top-5 Cryptos This Week: XMR, XRP, BSV, LEO, BNB ","While the fundamentals in the crypto space have been improving over the past few months, repeated opposition to popular projects like Libra has kept the sentiment subdued. Speaking at the International Monetary Fund and World Bank fall meeting, German Federal Minister of Finance Olaf Scholz vehemently  opposed  the idea of allowing Facebook to create Libra because, according to him, it is the “responsibility of democratic states.” Similarly, the Financial Action Task Force also voiced its  concern  on Libra and other stablecoins when its president Xiangmin Liu said that successful creation of these stablecoins can lead to “new risks regarding money laundering and terrorist financing.”   Cryptocurrency weekly performance. Source:  Coin360 The total  market capitalization  of cryptocurrencies has been stuck between $210 billion and $230 billion since Sept. 25. This consolidation is unlikely to continue for long. Traders should watch the key levels closely to benefit from the impending move. Let’s analyze the charts of the top five performers of the past seven days and see if find any buying opportunities.   XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) has been the best performer of the past seven days. Does its rise from the recent lows indicate that the bulls are using the fall to buy? Is it ready to turn around? Let’s study its chart. The XMR/USD pair continues to slide inside a falling wedge pattern. Though the bulls have held the support line of the wedge for the past three weeks, they have not been able to achieve a strong bounce off it. This shows that the bulls are not showing any urgency to buy even at these levels. A break below the wedge will be a negative sign that can sink the price to the yearly low of $38.83.  On the upside, a pullback from the current levels will face selling at the resistance line of the wedge. Both moving averages are also placed close to the resistance line of the wedge, hence, a breakout of it will signal that buyers are back in the game. Traders can wait for the price to sustain above the moving averages before initiating long positions. The first target on the upside is $97.9733 and above it $121.427. XRP/USD After record sales of $251.51 million worth of  XRP  in Q2 2019, Ripple has drastically  reduced  the sales in Q3 2019 to $66.24 million, which is a drop of 73.66%. The company said that the XRP sale rate is similar to the inflation rate in Bitcoin ( BTC ) and lower than of Ether and Litecoin.  Ripple has  tied up  with Finastra, the third-largest financial services technology firm in the world. This partnership will benefit the existing customers of both companies. Will these positive developments boost XRP prices? Is it ready to start an up move? Let’s analyze the chart. The XRP/USD pair broke above the 20-week EMA but is finding it difficult to sustain above it. However, it has been in the green for the last three weeks, which is a positive sign. The flattening 20-week EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest that the sellers are losing their grip. Above the 20-week EMA, a move to the downtrend line of the descending triangle is possible. This is an important level to watch out for because if the bulls can scale it, the bearish pattern will be invalidated. Failure of a bearish pattern is a bullish sign. Hence, if the pair can sustain above the downtrend line, a new uptrend is likely.  Long-term traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above the downtrend line and keep the stop loss just below the recent low. The target objective is a move to $0.76440 with intermediate resistances at $0.5050 and $0.5650. Our view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below $0.22. However, we give it a low probability of occurring.   BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) continues to be in the news due to  statements  by its backer Craig Wright. However, interest in the altcoin, measured by tweet volume, has dwindled  down  from its peak in  May . Let’s look at its chart and see if we spot any bottoming formation. The BSV/USD pair has been holding above the $80 support for the past three weeks. This is a positive sign as it shows buying closer to this support. On the upside, the relief rally can reach the previous support turned resistance of $107. We anticipate the bears to launch a strong defense at this level. If the price turns down from $107, the bears will again attempt to sink it below $80. If successful, a drop to $66.666 is possible. Conversely, if the bulls push the price above $107 and sustain it, the pair might extend its recovery to $138.950 and above it to $188.690. We will wait for the pair to sustain above $107 before proposing a trade in it. LEO/USD UNUS SED LEO ( LEO ) has risen close to 2% in the past seven days. During the week, it cracked into the list of top 10 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. How does its prospect look on the chart? Can it rise further? Let’s find out. Though the LEO/USD pair made a new low recently, the bears have not been able to capitalize on the breakdown. Buying at lower levels has resulted in a pullback that might face resistance in the $1.0075 to $1.0467 zone.  If the bulls can scale above this zone, the pair can move up to $1.35. Though there is a minor resistance at $1.1217, we expect it to be crossed. Aggressive traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above $1.05 before buying. The stop loss can be kept at $0.94. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and plummets below $0.9410, it can correct to $0.866 and below it to $0.8278.  BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has retained its place among the top five performers for the  second  consecutive week. The week was packed with various positive news flow that kept the price buoyant. Prominent was the  launch  of a BNB Exchange-Traded Product on a Swiss Stock Exchange, in partnership with a local Swiss startup Amun.  Binance  burned  2,061,888 BNB in the latest quarter, worth about $36.7 million. The exchange burns about 20% of the profits it earns. Using this data, the quarterly profit turns out to be about $185 million. The exchange said that Binance Futures — launched on Sept. 13 — was well received by its customers and it reached the number four spot by trading  volume  in BTC futures on Oct. 8.   Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that with institutional participation increasing in the futures platform, the exchange has decided to offer a maximum leverage of up to  125x  on Bitcoin futures. Has the fundamental news flow improved the technical picture? Let’s study its chart. The pullback from the recent lows of $14.2555 has hit a roadblock at the previous support turned resistance of $18.30. We anticipate the bears to defend the zone between $18.30 and the resistance line of the descending channel. However, if the bulls can propel in the BNB/USD pair above the channel, it will be a positive sign and will point to a change in trend. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions as suggested in our  previous  analysis. Contrary to our assumption, if the bulls fail to scale above the resistance zone, the bears will attempt to sink the pair below the critical support of $14.2555. If successful, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance,Markets,"Tencent Says Libra Would Pose Serious Threat to Alipay, WeChat Pay","Tencent, the Chinese internet giant and parent of messaging app WeChat, said the proposed launch of Facebook’s Libra cryptocurrency would pose serious risks to existing digital payment systems. In a blockchain  whitepaper  published in Chinese this week, Tencent said Facebook’s Libra initiative seems “bold and radical” but is actually a “prudent and rational” move for the Silicon Valley giant. The Libra coin could quickly win market share in countries that do not have a credible local currency of their own, or in places where people do not have access to basic financial infrastructure, it continued. But that would be direct competition the Chinese companies could not replicate. “Any internet company that has a relatively mature digital payment system, such as WeChat Pay and Alipay, would be threatened by the stablecoin if it is ever launched,"" the whitepaper reads. China's central bank has been  working  on its own national digital currency for the past few years, while banning any fiat-to-crypto trading activities in the country since 2017. Neither Tencent nor Alibaba, which operates WeChat Pay's competitor Alipay, is involved in any known cryptocurrency or trading projects. With more than  1 billion  active daily users on Tencent’s social media WeChat, its digital payment spinoff WeChat Pay is one of the two leading companies in the industry, along with Alipay, the mobile payment affiliate of Alibaba Group. Both WeChat and Alipay have insisted on a firm stance against crypto exchanges using their payment services as a gateway for Chinese customers' fiat on-ramp in a peer-to-peer fashion through over-the-counter trading. “WeChat Pay does not support crypto trading, and the platform has never been open to any crypto category,” the company's official account said in a  post  on Weibo. “We welcome users to report on any crypto trading on our platform and proactively collaborate with authorities to crack down on such activities,” WeChat added in the post. Alipay also reiterated its ban on crypto trading in a recently  tweet  directed at Binance when the exchange  enabled  over-the-counter trading that would allow Chinese users to exchange crypto assets with a counter-party and settle payments via peer-to-peer transactions on Alipay. Alipay said in the tweet: “If any transactions are identified as being related to bitcoin or other virtual currencies, Alipay immediately  stops  the relevant payment services.” And yet while both Chinese companies share the official stance on crypto assets, they are heavily investing in blockchain and cloud computing technologies. WeChat parent Tencent has been  building  a suite of blockchain services since they released their first white paper in 2017. The company’s new TrustSQL  platform  is designed as a three-part system with the core chain layer, a product and service layer, and an application layer to provide digital asset management and authentication. Tencent led a $20 million Series A round in blockchain provenance startup Everledger, also participated in by asset manager Fidelity Investments, in September. The company also partnered with Intel to  develop  a blockchain for internet of things applications, while starting to  test  blockchain financial applications with the Bank of China in 2017. In 2018, Alipay’s parent Alibaba Group actually  topped  the list with a total of 90 patent applications focused on blockchain-related technologies, even more than other multinational companies including IBM, Mastercard and the Bank of America. “The launch of Libra would significantly affect the course of global expansion for digital payment companies, especially for those who are not in the Libra consortium,” Tencent's whitepaper said. Tencent, with a market cap of nearly $400 billion, has been a communications and internet leader in China since the very beginning. Founded in 1998, the company's name echos the prior decade's favorite technology, the belt clip beeper, or pager. Known across China as "" cent, "" that suffix was added to the last character "" teng "" of the founder's name, Huateng Ma, according to Shenzhen tech lore. Tencent's first product was online software to send messages from computers to pagers.

binance, News , Official: Binance Chain and BNB Will Be Traceable via CipherTrace ,"American blockchain security firm CipherTrace will provide Anti-Money Laundering (AML) controls for Binance Chain and its native asset Binance Coin ( BNB ). CipherTrace to increase AML checks on Binance Chain Binance Chain, a public blockchain of major crypto exchange Binance and the underlying blockchain for Binance DEX, is expected to improve its AML procedures through CipherTrace, Binance  announced  on Nov. 5. Specifically, CipherTrace will be providing Binance Chain with institutional-grade AML controls to increase adoption of the Binance Chain blockchain. Within the initiative, CipherTrace will enable global developers, investors and regulators to access the Binance Chain blockchain for discovering data such as high-risk addresses. Moreover, CipherTrace will be helping those entities to set various controls to protect decentralized applications, exchanges or other crypto-based applications, Binance wrote in its blog post. Customer data will not be shared with third parties, Binance COO says Samuel Lim, chief compliance officer at Binance, claimed that the initiative will not affect Binance users’ security and data protection. Speaking to Cointelegraph, the executive noted that customer information will not be shared with third parties as a result of the new AML practice, adding: “Users can rest assured that Binance will uphold its usual high standards of user security and data protection.” Lim also denied to specify to Cointelegraph whether this move would affect listing of privacy coins such as Monero ( XMR ) in the future, saying that Binance does not comment on specific tokens and maintains the highest integrity in its listing due diligence process. In the announcement, Lim considered the move as a “major win for the community-driven Binance Chain,” noting that Binance users can soon expect more digital token support across its ecosystem. Meanwhile, online critics have outlined the third party disclosure risks associated with AML practices by companies such as CipherTrace and Chainalysis. Twitter account theonevortex  wrote : “Looking forward to chain analysis companies like @ciphertrace and @chainalysis getting hacked. These people sell your data to 3 letter agencies and governments WITHOUT your permission.” CipherTrace recently expanded its platform to support 700 tokens CipherTrace’s support for BNB and Binance Chain follows the recent  expansion  of CipherTrace services to up to 700 cryptocurrencies including Ether ( ETH ), Tether ( USDT ), Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) and Litecoin ( LTC ) on Oct. 15. Claiming that CipherTrace has expanded to support 87% of the transactional volume of the top 100 cryptos, the firm denied to specify which cryptos will not be supported on the platform at the time. On Oct. 21, CipherTrace CEO David Jevans  argued  that crypto regulations by global regulators such as  those  by the Financial Action Task Force’s would trigger a shift of criminal activity from Bitcoin ( BTC ) to privacy coins.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/official-binance-chain-and-bnb-will-be-traceable-via-ciphertrace,cointelegraph,2019-11-05,00:00:00,en,455,2979,5.52967032967033,147,0.3230769230769231,american blockchain security firm ciphertrace provide anti laundering aml control binance chain native asset binance coin bnb ciphertrace increase aml check binance chain binance chain public blockchain crypto exchange binance underlying blockchain binance dex expected improve aml procedure ciphertrace binance announced specifically ciphertrace providing binance chain institutional grade aml control increase adoption binance chain blockchain initiative ciphertrace enable global developer investor regulator access binance chain blockchain discovering data risk address ciphertrace helping entity set control protect decentralized application exchange crypto based application binance wrote blog customer data shared party binance coo chief compliance officer binance claimed initiative affect binance user security data protection speaking cointelegraph executive noted customer information shared party result aml practice adding user rest assured binance uphold usual standard user security data protection denied cointelegraph move affect listing privacy coin monero xmr future binance comment specific token maintains highest integrity listing due diligence process announcement considered move win community driven binance chain noting binance user expect digital token support ecosystem online critic outlined party disclosure risk aml practice company ciphertrace chainalysis twitter account theonevortex wrote forward chain analysis company ciphertrace chainalysis hacked people data letter agency government permission ciphertrace recently expanded platform support token ciphertrace support bnb binance chain recent expansion ciphertrace service cryptocurrencies including ether eth tether usdt bitcoin bch litecoin ltc claiming ciphertrace expanded support transactional volume top cryptos firm denied cryptos supported platform time ciphertrace ceo jevans argued crypto regulation global regulator financial action task force trigger shift criminal activity bitcoin btc privacy coin,0.00625,positive,0.20958333333333332,"{'neg': 0.072, 'neu': 0.662, 'pos': 0.266, 'compound': 0.9958}",0.9958,0.072,0.662,0.266,positive,0.06666666222222252,0.06198347081825012,positive
binance,Markets,Bithumb Global Launches Native Token for Exchange Ecosystem,"Bithumb Global has launched a native coin for Bithumb Chain, the exchange’s custom blockchain. Launched under the “BT” ticker, Bithumb Coin will work as a medium of exchange for the ecosystem, the company told CoinDesk in a statement Tuesday. The Bithumb Chain itself is expected to launch  sometime in the first quarter  of 2020. From a mechanics side, the exchange will mint a hard cap of 300 million Bithumb Coins. Half of the exchange's revenue will be used to burn 50 percent of BT's token supply over time – similar to Binance Chain's Binance Coin (BNB) – resulting in a final 150 million token supply. Initial token distribution will be split between on-exchange incentives and chain development, moreover. Bithumb says the exchange will utilize the coin for handling fees, rights to use Bithumb Chain and future payment mechanisms. Earlier this month, the exchange announced its ""Exchange-as-a-Service"" feature to develop decentralized finance applications or decentralized exchange (DEX) protocols using Bithumb Chain as a backbone.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top-5 Cryptos This Week: NEO, LINK, ADA, BNB, LEO ","The United States Federal Reserve  believes  that stablecoins “could complement existing payment systems and improve consumer welfare” but the operators behind the digital assets will require constant oversight and regulation. The Fed warned that if a stablecoin payment network achieves a global scale quickly, it will increase risks related to financial stability and monetary policy. Interestingly, with all the regulations and monetary policy initiatives of the Fed, the total  debt  of the US has hit $23 trillion. It is not only the US that is burdened by debt. Global debt will reach a staggerring $255 trillion by the end of this year. This massive growth in debt is unsustainable and is certain to result in a major financial crisis in the future. Possibly, the next crisis might usher a change from fiat to cryptocurrencies. Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 The  installation  of Bitcoin ( BTC ) ATMs has continued at a blistering pace. The total number of ATMs worldwide increased to over 6,000, with over three-quarters of the installations in North America. Asia lags behind with only 2% of Bitcoin ATMs, but this shows that there is huge growth potential. With crypto gaining acceptance gradually, is this a good time to buy? Do the top performers of the past seven days show signs of bottoming out? Let’s analyze the charts.   NEO/USD NEO  was the best performer in the past seven days. It rallied close to 12% during the period. The cryptocurrency seems to be benefitting from the consistent  positive  news  flow  out of China. Can the bulls build up on the momentum and carry the prices higher? Let’s analyze the chart. For the past two weeks, the bulls have been struggling to breakout of the overhead resistance at $13.88772. However, the positive thing is that they have not allowed the price to fall below the moving averages. This shows that buyers are in no hurry to book profits and are initiating long positions on minor dips. The NEO/USD pair will pick up momentum above $13.88772. Above this level, a rally to $20.96333 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above $13.88772 and keep a stop loss of $10. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the moving averages, it could dip to $6.65906.   LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has again found a place amongst the top performers. It moved up by about 4% in the past seven days. Does the chart indicate an uptrend that is likely to carry it towards its lifetime highs? Let’s find out. The LINK/USD pair has been gradually moving higher in the past few weeks. The 20-week EMA is sloping up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in positive territory, which suggests that bulls are in command. While the buyers have managed to push the price above the overhead resistance at $2.8498, they have not been able to sustain at higher levels. This shows profit booking by the bulls closer to $3. However, we like the way the price has been making a higher low consistently for the past six weeks. This indicates that the sentiment is bullish. Currently, the bulls are again attempting to scale above the overhead resistance at $2.8498. If successful, a rally to $4.5826 will be on the cards. Conversely, if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $2.8498, a dip to the 20-week EMA is possible. This can be viewed as a buying opportunity. Our bullish view will be invalidated on a break below $1.46.  ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) was the third-best performer of the past seven days with a marginal rise of about 2%. During the week, Weiss Crypto Ratings  tweeted  that Cardano was superior to EOS, which divided the community, with some agreeing and others questioning the credibility of Weiss Ratings. This week Cardano completed the snapshot and balance check for its incentivized testnet on Nov.12. This will allow investors to earn  rewards  by delegating their stake. While there is development on the fundamental side, traders will be observing to see how this impacts the altcoin’s technical setup. Even though the ADA/USD pair has been rising gradually for the past few weeks, it lacks momentum. The up move will face resistance at the 20-week EMA and above it at the 50-week SMA. The 20-week EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears are at an advantage. A breakout of $0.0560221 to $0.0652290 resistance zone will be the first indication that the bulls are back in the game. Above $0.0652290, a move to $0.10 is possible. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, a retest of $0.0357780 is likely. We do not find any reliable buy setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on it. BNB/USD Smartphone maker HTC will launch a limited edition of Exodus 1 that will support various Binance services. This is supposedly the  first  Binance Chain-ready smartphone. Binance will also be the first cryptocurrency exchange to integrate the Fiat Gateway solution announced by regulated blockchain company Paxos. This new service will allow users to  swap  between dollars and stablecoins on a one-to-one basis.  Binance added  support  for buying BTC, Ether ( ETH ) and  XRP  directly with Turkish lira through its local digital wallet partner Papara. Fundamentally the exchange has been making the right moves but does the price action indicate that Binance Coin ( BNB ) bottomed out? The breakout of the descending channel was the first indication that the bears were losing their grip. For the past two weeks, the bulls are facing stiff resistance at the 20-week EMA, which is flattening out.  However, we like that the BNB/USD pair has not given up ground. This increases the possibility of a breakout of the overhead resistance. If the price breaks out and closes (UTC time) above the 20-week EMA, a rally to $32 will be on the cards. Alternatively, if the bulls fail to push the price above the 20-week EMA, the pair might remain  range-bound between $21.2378 and $18.30 for a few weeks. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down and breaks below the support at $18.30. LEO/USD UNUS SED LEO ( LEO ) fell about 1% in the past seven days but still turned out to the fifth-best performer. This shows that the crypto markets are under pressure. Does the outperformance by LEO indicate demand at lower levels? The LEO/USD pair has been consolidating in a tight range of $1.05440 and $0.941 for the past few weeks. This shows a balance between demand and supply at the current levels. While the bulls are buying the dips to $0.941, the bears have been defending the resistance at $1.05440. A breakout of $1.0544 is likely to attract buying as it will indicate accumulation at lower levels by strong hands. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $1.0544 and keep a stop loss of $0.94. The first target is a move to $1.35. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below the support at $0.941, a drop to $0.866 and below it to $0.8278 is possible.

binance,Business,"ShapeShift Launches Exchange Token, FOX, for Commission-Free Trading","ShapeShift is launching its own token, FOX, doubling down on the exchange’s attempts to further decentralized cryptocurrency trading. ShapeShift released the token, akin to Binance’s BNB, on Wednesday, enabling commission-free trading with zero fees between cryptocurrencies. All platform users who sign up get 100 FOX tokens automatically, which, if held, never expire and provide $10 worth of free trading volume per token on a rolling 30-day basis.  “We've obviously been thinking about doing a token ever since 2017 and we wanted to wade into it very slowly and carefully,” said founder and CEO Erik Voorhees in an in-person interview Tuesday. “We've been kind of evolving our concept of what our coin is going to be over the last two and a half years.”  ShapeShift’s FOX joins other exchange tokens such as Binance Coin and  Bithumb Coin  (BN). While still falling under the “utility token” classification, the ERC-20 token has a limited purpose, at least for now.  “This has nothing to do with establishing a new chain,” Voorhees said of FOX. “Basically, we're trying to get people away from custodial exchanges. This is an   endemic problem in the crypto world that was a problem in 2011 when I first got involved and it’s still a problem. So, we realized that to solve that we had to provide all that stuff in one place.” While similar tokens facilitate value transfers between exchange products, FOX furthers ShapeShift’s permissionless ideology by attracting users to a self-custodial exchange with more liquidity than similarly styled platforms, Voorhees said. For now, FOX is basically a digital coupon. In the future, Voorhees said, it could be used for more functions on the exchange. The exchange minted a finite 1 billion FOX tokens, he said. “We're hoping that this will help marginally move some people away from custodians and be more comfortable with the non-custodial model,” Voorhees said about the project’s aim. The token launch follows the  July debut  of ShapeShift’s new platform, which Voorhees said was an answer to the crypto market’s overreliance on custodial exchanges such as Coinbase. As such, Voorhees sees FOX as the third pillar of the company’s strategy to boost financial self-sovereignty “ShapeShift’s goal,” Voorhees wrote in a  blog post  published Wednesday, “is to make self-custody a seamless and enjoyable experience, because this will help the world move toward self-sovereign finance, and away from fiat.” Voorhees says the exchange has more liquidity than any other self-custody option, like decentralized exchanges (DEXs) or swap services. While total trade volume decreased on the platform since the implementation of KYC, liquidity has increased over the same period by 10x on the exchange’s main pair, BTC/ETH, Voorhees said. ""ShapeShift is always the counterparty to each trade,” Voorhees explained. (Typically, order book exchanges match a buyer and seller for each trade.) “This means we provide liquidity in whatever increments we feel comfortable offering,” he said. “We enable up to $50,000 single trades, and a user can trade over and over so long as each trade is under that size.""",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2019/11/20/shapeshift-launches-exchange-token-fox-for-commission-free-trading/,coindesk,2019-11-20,13:00:00,en,500,3142,5.264,198,0.396,shapeshift launching token doubling exchange attempt decentralized cryptocurrency trading shapeshift released token binance bnb enabling commission trading fee cryptocurrencies platform user sign token automatically expire provide trading volume token rolling basis thinking token wanted slowly carefully founder ceo interview kind evolving concept coin half year shapeshift join exchange token binance coin bithumb coin bn falling utility token classification erc token limited purpose establishing chain basically people custodial exchange endemic problem crypto world problem involved problem realized solve provide stuff similar token facilitate transfer exchange product furthers shapeshift permissionless ideology attracting user custodial exchange liquidity similarly styled platform basically digital coupon future function exchange exchange minted finite token hoping marginally move people custodian comfortable custodial model project aim token launch debut shapeshift platform answer crypto market overreliance custodial exchange coinbase see pillar company strategy boost financial sovereignty shapeshift goal wrote blog published make custody seamless enjoyable experience world move sovereign finance fiat exchange liquidity custody option decentralized exchange dexs swap service total trade volume decreased platform implementation kyc liquidity increased period exchange pair btc eth shapeshift counterparty trade explained typically order exchange match buyer seller trade provide liquidity increment feel comfortable offering enable single trade user trade trade size,0.06022408963585435,positive,0.44698879551820725,"{'neg': 0.052, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9477}",0.9477,0.052,0.817,0.131,positive,-0.19999998666666757,0.08108108064280498,negative
binance, News , Binance to Launch Crypto Travel Rewards Card with Startup TravelByBit ,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance  announced  in a blog post on Nov. 28 that it partnered with crypto travel startup TravelByBit to launch a rewards card that facilitates crypto payments on major travel websites. Per the announcement, the card will function like a traditional prepaid card with access to additional discounts and rewards that users will be able to load with Bitcoin ( BTC ), Binance USD ( BUSD ), Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Ontology ( ONT ). The card will be released early next year and will initially target travelers in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, Australia and Europe, with plans to gradually expand. Traveling with crypto The service will reportedly allow its customers to book flights and hotels through major booking sites including Booking.com, Expedia, Agoda, and Ctrip, as well as TravelByBit’s own platform.  TravelByBit is not the first service enabling its users to travel with cryptocurrencies. As Cointelegraph recently  reported , crypto booking firm Travala announced that it will now let its customers reserve any hotel that is bookable through Booking.com with cryptocurrency.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top-5 Cryptos This Week: XTZ, ATOM, XRP, XMR, BNB ","The New York Digital Investment Group LLC (NYDIG) has received  approval  from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to offer its shares to institutional investors, including registered investment advisers, their clients and other eligible investors.  The fund aims to invest in cash-settled BTC futures traded on exchanges that are registered with the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Though the increasing number of offerings by various companies targeting the institutional investor is a positive sign, the larger players have been slow to invest in the space due to regulatory concerns and high volatility.    Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 While the institutions have been cautious, China has been racing  ahead  in developing blockchain technology for “real-world, practical use cases that are far beyond the experimental stage,” according to a report by Forkast Insights, the research arm of Asia-based Forkast. This is a positive sign for the crypto space for the long-term. A  report  by crypto exchange SFOX shows that Bitcoin searches usually peak before the holidays. The firm said that Bitcoin’s price rallied for three consecutive days before Thanksgiving on Nov. 28.  Will the price move higher  before Christmas ? We will have to wait and see. Meanwhile, let’s analyze the charts of the top-five performers to see whether they show any bullish patterns.  XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) was the top performer of the past seven days by a huge margin. The traders cheered the news that Binance would support zero-fee  staking  for Tezos from Dec. 4. The rewards would be calculated daily and distributed monthly. Can the altcoin extend its momentum in the coming week? Let’s analyze its chart. XTZ/USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The XTZ/USD pair has been taking support close to the 20-week EMA for the past three weeks. The 20-week EMA has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, which shows that bulls have the advantage. There is a minor resistance at $1.414152, above which a rally to $1.85 is likely. A breakout of $1.85 will be a huge positive that will signal the start of a new uptrend. Above this level, a rally to $2.87 and then onwards to $3.37 is likely. Contrary to our assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance at $1.85, a few days of range-bound action is likely. The pair will weaken on a break below the critical support at $0.829651. ATOM/USD This is the second week in running that Cosmos ( ATOM ) has been among the top-performing major cryptocurrencies, which shows that it is backed by momentum. Can the altcoin build on its strength in the coming week or is it time to book profits? Let’s analyze the chart. ATOM/USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The bulls are attempting to propel the ATOM/USD pair above the overhead resistance at $4.4389. If successful, the pair will start a new upward move that can reach $7. Therefore, the traders can initiate long positions on a close (UTC time) above $4.4389, as suggested in our  earlier  analysis. Contrary to our assumption, if the bears defend the overhead resistance at $4.4389, the price might dip to the first support at $3. If this level holds, range-bound action between $3 and $4.4389 might ensue. However, if $3 breaks down, a drop to $1.9101 is likely. We expect the bulls to aggressively defend $1.9101. A bounce from this support will keep the price inside the large range between $4.4389 and $1.9101.  XRP/USD Ripple released a total of  1 billion  XRP tokens from its escrow wallet on Dec. 2 but returned it back within seven minutes. Some believe that Ripple dumping XRP has led to a decrease in the token price. However, the company claims that selling is needed to grow its ecosystem and to fund its operations.  In the ongoing court case to determine whether XRP is a security or not, Ripple has  filed  a motion to dismiss the class-action suit arguing that even if XRP were a security, the statute of repose had passed before the lawsuit was brought to court. Following the footsteps of MorningStar Japan, Japanese financial services giant SBI Holdings plans to pay shareholder  dividends  in the form of XRP tokens. Do the fundamental developments offer hope of a turnaround in prices? Let’s analyze its chart. XRP/USD weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The failure of the bears to capitalize on the break below the critical support at $0.22 indicates buying at lower levels. The bounce from the yearly low at $0.20041 has risen back above $0.22, which is a positive sign. If the bulls can propel the XRP/USD pair back above $0.24508, it will indicate that the markets have rejected the lower levels. We would turn positive if the price sustains above $0.24508. However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $0.24508, the bears will again attempt to sink the price back below $0.20041. If successful, a drop to $0.18 is possible. XMR/USD The Monero ( XMR ) network successfully  upgraded  to RandomX on Nov. 30. The new upgrade uses random code execution together with memory-focused techniques and aims to be ASIC-resistant. Can the hard fork boost the price? Let’s study its chart. XMR/USDT weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The XMR/USD pair has reached close to the resistance line of the ascending channel. A breakout of the channel will be a positive sign but it is likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages.  If the price turns down from the moving averages, a drop to $38.83 to $45.4494 support zone is likely. If this support zone holds, the pair might consolidate for a few weeks before making its next directional move. Conversely, if the bulls succeed in propelling the price above the moving averages, a rally to $98 and above it to $121.4270 is likely. Therefore, we retain the buy recommendation given in an  earlier  analysis. BNB/USD In its attempt to expand support to various fiat currencies for crypto trading, Binance listed  four  ruble trading pairs on Dec. 2.  On Dec. 3, the exchange announced the  acquisition  of decentralized app (DApp) information startup DappReview for an undisclosed amount.  “This acquisition marks a significant step into the dapps ecosystem, and we will have more exciting developments in the near future,”  said  Binance CFO Wei Zhou.  Will these steps help in boosting the price of Binance Coin ( BNB )? Let’s see what the technicals are showing. BNB/USDT weekly chart. Source: Tradingview The bulls have successfully defended the support at $14.2555 for the past three weeks. However, the rebound off the support has been weak, which shows a lack of aggressive buying at the current levels. The moving averages are on the verge of a bearish crossover, which is a negative sign. If the bulls fail to propel the price above $16.50 within the next few days, the bears will attempt to sink the price back below $14.2555. A breakdown of the support will be a huge negative and can drag the price to $11.30. Conversely, if the BNB/USD pair rises above the immediate overhead resistance at $16.50, a rally to $21.2378 is possible.   The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance,Markets,Binance Invests Undisclosed Sum in Crypto Derivatives Platform FTX,"Crypto exchange colossus Binance has invested an undisclosed amount of money in derivatives platform FTX as part of a strategic partnership between the two firms. As part of the deal announced Thursday, Binance has purchased equity in the derivatives firm and purchased long positions in the FTX Token, FTT, the platform’s native coin.  “The investment will help accelerate the growth of FTX with support and strategic advisory from Binance while FTX maintains its independent operations,” FTX founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried said. In return, FTX will help develop Binance’s products, particularly its flagship exchange, Binance.com, and over-the-counter (OTC) trading desk. FTX also announced its intention to build out a suite of products complementary to tokenized ecosystems, a project Malta-based Binance will assist. Founded in the spring of 2019, FTX was an incubation project for Alameda Research, a digital asset research firm.

binance,Markets,"Poloniex Drops KYC for Withdrawals Below $10,000 Following US Exit","Poloniex has introduced a new type of account that allows users to withdraw as much as $10,000 a day without completing know-your-customer (""KYC"") verification.  The exchange  said  in a blog post Thursday its new ""Level 1"" accounts will only require users to register with an email address and password. ""Any customers who sign up from here on out can begin trading in seconds with a Level 1 account,"" according to the post. Level 1 users can deposit and trade an unlimited amount of cryptocurrency. They can also withdraw a maximum of $10,000 every day. There are also opportunities to stake proof-of-stake (PoS) coins on the platform.  Poloniex users have reportedly requested the exchange provide a means to trade cryptocurrency ""without giving up on their identity,"" the blog post reads. It continued, ""To our long-time unverified customers, we know how frustrating your experience has been recently and we’re dedicated to improving that for you."" The exchange will update older non-KYC verified accounts to the new level 1 tier, a process expected to take several months to complete.  Payments company Circle  spun out  Poloniex in October, less than two years after it acquired it for $400 million. Weeks later, Tron founder Justin Sun  revealed  he was part of a group of investors that acquired the exchange from Circle, also for a reported $400 million.  Poloniex  moved  from Delaware to Bermuda, when it was a Circle subsidiary. The exchange, which firewalled U.S. residents in November, has said it will now focus on business elsewhere. U.S. residents had until Dec. 15 to withdraw remaining funds from the exchange.  Poloniex first introduced KYC checks in early 2018 to comply with existing identity and verification requirements. In May, the exchange said users who hadn't completed the KYC checks would have their accounts frozen within 14 days.  Back in 2015, founder Tristan D'Agosta  said  the exchange was legally obligated to follow rules set by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Now that it has completely ceased its U.S. operations, those rules may no longer apply. Other non-U.S. based exchanges have similar withdrawal limits. Binance, which  stopped  serving U.S. customers in September, allows users to withdraw as much as 2 BTC – approximately $15,000 – without KYC verification.

binance,Opinion,Stanford Prof Darrell Duffie on Our Big Stablecoin Future,"
 This post is part of CoinDesk's 2019 Year in Review, a collection of 100 op-eds, interviews and takes on the state of blockchain and the world.   Darrell Duffie is a professor of finance at   Stanford University https://www.darrellduffie.com/ . 
 Darrell Duffie is on the faculty of Stanford University's Graduate School of Business, where he teaches and researches financial market design.  Fulfilling the academic adage ""publish or perish,"" Duffie writes a lot. His work spans from modeling financial ecosystems to questioning the credibility of LIBOR (a sometimes-manipulated benchmark for setting interest rates on loans). He also writes about the disruptive inevitabilities of cryptocurrency, specifically fiat-backed stablecoins. In October, at a distinguished  Group of Thirty  event, Duffie gave a presentation alongside Libra co-creator David Marcus and Bank for International Settlements general manager Agustin Carstens on the impact of stablecoins on banking systems. Crypto will transform the economy by reducing inefficiencies at the interpersonal, interbank and international level, he said.  I emailed Professor Duffie a lot of questions about stablecoins over a period of several weeks. Below is a compiled and condensed transcription of our emailed correspondence concerning the very basics of stablecoins, what a central bank digital currency is, and, of course, Libra. What is a stablecoin? A stablecoin is a digital asset whose price is constant or nearly constant in terms of the native fiat currency, that is held and transferred cryptographically. What initially spurred your interest in stablecoins? The weak quality and high cost of current payment systems, especially in the U.S. Group of Thirty International Banking Seminar, Sunday October 20, 2019 at the Interamerican Development Bank in Washington, DC. What do you think were the biggest events in stablecoins this past year? Speaking from the viewpoint of my interest in payment fintech: The biggest events of the past year are the unmasking of  serious problems  in Tether, the initial proposal of Libra, and the decision of the Fed to go ahead with FedNow, which is another approach to meeting the need for an improvement in the payment system. Did you work on Libra, or are you an observer of the project? Yes. I have met with some Libra people on a couple of occasions. I don't work with any firm in the payment space. I am just observing and learning.  What do you think of the regulatory backlash against Libra from EU officials, the US congress, and policy makers in China? The reactions are natural and appropriate:  ""No, you are not going to offer this service until we are confident that it complies with our rules, which are designed to protect users."" Does Libra have the potential to improve payment systems? If Libra complies with the rules, then yes, it could improve payment efficiency and lower payment costs. This would be a positive development. Payments would be faster and cheaper.  But complying will not be easy, and they have already dug themselves into a hole, in terms of perception among regulators. How will this “unmasking” you mentioned earlier affect Tether going forward? New York prosecutors alleged that Tether had a conflict of interest in making a loan from the trust holding assets backing Tether to affiliated parties. So, one might assume that the ""stable coin"" is not in fact stable. This casts doubt on its trustworthiness, with respect to having a stable value. What is Tether's role in the crypto ecosystem? Stability of price promotes use as a medium of exchange. I think Tether is somewhat popular because it is somewhat stable in price, for the time being. What of other crypto-incumbent stablecoins like Circle's USDC or the Binance Token, will they play a larger role outside of their ecosystem?  I expect that Tether has raised the ante for others for demonstrating strong independent controls on the quality of their backing. So far, the incumbent stablecoins have not made a strong case for their technologies. Yes, different stablecoins are in effective competition with each other, given the severe network externalities: Anyone will generally prefer to use the payment medium that others are using. What do you make of crypto-pegged stablecoins like DAI?  I am open minded, but I expect that crypto-pegged stablecoins will have a tough time establishing a critical mass of users for payments applications.  What has crypto's effect been on the banking and finance sectors? So far, the main effect on banking and finance are the heightened awareness of perceived gaps and opportunities in the payment system, and some R&D work, such as JPM Coin. Do you think private stablecoins will disrupt traditional banking services? Actually, I do not expect that private stablecoins will prevail. However, the threat of entry by stablecoins to incumbent payment service providers will cause disruption, including likely improvements in payment services. For instance, it's not clear that JPM Coin will be for general use in broad payments. Second, it would seem unlikely for JPMorgan to be an early disruptor of its legacy franchises in the payments arena. What would JPMorgan's stablecoin likely achieve for inter and intra-bank processes? JPM Coin and  USC  (utility settlement coin) would be useful for settlement of wholesale securities transactions and other large interbank transactions. It's a serious idea, and could in principle work well. I'm not confident that the Fed will co-operate. Some banks could react against it.  Would it be inherently more trustworthy? JPM Coin would be as safe as deposits in JP Morgan Chase, so highly trusted. Given the necessary agreements from central banks, USC would be backed by central banks, so obviously trustworthy.  What do you think of the USD-backed stablecoin proposed by former CFTC executives Gorfine and Giancarlo? It's a serious idea, and could in principle work well. I'm not confident that the Fed will co-operate. Some banks could react against it. An effective CBDC (central bank digital currency) would significantly change the nature of the private-sector payment industry. Credit card interchange fees, for example, would come under pressure.  Further, achieving the network scale effects will not be easy. (Libra automatically overcomes that concern, given Facebook's enormous user base.)   Could you elaborate on the problem of scale effects for introducing a central bank stablecoin? Scale effects apply to any form of money, including central bank stablecoins, in much the same way. A given potential medium of exchange can be an effective form of money only if there is a presumption by most agents in the economy that most other agents are ready and willing to use it as a medium of exchange. This is a network externality: the greater the set of people that use it, the larger is the set of people that want to use it. Pretty simple economics.  A central bank has a huge head start in creating the needed scale effects because it already supplies money that everyone uses. It could simply begin to substitute legacy forms of central bank money (such as paper money) with its own stablecoin. The central bank could also allow banks and potentially other intermediaries to supply its stablecoin to anyone who wants it. Do you think the Fed will implement the idea? I doubt the Fed, or the U.S. more generally, will introduce a state-backed stablecoin. That's difficult technically and politically risky. If it doesn't work well, even just occasionally, government officials will suffer severe criticism.  Where in the world will this technology be deployed first? Among large countries, it looks like China is likely to be the first to deploy a CBDC. Although you write that the Fed will not likely roll out a stablecoin, do you think a central bank digital coin may be developed independent of a blockchain? What qualifies as a ""blockchain"" in CBDCs becomes definitional, and is not necessarily so important to the functional properties of a CBDC. I do expect that the People's Bank of China will offer a CBDC soon, maybe even in the next year.  Could a state-backed digital currency help maintain control over monetary policy? If denominated in the native fiat currency, an effective state backed digital currency would enhance monetary control and in particular improve monetary policy transmission. This is so because it would reduce market segmentation and promote competition in payment and deposit-related services. If a foreign or global stablecoin became widely used in a small open economy, the control of local-currency monetary policy would become more difficult. Are there any particular R&D projects you've been following?  All of the above, and fast payment systems, which are coming along well in other countries. FedNow, if executed well, could be a game changer in the U.S. Token X has amazingly powerful new technology for upgrading the bank-based payment rails -- it's the coolest idea I have seen.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/01/03/stanford-prof-darrell-duffie-on-our-big-stablecoin-future/,coindesk,2020-01-03,16:35:00,en,1443,9016,5.227304227304227,607,0.42065142065142064,part

binance,Policy,India's Central Bank Explains in Court Filing Why It Blocked Banks From Using Cryptos,"The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the nation's central bank, said it ""ringfenced"" financial institutions from dealing with cryptocurrencies over a range of perceived risks. In a response to a petition from the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) – which is currently fighting the central bank in the nation's Supreme Court on behalf of companies affected by the RBI's   April 2018 order  – the RBI said that in restricting bank involvement it had not banned cryptocurrency use generally in India. The Economic Times said in a  report  Tuesday it had seen a copy of the 30-page affidavit filed with the court in September and quoted the RBI as stating: “Firstly, the RBI has not prohibited VCs (virtual currencies) in the country. The RBI has directed the entities regulated by it to not provide services to those persons or entities dealing in or settling VCs. ... The RBI has been able to ringfence the entities regulated by it from being involved in activities that pose reputational and financial risks along with other legal and operational risks.” The use of cryptos in illicit finance was specifically listed as a concern, with the RBI saying that means of anonymous cross-border transactions ""have to be acted upon swiftly and stringently dealt with."" The RBI bank ban has greatly affected the local crypto industry, with several popular exchanges – including  Koinex  and  Zebpay  – having shut down with no way for users to fund their accounts with fiat currency. Others have attempted to cling on by offering just crypto-to-crypto trading. More recently, the world's largest exchange by trading volume, Binance, acquired the India-based WazirX exchange. Previously a fiat-free exchange, Binance will enable users to fund their accounts with rupees on its fiat gateway and charge their WazirX accounts using the tether (USDT) stablecoin. The case against the RBI restrictions is continues before the Supreme Court after months of delays, with the latest hearing to commence Tuesday, according to the Economic Times. The Economic Times added that the RBI, in its affidavit, said it had had discussions with the government in 2018 over whether cryptos should be regulated or banned. It had proposed that initial coin offerings should be barred, it said, while crypto funds should not be permitted. It had also suggested payments for crypto purchases should be barred and monitored under amended foreign exchange laws.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2020/01/21/indias-central-bank-explains-in-court-filing-why-it-blocked-banks-from-using-cryptos/,coindesk,2020-01-21,10:35:00,en,393,2436,5.178117048346056,169,0.4300254452926209,reserve bank rbi central bank ringfenced financial institution dealing cryptocurrencies perceived risk response petition internet mobile association iamai fighting central bank supreme court behalf company affected rbi order rbi restricting bank involvement banned cryptocurrency generally economic time report copy affidavit filed court quoted rbi stating firstly rbi prohibited vcs virtual currency country rbi directed entity regulated provide service person entity dealing settling vcs rbi ringfence entity regulated involved activity pose reputational financial risk legal operational risk cryptos illicit finance specifically listed concern rbi anonymous border transaction acted swiftly stringently dealt rbi bank ban greatly affected local crypto industry popular exchange including koinex zebpay shut user fund account fiat currency attempted cling offering crypto crypto trading recently world largest exchange trading volume binance acquired based wazirx exchange previously fiat exchange binance enable user fund account rupee fiat gateway charge wazirx account tether usdt stablecoin rbi restriction continues supreme court month delay latest hearing commence economic time economic time added rbi affidavit discussion government cryptos regulated banned proposed initial coin offering barred crypto fund permitted suggested payment crypto purchase barred monitored amended foreign exchange,0.1563725490196079,positive,0.27794117647058825,"{'neg': 0.138, 'neu': 0.796, 'pos': 0.066, 'compound': -0.8979}",-0.8979,0.138,0.796,0.066,negative,-0.5714285306122479,0.08383233482735129,negative
binance, News , Research: Ether Was the Cryptocurrency Most Correlated to Other Coins in 2019 ,"Recent research shows that Ether ( ETH ) was the cryptocurrency most correlated to the rest of the crypto market in 2019. In a report  published  on Jan. 22, the research arm of major cryptocurrency exchange Binance suggests that throughout 2019, ETH had an average correlation coefficient of 0.69. The paper, which compared correlation data of 20 top cryptocurrencies, reads: “Ether (ETH) is the highest correlated asset. With an average correlation coefficient of 0.69 throughout 2019, it is consistently among the most correlated assets. The coefficient started at 0.69 in Q1 and rose to 0.72 in Q4 (Q2: 0.65; Q3: 0.74).” Per the report, Ether was much less correlated in the first half of 2019 and became the most correlated in the second half. Interestingly, the paper points out that “programmable blockchains” such as Ethereum,  NEO  and  EOS  often showed higher correlations with each other than with non-programmable assets. USD price correlation in the crypto market Other crypto assets that have shown a high correlation with the rest of the market include Cardano ( ADA ), EOS, Litecoin ( LTC ),  XRP  and Binance Coin ( BNB ). Furthermore, the researchers observed that correlation is typically higher among cryptocurrencies with the highest market caps. Comparison of quarterly average correlation coefficients for the five most correlated assets. Source:  Binance The assets with the lowest correlation to the rest of the market, on the other hand, are Cosmos ( ATOM ), with a correlation of 0.31, followed by Chainlink ( LINK ) and Tezos ( XTZ ) with respective coefficients of 0.32, 0.4. Overall, the median correlation between large cryptocurrencies slightly decreased over the last quarter of 2019 Binance’s effect on the crypto market Another interesting phenomenon pointed out by the researchers is the “Binance Effect,” which refers to the fact that cryptos listed on Binance displayed higher correlations than with the assets not present on the exchange.

binance,Markets,Binance US Now Offers Staking Rewards for These Two Cryptocurrencies,"Binance US has joined other major exchanges in the staking game, adding staking rewards for cryptocurrencies algorand (ALGO) and cosmos (ATOM). Announced Wednesday, the exchange said returns will be given on a monthly basis starting Feb. 1. ALGO and ATOM are the only proof-of-stake (PoS) cryptocurrencies currently available on Binance US, a California-based licensee of one of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchanges. Binance US now joins Kraken and  Coinbase  in offering staking rewards on PoS coins, though the latter two exchanges only offer staking on Tezos (XTZ). Binance US currently offers 28 cryptocurrencies on its platform. With U.S. compliance laws remaining a top concern for the Binance offshoot, the firm says it’s waiting for further regulatory clarity on Tezos.  Binance US CEO Catherine Coley told CoinDesk  the exchange hopes to offer additional staking rewards once more PoS assets are listed. An expected return per coin was not included in the Binance US announcement. Tezos staking returns on both Kraken and Coinbase run  at roughly 6 percent , according to network figures. An alternative to proof-of-work (PoW) mining, staking encourages cryptocurrency holders to participate in the network by depositing their coins in specialized public addresses. Users compound holdings through disbursed network rewards for verifying transactions while bolstering the network’s overall security. Launched in September 2019, Binance US was launched to cater to U.S. citizens following Binance proper’s  booting of U.S. customers  earlier that summer.

binance,Markets,Binance Now Lets Users Borrow Against Crypto Holdings to Fund Futures Trades,"Malta-based Binance, one of the world's top cryptocurrency exchanges by trading volume, now allows users put up their crypto holdings as collateral to fund futures trading. Launched soon before press time, the new ""Cross Collateral"" feature means users can trade futures contracts using assets stored in their Binance exchange wallet as collateral, without the need to use their coins to directly fund orders. Traders using the service can currently borrow tether (USDT) at zero percent interest against holdings of Binance USD (BUSD) – the exchange's own stablecoin  issued in partnership  with New York-regulated firm Paxos – thereby eliminating the need to transfer BUSD to a futures wallet. Aaron Gong, director of Binance Futures, said users of the exchange can expect additional tokens to be supported in the “near future.” “Cross Collateral is a much-anticipated feature for traders on Binance, allowing more flexibility and more choices of deposits to open futures positions,” said Gong. The Binance Futures platform gives users the opportunity to trade 13 pairs with high leverage, and also to hedge existing positions to manage their risk. To date, users can trade BTC contracts with a leverage of up to 125x, the highest among major crypto exchanges.

binance, News ," Continuing Its Crypto Market Takeover, Binance Fires Up BNB Futures ","Crypto exchange unicorn Binance will launch Binance Coin (BNB) futures trading on Feb. 10. As the 17th cryptocurrency available on Binance’s futures trading branch, BNB comes with 50x leverage, paired against Tether’s USDT stablecoin, Binance detailed in a Feb. 7 press release provided to Cointelegraph. BNB pumped with the rest of the market Binance’s BNB coin has already rallied several dollars this month, hitting a price of  $22.16  by press time. Cointelegraph analyst and trader  Keith Wareing  sees upcoming demand for the BNB asset itself. “Looking at trading volumes on Binance, it’s clear they don’t have to sell any of their s***coin for revenue,” Wareing said in a Telegram message, adding: “As such, during the forthcoming bull run, their position as one as one of the most trusted and secure exchanges in the space guarantees to add demand to the BNB token, so I expect it to outperform all other top 10 assets if the Bitcoin bull run continues.” Digital asset trader and social media personality Crypto Dog suggested it was pro-BNB in a Feb. 7  tweet , saying, “Anybody else like BNB?” The crypto-Twitter crowd posted a mixed bag of positive and negative reviews in response. Binance grew quickly Binance got popular quickly after its 2017 launch. By  summer 2018 , the exchange saw more than $1 billion in single day trading volume. Binance shortly after collected  $78 million  of profit in the first quarter of 2019. The business continued its expansion throughout the first half of 2019,  funneling millions  of dollars in volume through its Binance Launchpad for various initial exchange offerings, or IEOs. Several months prior to its futures trading platform launch, however, Binance  banned  U.S. customers. Since the ban, the exchange has opened up a U.S. branch, as well as grown its futures trading platform, hosting Bitcoin futures with 125x leverage, which is substantively faster than others. This new offering comes on the heels of  releasing  Zcash (ZEC) futures trading earlier this week.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/continuing-its-crypto-market-takeover-binance-fires-up-bnb-futures,cointelegraph,2020-02-07,00:00:00,en,327,2022,5.143730886850153,106,0.3241590214067278,crypto exchange unicorn binance launch binance coin bnb future trading cryptocurrency binance future trading bnb leverage paired tether usdt stablecoin binance detailed press release provided cointelegraph bnb pumped rest market binance bnb coin rallied dollar hitting press time cointelegraph analyst trader wareing see upcoming demand bnb asset trading volume binance clear coin revenue wareing telegram message adding forthcoming run position trusted secure exchange space guarantee add demand bnb token expect outperform top asset bitcoin run continues digital asset trader social medium personality crypto dog suggested pro bnb tweet bnb crypto twitter crowd posted mixed bag positive negative review response binance grew quickly binance popular quickly launch exchange single trading volume binance shortly collected profit business continued expansion half funneling million dollar volume binance launchpad initial exchange offering ieos month future trading platform launch binance banned customer ban exchange opened grown future trading platform hosting bitcoin future leverage substantively faster offering heel releasing zcash zec future trading earlier,0.10387728213815171,positive,0.31853943158290987,"{'neg': 0.079, 'neu': 0.765, 'pos': 0.157, 'compound': 0.9231}",0.9231,0.079,0.765,0.157,positive,0.0,0.0680272104215836,neutral
binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptos This Week (Feb 9): XTZ, BNB, BSV, ETH, LINK ","Bitcoin has extended its strong run this year by a move above the psychologically critical  level of $10,000 . The positive sentiment in Bitcoin is leading the crypto space higher. In 2020, most major altcoins have been outperforming Bitcoin, which shows investor interest has picked up in them once again. However, the focus of the crypto industry remains on the forthcoming Bitcoin halving. Coinbase believes that the supply rate reduction will further cement Bitcoin’s position as  digital gold  and it will act as a rival to gold in the digital age.  American provider of investment data Weiss Ratings has also  upgraded  its rating for Bitcoin to A- due to “improving fundamentals and positive price action ahead of Bitcoin's next halving.”    Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 Morgan Creek Digital co-founder & partner Anthony Pompliano believes that Bitcoin has started its  journey  towards his target objective of $100,000 by the end of the Dec. 2021. BitMEX Co-Founder & CEO Arthur Hayes is also bullish but he wants a measured move up. He tweeted: “Slow and steady wins the race. Let’s take the staircase up to #bitcoin $20k.”  With bullish voices all around, do the technicals of the top performers also point to a further rally? Let’s analyze the charts to find out. XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) is the top performer of this week with a rally of above 40%. The altcoin has been an  outperformer  in 2020 as it has rallied about 77% year-to-date. Can it build on its momentum? Let’s study its chart.  XTZ USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The XTZ/USD pair recently completed the breakout of an ascending triangle pattern. This setup has a minimum target objective of $3.35. However, we anticipate the up move to face resistance at $2.50 and above it $2.90.  Due to the sharp rally of the past two weeks, the RSI has entered into the overbought zone, which points to a possible consolidation or a minor correction in the next few days.  Usually, after the breakout of a pattern, it is seen that the price retests the breakout levels. In this case, a retest of $1.85 is possible. If this retest holds and the price bounces off it, a low-risk buying opportunity opens up. Our positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below $1.85.  BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has made an entry into the top performers’ list after a long time. Several fundamental events this week received a thumbs up from the traders. Binance launched  futures   trading  for Zcash ( ZEC ) and BNB this week.  The exchange  added  support for the Russian ruble, which allows the users to make the purchases using their Visa banking card. Binance  hired  Iskander Malikov, former chief operating officer at TradingView, as the new director of fiat to boost its fiat-to-crypto gateways.  The market participants also seem excited about a new product called Binance Cloud that is expected to be  unveiled  in the next few days. Can these developments boost prices? Let’s study the chart. BNB USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The sharp up move of this week scaled above the overhead resistance at $18.50 and $21.80. This shows that the BNB/USD pair has picked up momentum. The price has reached $23.5213, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. If the price turns down from the current levels but does not give up much ground, it will increase the possibility of a breakout above $23.5213. A breakout above this level is likely to start a new uptrend. The first level to watch on the upside is $32 and above it a retest of the lifetime highs is possible.   However, if the price reverses direction from the current levels and sinks below $20, the pair might extend its stay inside the $18.50 to $23.5213 range for a few more days. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) completed a scheduled  upgrade  named Genesis, which has removed the default hard cap for block sizes. Now, it is up to the miners to manage the consensus of block size and transaction capacity on the network.  Similar to the positive rumblings about the forthcoming Bitcoin halving, BSV’s price is also showing a positive movement before its  upcoming  halving in April.  BSV USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview After two weeks of consolidation, the bulls are attempting to resume the uptrend. This shows that the dip from $458.74 to $244.34 did not scare away investors. The buyers purchased the retest of the breakout level of $255.62, which was its previous high. Though the price broke above the overhead resistance at $337.80 this week, the bulls are struggling to sustain the higher levels. This shows that some investors who are stuck at higher levels are offloading their positions.  If the price stays below $337.80, the BSV/USD pair might remain range-bound for a few more weeks. However, if the bulls can sustain the price above $337.80, a rally to the lifetime highs at $458.74 is possible. The RSI remains in the overbought zone, which warrants caution. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) rallied about 17% in the past seven days and turned out as the fourth-best performer. In an Ask Me Anything session, Danny Ryan from Ethereum Foundation said that he  expects  Ethereum 2.0 — Phase 0 to “launch by July 30, 2020 (the 5th anniversary of Ethereum 1.0).”  Can the price action remain bullish leading up to the transition from proof of work to proof of stake? Let’s study the charts to find out.   ETH USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The up move in the ETH/USD pair picked up momentum this week and broke above the resistance at $197.75. We anticipate the bears to mount a strong defense at $235.70. If the price turns down from this level, it might remain range-bound between $235.70 and $197.75 for a few days. However, if the bulls succeed in breaking and sustaining the price above $235.70, the pair is likely to rally to the $318.238 to $366 resistance zone as there is no significant roadblock in between.  On the downside, the bulls will hold the advantage as long as the price remains above $197.75. A break below this level will turn the trend in favor of the bears. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) rounded up the top 5 performers with a move of about 15% in the past seven days. Does its chart project a further move higher? Let’s see.  LINK USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The LINK/USD pair has broken out of the large range it had been stuck in for the past few months. This shows that the bulls have overpowered the bears and they continue to buy at higher levels.  The target objective of the breakout of the range is $4.5, which is just below the lifetime high at $4.5826. We anticipate the bears to defend the lifetime highs aggressively. Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to sustain the price above $3 and the price dips back below it. In such a case, the pair might extend its consolidation for a few more weeks.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance,Markets,Binance to Announce White-Label Exchange Infrastructure for Local Markets,"Binance will soon be launching a digital asset trading platform that can be rebranded by smaller exchanges for their local markets. Binance Cloud will offer local exchanges spot market and futures trading, as well as local bank API integrations and peer-to-peer (P2P) fiat-to-cryptocurrency exchange services, the company will say in a statement this week. Implementing a product like Binance Cloud would relieve potential exchange operators of the software burdens involved in security and scalability. That gives them more time to worry about, say, getting the proper licenses and registrations in their jurisdiction.  Binance Cloud will offer the matching engine, security controls and liquidity of the main Binance.com exchange. So while an exchange may have its own branding and local fiat currency, the back end will basically be Binance itself, which will bring the benefit of more liquidity, albeit indirectly, and potentially in places where Binance doesn’t currently operate.    “The Binance Cloud service is an all-in-one solution, featuring an easy-to-use dashboard that allows customers to manage funds, trading pairs and coin listings, as well as multilingual support, depth-sharing with the Binance.com global exchange, and more opportunities to collaborate with the ecosystem,"" the company said.  Soon, Binance also plans adding “staking and OTC (over-the-counter) trading services, as well as token launch capabilities via an IEO (initial exchange offering) platform. This could mean Binance would have to compete with  AlphaPoint , one of the largest infrastructure providers on the cryptocurrency exchange market today. Founded in 2013, AlphaPoint provides software services to some of the largest exchanges in the world, although it doesn't discuss specific clients.  Exchanges are not easy to build. There are many elements to consider such as order types and matching as well as other features. Security and scaling during massive bull runs are also huge concerns for exchanges.  Security has been an issue for Binance itself. It was breached in 2019 with $40.7 million stolen  after hackers accessed exchange users’ API keys and 2FA codes . While an explanation on further technical details was never published on the hack, the exchange covered the losses via its “Secure Asset Fund for Users” (SAFU) insurance fund. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/02/17/binance-to-announce-white-label-exchange-infrastructure-for-local-markets/,coindesk,2020-02-17,13:00:00,en,354,2340,5.584745762711864,129,0.3644067796610169,binance launching digital asset trading platform rebranded smaller exchange local market binance offer local exchange spot market future trading local bank api integration peer peer fiat cryptocurrency exchange service company statement implementing product binance relieve potential exchange operator software burden involved security scalability time worry proper license registration jurisdiction binance offer matching engine security control liquidity binance exchange exchange branding local fiat currency end basically binance bring benefit liquidity albeit indirectly potentially place binance operate binance service solution featuring easy dashboard customer manage fund trading pair coin listing multilingual support depth sharing binance global exchange opportunity collaborate ecosystem company binance plan adding staking otc counter trading service token launch capability ieo initial exchange offering platform binance compete alphapoint largest infrastructure provider cryptocurrency exchange market today founded alphapoint software service largest exchange world discus specific client exchange easy build element order type matching feature security scaling massive run huge concern exchange security issue binance breached stolen hacker accessed exchange user api fa code explanation technical detail published exchange covered loss secure asset fund user safu insurance fund,0.08771929824561404,positive,0.37456140350877193,"{'neg': 0.054, 'neu': 0.748, 'pos': 0.198, 'compound': 0.9774}",0.9774,0.054,0.748,0.198,positive,-0.07692307100591762,0.07738095192035148,negative
binance,Tech,Steem Community Mobilizes Popular Vote in Battle With Justin Sun,"The Steem community is striking back after an attempted end-around by Tron founder  Justin Sun . While CoinDesk has been writing this report, four former Steem blockchain validators (known as ""witnesses”) have been voted back onto the council of 20 nodes that keeps Steem running.  Steem validators tell CoinDesk that by hitting four validators it is no longer possible for the Tron Foundation to launch a contentious hard fork to change the economic rules governing STEEM tokens. On Monday , Sun was able to put a new slate of witnesses in charge after a contentious soft fork limited his voting power. Sun  acquired the popular Steemit app and its large share of STEEM tokens on  Feb. 14 .  Referring to the tokens that were effectively frozen in a community-led  soft fork  following the Steemit acquisition, he wrote  on Twitter  Tuesday: ""#STEEM has successfully defeated the hackers & all funds are super #SAFU.""  There's no better way to put this: One man’s ""hack"" is another’s ""legitimate exercise of power by a blockchain's duly elected leaders.""  Sun's tweet got  ratio’d  pretty hard, with 486 replies to 236 retweets, as of this writing. Here is what we know. (It's important to note that unlike some blockchains, Steem uses a delegated proof-of-stake [DPoS] consensus mechanism, meaning a limited number of nodes validate transactions on the chain.) To recap: Early Monday morning the Steem  blockchain was taken over  by a group of recently created accounts with names like ""goodguy24,"" ""nicetry001"" and ""bostonawesome."" These witnesses emerged after the previous set of 20 leaders presided over the aforementioned freezing of Sun’s newly acquired “Steemit Inc ninja-mined stake” of STEEM tokens. At issue: Whether that pool of tokens – large enough to sway the governance of the entire Steem blockchain – could be used at Sun’s discretion. Steem has always had angst over Steemit’s cache of STEEM, but former witnesses tell CoinDesk that Steemit had always committed not to vote those coins. The soft fork was executed because witnesses feared that would no longer be the case with Sun. The exact volume of Steemit's ninja-mined stake has always been unclear; however, Sun referred to it as 65 million STEEM in  one of his Tuesday tweets . In a thread of 10 tweets, Sun defended his company's actions. He described the  soft fork  by writing: ""Such actions are against every aspect of the core value of humanity & decentralization & sanctity of private property."" He described the  influx of a new slate of witnesses  by writing: ""Misleading comments re us collaborating w/ exchanges on a hostile takeover is false. Our intention was never to take over the network & all parties' votes will be withdrawn.""  Just before CoinDesk's report on Monday came out, Binance CEO “CZ” Changpeng Zhao indicated his company was  likely to unstake  its Steem from the deciding vote.  Overnight,  Huobi issued a statement , also committing to canceling the vote. ""Based on the information provided to us and out of an abundance of caution, we decided that helping Steemit and Tron was in the best interest of our users – and the network at large,"" Huobi wrote. “However, this action is not final.” Meanwhile, on a  Discord server  managed by one of the newly re-annointed Steem witnesses, token holders have been organizing. A member of the community who goes by @Aggroed and runs the server told CoinDesk via email: ""That's a community gathering place where we host town hall discussions that anyone in the Steem community is welcome to attend. We hosted seven hours of open forum yesterday. We're currently in hour 3 today."" He said longtime witnesses have been stumping in various private and public forums. It’s activating  a new level  of voter participation on the chain.  Steemit and Tron have yet to reply to requests for comment from CoinDesk.  Steemit resignations Steemit has become a small company – and it's rapidly getting smaller. In the last 24 hours, four employees have quit:  Andrew Levine , head of communications;  Steve Gerbino , a developer;  Tim @roadscape , a developer who works pseudonymously; and developer  Michael Vandeberg . Similarly, when the Tron Foundation acquired BitTorrent, that company also saw  a rash  of employee exits and a subsequent  lawsuit . Steemit initiated a restructuring in November 2018, after  announcing on YouTube  it would lay off 70 percent of its employees. Last year Steemit published  an update  on the restructuring, listing six staff members who represented its leadership. The list included Levine and Vandeberg.  It's not clear how many people worked at Steemit at the time of Sun’s acquisition, but one source with knowledge of the community indicated it only had seven employees.  Watch the votes As the backing for Tron's witnesses recedes, the backing for the old witnesses is growing.  The first two witnesses who returned to top slots today were part of the group that enacted the soft fork. As of this writing, @Yabapmat has over 10,000 voters (or, more accurately, wallets) supporting his role and @roelandp has more than 12,000 voters. Meanwhile, the top witness from the group voted in by Tron, Binance and Huobi is only backed by 51 voters.  Additionally, the gap in votes between the new witnesses supported by the Tron Foundation and those supported by the community has shrunk dramatically. The Tron-backed witnesses are losing votes (likely from exchanges unstaking STEEM as they announced they would) and the old slate of witnesses is gaining. It's gone from a big difference to a tiny one.   The broader crypto community has generally been supportive of the Steem community. For example, 1confirmation's Nick Tomaino  tweeted , ""The Steem situation also shows you can’t buy a community, you have to earn it.""  Still, some remain skeptical of its underlying structure. Dovey Wan of Primitive Ventures  tweeted , ""The hostile take over of $STEEM only tells you how hypocritical SUN is and why DPOS as a consensus layer is non-resilient.""  But STEEM holders haven't given up on their blockchain. Matt Rosen, a co-founder of the Steem-based game Splinterlands, runs a witness (with @Aggroed) that served for a long time in the top 20. That witness was the first to break through to the top 20 again following yesterday's events. He told CoinDesk in an email: ""The Steem community has rallied against the takeover in an unbelievable and unprecedented manner with well over 20M STEEM worth of votes being added to the community-chosen witnesses in order to try to overtake the Tron/Exchange voted accounts.""",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/03/03/steem-community-mobilizes-popular-vote-in-battle-with-justin-sun/,coindesk,2020-03-03,21:40:00,en,1077,6584,5.065923862581244,412,0.38254410399257194,steem community striking attempted end tron founder coindesk writing report steem blockchain validators witness voted node steem running steem validators coindesk hitting validators longer tron foundation launch contentious hard fork change economic rule governing steem token put witness charge contentious soft fork limited voting acquired popular steemit app share steem token referring token effectively frozen community led soft fork steemit acquisition wrote twitter steem successfully defeated hacker fund super safu put legitimate exercise blockchain duly elected leader tweet ratio pretty hard reply retweets writing important note unlike blockchains steem delegated proof stake dpos consensus mechanism meaning limited number node validate transaction chain recap morning steem blockchain group recently created account name goodguy nicetry bostonawesome witness emerged previous set leader presided aforementioned freezing newly acquired steemit ninja mined stake steem token issue token sway governance entire steem blockchain discretion steem angst steemit cache steem witness coindesk steemit committed vote coin soft fork executed witness feared longer exact volume steemit ninja mined stake unclear referred steem tweet thread tweet defended company action soft fork writing action aspect humanity decentralization sanctity private property influx witness writing misleading comment collaborating exchange hostile takeover false intention network party vote withdrawn coindesk report binance ceo cz changpeng company unstake steem deciding vote overnight huobi issued statement committing canceling vote based information provided abundance caution decided helping steemit tron interest user network huobi wrote action final discord server managed newly annointed steem witness token holder organizing member community aggroed run server told coindesk email community gathering host town discussion steem community attend hosted hour open forum yesterday hour today longtime witness stumping private public forum activating level voter participation chain steemit tron reply request comment coindesk steemit resignation steemit company rapidly smaller hour employee quit communication gerbino developer roadscape developer work pseudonymously developer vandeberg similarly tron foundation acquired bittorrent company employee exit subsequent lawsuit steemit initiated restructuring announcing youtube percent employee steemit published update restructuring listing staff member represented leadership list included vandeberg clear people worked steemit time acquisition source knowledge community employee watch vote backing tron witness recedes backing witness growing witness returned top slot today part group enacted soft fork writing yabapmat voter accurately wallet supporting role roelandp voter top witness group voted tron binance huobi backed voter additionally gap vote witness supported tron foundation supported community shrunk dramatically tron backed witness losing vote exchange unstaking steem announced witness gaining big difference broader crypto community generally supportive steem community confirmation tomaino tweeted steem situation show buy community earn remain skeptical underlying structure dovey primitive venture tweeted hostile steem tell hypocritical dpos consensus layer resilient steem holder blockchain founder steem based game splinterlands run witness aggroed served time top witness break top yesterday event told coindesk email steem community rallied takeover unbelievable unprecedented manner steem vote added community chosen witness order overtake tron exchange voted account,0.12986129516741762,positive,0.4728531672409223,"{'neg': 0.082, 'neu': 0.792, 'pos': 0.127, 'compound': 0.9517}",0.9517,0.082,0.792,0.127,positive,-0.4615384437869829,0.05803571415617028,negative
binance,Features,Lesser-Known Exchange Inflates Paxos Standard Daily Trading Volume to Record Highs,"While it seems Paxos Standard (PAX)  experienced a sudden surge in trading volumes, the stablecoin’s own issuer questions that very data.  Data appear to show Paxos Trust Company, the New York-based regulated blockchain company, saw daily trading volume on its stablecoin rise to a record high of $1.3 billion on Tuesday – representing a staggering 282 percent rise from the trading volume of $339 million observed on March 1, according to crypto derivatives research firm Skew.  PAX volume However, the spike in trading volume may not be what it seems, as over $850 million is coming from a lesser-known centralized cryptocurrency exchange based in the British Virgin Islands called TOKOK,  according to  data source CoinMarketCap.  Often, random exchanges inflate the volume figures, making the record tally look unreliable. CoinDesk reached out to TOKOK for comment but the exchange did not respond by press time. PAX transactions on Mar. 3, 2020, according to CoinMarketCap. If the volume data from TOKOK are excluded, the tally would be about $400 million,  the average daily volume witnessed in the last six months.  A Paxos spokesperson told CoinDesk faulty data on aggregator sites may be the culprit, adding the combined daily trading volume of three stablecoins powered by Paxos - PAX, Huobi stablecoin (HUSD) and Binance stablecoin (BUSD) - is $60 million, according to Messari’s real 24-hour volume.  The key takeaway here is the headline trading volume figure can be misleading, and investors should always check whether volume is coming through from reliable exchanges before drawing conclusions.  Transaction count surges PAX recently registered an all-time high daily transaction count of 6,800 and processed about 6,500 transactions on March 2, according to Coin Metrics Pro.  PAX Supply And Transactions The daily transaction count is currently up nearly 600 percent from lows below 1,000 seen in December.  Meanwhile, the stablecoin’s supply has dropped below $200 million for the first time since September, having topped out near $260 million in January.  Paxos Trust Company launched stablecoin PAX in September 2018 and is responsible for backing every issued token with U.S. dollars held in segregated accounts at FDIC-insured U.S. banks. With market capitalization of $190 million, PAX is currently the fourth-largest stablecoin, according to data source CoinMarketCap.   Generally speaking, a stablecoin is a cryptocurrency designed to minimize price volatility.  That is achieved by pegging the value of the coin to other asset classes, usually U.S. dollars.  Paxos  launched  a Fiat Gateway service in November last year to allow customers to more easily fund their accounts with traditional money. Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, was the first to integrate Paxos’ new dollar gateway.  Meanwhile, in January, the company  announced  auto-transfers between traditional accounts and stablecoins.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/03/03/lesser-known-exchange-inflates-paxos-standard-daily-trading-volume-to-record-highs/,coindesk,2020-03-03,20:04:00,en,449,2961,5.547884187082405,141,0.31403118040089084,paxos standard pax experienced sudden surge trading volume stablecoin issuer question data data show paxos trust company based regulated blockchain company trading volume stablecoin rise record representing staggering percent rise trading volume observed crypto derivative research firm skew pax volume spike trading volume coming lesser centralized cryptocurrency exchange based british virgin island called tokok data source coinmarketcap random exchange inflate volume figure making record tally unreliable coindesk reached tokok comment exchange respond press time pax transaction coinmarketcap volume data tokok excluded tally average volume witnessed month paxos spokesperson told coindesk faulty data aggregator culprit adding combined trading volume stablecoins powered paxos pax huobi stablecoin husd binance stablecoin busd messari hour volume takeaway headline trading volume figure misleading investor check volume coming reliable exchange drawing conclusion transaction count surge pax recently registered time transaction count processed transaction coin metric pro pax supply transaction transaction count percent low stablecoin supply dropped time topped paxos trust company launched stablecoin pax responsible backing issued token dollar segregated account fdic insured market capitalization pax largest stablecoin data source coinmarketcap generally speaking stablecoin cryptocurrency designed minimize volatility achieved pegging coin asset class dollar paxos launched fiat gateway service customer easily fund account traditional binance world largest cryptocurrency exchange trading volume integrate paxos gateway company announced auto transfer traditional account stablecoins,0.04222222222222224,positive,0.4755555555555555,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.875, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.7783}",0.7783,0.041,0.875,0.084,positive,-0.3333333055555579,0.06060606029996939,negative
binance, News , Stablecoins Gain Market Share Amid Crypto Bloodbath ,"While most cryptocurrencies have seen their market capitalization slashed over the past month, the market meltdown has seen stablecoins ascend the market cap rankings.  As of press time, six stablecoins currently reside among the top 50 crypto assets by capitalization. USDT ranks fourth  The largest-stablecoin by capitalization, Tether ( USDT ), currently ranks as the fourth-largest cryptocurrency with a market cap of $4.66 billion. Despite the total USDT market cap growing by just 0.5% in four weeks, Tether has crept up the ladder since ranking seventh by capitalization on Feb. 15.  However, due to the plummeting prices of the assets that USDT is traded against, Tether volume has fallen 20% from $48 billion to $60 billion over the same period. USDC ranks 17th, up from 30th Circle’s USD Coin ( USDC ) has made significant strides over the past month, climbing from the 30th-ranked virtual currency with a capitalization of $430 million to place 17th with a market cap of $601.5 million today.  Jeremy Allaire, the co-founder and CEO of Circle, took to Twitter on March 14 to celebrate USDC’s now 40% gain in capitalization over the past month,  stating : “USDC surging in market demand over the past days, reaching new ATH at $568m in circulation. Fascinating to see ‘flight to safety’ within the crypto macro market, but also demand for high quality USD liquidity for markets. While not as exciting to see markets so crushed, it's still rewarding to see that this entirely new, entirely digital, blockchain based monetary infrastructure is working.” As with Tether, 24-hour USDC volume has fallen roughly 20% from $936.5 million four weeks ago to $757 million today. PAXOS ranks 27th up from 42nd The third-largest stablecoin, Paxos Standard ( PAX ), has seen a nearly 5% gain in market cap over four weeks from $208 million to $218 million, bolstered by a recent injection of 7.6 million tokens coins from the PAX Treasury.  Despite the relatively small increase in capitalization, PAX has ascended from 42nd to currently comprise the 27th-largest crypto asset.  PAX is one of the few stablecoins to have seen an increase in trade activity since February, with 24-hour volume gaining 80% from $382 million to $684 million. Other stablecoins make notable gains  The past month has seen TrueUSD ( TUSD ) clamber into the top 50 cryptocurrencies by capitalization — ascending from 60th to currently rank as the 35th-largest crypto asset. Binance USD ( BUSD ), which launched just six months ago, has seen an enormous gain in market share this past month. From Feb. 16 to March 15, BUSD jumped from ranking 243rd to 36th alongside a more than 600% increase in capitalization from $17.5 million to $124 million today. BUSD volume has also increased by 50% from $78 million to $118 million.

binance,Markets,Chinese Financial Watchdog Warns of Manipulative Crypto Exchanges,"The National Internet Finance Association of China (NIFA), a major Chinese financial watchdog, warned investors of rising risks in crypto investments. While manipulation is a longstanding concern for crypto investors, NIFA's warning is notable for also pushing back on the narrative of digital currency as a safe haven during a time of  global turmoil . NIFA, a self-regulatory organization affiliated with China’s central bank,  said Thursday  that foreign-based crypto exchanges have faked trading volume, according to its own data analysis. It also noted some trading platforms compared digital currencies to safe haven assets like gold and silver, but a recent  tumble in the crypto market  caused significant losses for investors.   “In our sampling analysis based on trading data from some of the exchanges, the daily trading turnover rate for more than 40 coins is over 100 percent, while more than 70 coins’ rate exceeds 50 percent,” NIFA said. “Despite the relatively low price and small market value, there have been massive trading volumes.”  The trading platforms have created the “false prosperity” in the crypto trading market by tempering statistics and using robots to increase trading volume. Some platforms have completely made up trading volume by copying other exchanges’ data, NIFA claimed.  See also:   ‘They Have the Users’: Binance CEO Explains Why He Bought CoinMarketCap The authority also accuses the trading platforms of misguiding investors by claiming virtual currencies are even safer than gold and silver to mitigate the volatility in the international financial market.  “After tricking investors into investing in crypto, some exchanges will manipulate the market through a range of trading techniques to take the investors’ assets,” NIFA said.  For example, exchanges can stop investors from trading by shutting off their systems, freezing assets or staging a system breakdown. Some investors would not be able to close a position and suffer a lot of losses, especially for those that trade with high leverage.   According to NIFA, the vast majority of crypto exchanges are based outside China since the government  banned trading activities  in 2017. As a result, it has been difficult for regulators to track down such institutions and retrieve losses for investors. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/04/02/chinese-financial-watchdog-warns-of-manipulative-crypto-exchanges/,coindesk,2020-04-02,22:00:00,en,354,2304,5.46045197740113,132,0.3728813559322034,national internet finance association nifa chinese financial watchdog warned investor rising risk crypto investment manipulation longstanding concern crypto investor nifa warning notable pushing narrative digital currency safe time global turmoil nifa regulatory organization affiliated central bank foreign based crypto exchange faked trading volume data analysis noted trading platform compared digital currency safe asset recent tumble crypto market caused significant loss investor sampling analysis based trading data exchange trading turnover rate coin percent coin rate exceeds percent nifa market massive trading volume trading platform created false prosperity crypto trading market tempering statistic robot increase trading volume platform completely made trading volume copying exchange data nifa claimed user binance ceo explains bought coinmarketcap authority accuses trading platform misguiding investor claiming virtual currency safer mitigate volatility international financial market tricking investor investing crypto exchange manipulate market trading technique investor asset nifa exchange stop investor trading shutting system freezing asset staging system breakdown investor position suffer lot loss trade leverage nifa vast majority crypto exchange based government banned trading activity result difficult regulator track institution retrieve loss investor,0.049999999999999996,positive,0.3684210526315789,"{'neg': 0.161, 'neu': 0.721, 'pos': 0.119, 'compound': -0.8225}",-0.8225,0.161,0.721,0.119,negative,-0.8181817809917372,0.13017751402261826,negative
binance, Follow up , Crypto Community Largely Approves of Binance Acquiring CoinMarketCap ,"Despite markets all over the world facing ever-worsening economic troubles amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, it seems as though the crypto industry has been able to weather the storm, at least thus far. In this regard,  Binance  — the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange — has recently  reached  an agreement to acquire  CoinMarketCap , one of the most prominent crypto data websites. The official announcement was made by both companies on April 2, with Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao  telling Cointelegraph that CMC and Binance have from the very start been working to make the crypto ecosystem more accessible to people all over the world. Additionally, he also believes that this latest deal will help the two companies build on each other’s strengths, as well as make the industry more transparent and approachable. Zhao further pointed out that his team had been in discussions with CMC for a few months and that he could not comment on the financial aspect of the deal since it has been legally secured using a non-disclosure agreement. With that being said, it is rumored that the buyout is worth an astonishing $400 million. What to make of it all? Providing his thoughts on the matter, Eric Benz, the CEO of Changelly, a crypto exchange, told Cointelegraph that having known the CoinMarketCap team for many years now, he is confident that this deal will benefit both parties. In his view, the timing of the agreement for Binance couldn’t have been better, as the impact of the coronavirus is being felt across many different industries. He added: “If there was any acquisition to be made in this crypto climate, then CMC was it. Binance has done a wonderful job to make this happen and also wish them the utmost success in making this platform even better for its users. On the one hand, it might appear to be a one-sided deal, but on the other, it shows just how important crypto market data is, and this is merely the beginning of the merger and acquisition phase of crypto.” A similar outlook is shared by Mike Alfred, the CEO and co-founder of Digital Assets Data, a fintech firm, who told Cointelegraph that Binance is among the strongest and most respected companies currently operating within the crypto ecosystem, and thus it came as no surprise that they are acting decisively during a period when many firms have become quite limited in their overall operational and financial capacities. Alfred further opined: “The deal is highly strategic on multiple levels and will put Binance in an even more powerful position relative to other exchanges when BTC heads back towards all-time highs.” Will the acquisition skew CMC’s operations?  Ever since the aforementioned news became mainstream, Binance has stated on several occasions that CMC will continue to operate as an independent business entity. In fact, CZ has claimed that the acquisition will not change CMC's independence from external stakeholders, suggesting that his company’s actions will not have any sort of impact on the data platform’s rankings whatsoever. However, in the short term, CMC will face minor internal restructuring, as the company’s founder and current CEO, Brandon Chez, will step down to be replaced by CMC’s current chief strategy officer, Carylyne Chan — who will serve as the interim CEO. According to David Wachsman, the founder and CEO of Wachsman, a blockchain PR firm, CMC’s new CEO, Carylyne Chan, has earned a global reputation as an executive who values transparency and fairness above all else. Moreover, from a commercial perspective, Wachsman told Cointelegraph that any skewing of results — on Binance’s behalf — would inevitably result in a deleterious effect on CMC's traffic, including the usage of the firm’s proprietary data in price oracles. Wachsman further added: “Binance’s acquisition of CoinMarketCap is a clear signal that major crypto media sites and trusted digital asset data companies –– those with strong numbers and a sticky user base –– have marketable equity value. Because of the executive team’s integrity and because the value of the CoinMarketCap property is based on trust in that data, I am convinced that CMC will stay the course as an independent organization.” Similarly, Erick Pinos, the American ecosystem lead at Ontology, a public blockchain project and distributed trust collaboration platform, told Cointelegraph that similar company acquisitions made by Binance in the past have until now continued to operate as separate entities. However, he did concede that most of these projects have ended up integrating one or more of Binance’s native offerings into their core service portfolio — Trust Wallet, for example, is a multi-token wallet that added Binance’s DEX after it was  bought  out by the crypto giant. Pinos further stated: “I would imagine there will be more links throughout CMC to Binance, perhaps encouraging users to sign up for Binance to trade the tokens they are looking at. If CMC’s rankings became partial to Binance, it would quickly be detected by the community. I think it’s likely that we will see Binance carry out subtle and small integrations over a longer period of time.” How does the buyout affect CMC and Binance? From a purely monetary perspective, the deal seems to make sense for CMC since the platform already has a steady revenue-generating business with its advertisements and paid API plans. Providing his technical insights on this issue, Jason Wu, the founder and CEO of DeFiner.org, a decentralized lending platform, told Cointelegraph that Binance is constantly looking for ways to penetrate the United States market. In this regard, he pointed out that in February 2020, CoinMarketCap registered 5.19 million visits from American users, which is roughly 14.1% of the company’s web traffic, while Binance only had 8% of its web traffic come from the U.S. — roughly translating to around 1.9 million web hits. He added:  “Acquiring CMC will help Binance grow its U.S. user base. For CMC, this acquisition will help them grow in other regions as well.” Additionally, Wachsman believes that CoinMarketCap now has an enviable array of options when it comes to becoming increasingly commercialized. For starters, as an online advertising platform, it is still a good option for those looking to get their message across to crypto enthusiasts in a multitude of regions. Moreover, Wachsman highlighted that financial support from Binance may only increase CMC’s attractiveness as well as turn the data platform into a major generator of leads for new registrants. Lastly, enumerating the reasons why Binance went ahead and bought CMC amid such uncertain times, Piers Ridyard, the CEO of Radix DLT, a high-throughput protocol, told Cointelegraph that Binance acquired CMC primarily because of two key factors: namely customer acquisition and data flow. He added: “While Binance will increase CMC’s brand equity as much as it can over the coming years, they will do that because of the huge benefit they reap in user acquisition and better data about the whole market. Another way of thinking about it is this vs. 10 years of Google Ad spending for Binance. $40M per year in ad spending is probably substantially cheap vs. their new cost per acquisition if Binance and the CMC team keep building the CMC brand.” Furthermore, Ridyard believes that CZ has a long-term plan in mind with respect to this acquisition, and as time passes, he will most likely use this opportunity to squeeze a number of his company’s core competitors out of the market. Also, he expects to see the industry continue on its current path of consolidation, wherein cash-rich buyers will continue to “snap up good strategic plays at cheaper prices.” Ridyard closed out by saying: “The CMC acquisition is likely firstly a data play — giving Binance some massively key insights into the market beyond its own user base. Beyond that, I think that CMC’s user-facing operations will be unchanged; for exchanges, the story might shift substantially in the next couple of years.” What Lies Ahead? Even though a huge portion of the global crypto community seems to believe that this latest acquisition by Binance is a sign of the crypto industry becoming stronger, Evgen Verzun, the founder of HyperSphere.AI, a decentralized cloud, told Cointelegraph that the deal is just a mere reflection of the coronavirus-induced economic crisis that is forcing investors and businesses to find new ways to save their money. The aforementioned comment seems to be in line with recent reports that  suggested  that CoinMarketCap had been facing quite a few financial constraints since 2019 — even forcing the company to carry out its day-to-day operations with minimal monetary resources. For example, in October 2019, Chan stated that CMC was going to  continue  with its policy of “bootstrapping and scaling” in the foreseeable future.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-largely-approves-of-binance-acquiring-coinmarketcap,cointelegraph,2020-04-04,00:00:00,en,1445,8876,5.132871972318339,596,0.4124567474048443,market

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptos Not Named Bitcoin This Week (Mar 29): XMR, BNB, HT, CRO, BSV ","Consumer attitudes are  changing  towards banknotes and credit cards as reports suggest that the deadly coronavirus can spread by their use. The Bank of International Settlements (BIS) has, therefore, urged the central banks to consider developing central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). BIS believes that under the current circumstance, CBDCs will quickly gain prominence. However, it has warned that this move could have a “severe impact on unbanked and older consumers.”   Chamath Palihapitiya, the billionaire CEO of venture capital firm Social Capital, believes that the setting is  right  for Bitcoin ( BTC ) to shine. However, he does not find Bitcoin as the right candidate to replace the U.S. dollar or other global currencies due to its volatility. Over the next ten years, Palihapitiya said that Bitcoin could be seen as a hedge against the failure of the traditional framework.  Crypto market data weekly view. Source:  Coin360 A recent  report  by Acuiti management intelligence platform showed a low level of adoption among the traditional trading firms (17%) compared to the sell-side service providers (26%). The report also found that security vulnerabilities of exchanges and fears of hacking were the biggest concerns that were holding back the trading institutions.  Nevertheless, there is hope for the future as 97% of the traditional trading firms that took part in the survey said that they are considering trading in digital assets within the next two years. For now, the  retail  traders seem to be holding the fort for cryptocurrencies. This early entry into a nascent asset class can turn out to be a massive wealth generator for the retail traders after institutions eventually jump in.   XMR/USD This is the second week that Monero ( XMR ) has been among the top performers. The privacy coin rallied about 18% in the past seven days and leads among altcoins but will XMR continue to rally into next week?  XMR-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview History suggests that the XMR/USD pair tends to find support or faces resistance at the 20-week exponential moving average (EMA), marked as ellipses on the chart. We anticipate the current relief rally to again face selling at the 20-week EMA, which is close to $61.6219, the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent downturn. Both moving averages are flattening out and the relative strength index (RSI) is just below the midpoint. This suggests that the selling pressure has reduced. Therefore, we expect the pair to either consolidate close to the 20-week EMA or dip to $44.50, which can be a good buying opportunity After a minor dip or consolidation, we anticipate the pair to resume its relief rally and scale above the 50-week simple moving average (SMA), which is close to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level. Above this level, a move to the downtrend line is possible.   Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the 20-week EMA and plummets below the $44.50-$38.30 support zone. However, we give this a low probability of occurring. BNB/USD This week media outlets reported that Binance, the world’s biggest cryptocurrency exchange, acquired CoinMarketCap in an undisclosed deal. In a separate announcement, Binance said that it plans to  hire  more than 100 new employees.  This shows that the crypto industry is growing in strength while the traditional industries are struggling during the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic.  Binance also announced its  entry  into the Korean market for the first time and has also hinted at  launching  Bitcoin options trading. While the fundamentals are strong for Binance Coin ( BNB ), does its technicals also indicate strength?  BNB-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The BNB/USD pair is in a downtrend as it has been trading inside a descending channel for the past few months. The 20-week EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the downside. Recently, the bulls defended the support line of the channel and are currently attempting to carry the pair to the resistance line of the channel. However, we expect the bears to mount a stiff resistance at the 20-week EMA.  If the price turns down from the 20-week EMA, a retest of the long-term trendline support, just above $8 is likely. If this support holds, it might offer a buying opportunity for more aggressive traders. On a break above the 20-week EMA and a move to the resistance line of the channel is likely. A breakout of the channel will indicate an end of the downtrend.  HT/USD Major cryptocurrency exchange Huobi has  partnered  with crypto lending platform Cred to offer its clients monthly interest payments on their pledged crypto assets. This could be an attraction as the central banks have been reducing interest rates across the world. After supporting China via its  donation , Huobi’s charity arm has announced an aid package of  $50,000  in Huobi Token ( HT ) to Indonesia to fight against the coronavirus. HT-USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The HT/USD pair is trading inside an ascending triangle. After sustaining the price above $3 for the past two weeks, the bulls have made a decisive move higher this week. Hence, in our  earlier  analysis, we had suggested that traders turn bullish after the price sustains above $3. This week, the bulls have pushed the price above both the 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA, which is a positive sign. The pair can now move up to $5.3506, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance. A break and close (UTC time) above $5.3506 will complete the ascending triangle setup that has a target objective of $10.1812.  Our bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support line of the ascending triangle. Such a move will invalidate the pattern, which will be a negative sign. Therefore, traders can close their positions if the price sustains below the triangle. CRO/USD Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) has been among the top performers for the third consecutive week. The payments and cryptocurrency platform has  waived  off the 3.5% credit/debit card fees charged for cryptocurrency purchases for the next three months. Additionally, for the same time period, the company has increased rewards on the purchase of groceries.  CRO-USD weekly chart. Source:  Tradingview The bulls are struggling to sustain the CRO/USD pair above the 50-week SMA at $0.0485. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level.  The 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA have flattened out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between buyers and sellers. If the price turns down from the current levels, the pair is likely to remain range-bound between $0.0245 and $0.05 for a few days. A break below $0.0245 will be a huge negative. On the other hand, if the bulls can propel and sustain the pair above the 50-week SMA, a move to $0.060 and above it to $0.080 is possible. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) rounded up the list of the top five performers of the past seven days. The altcoin will undergo a block reward halving in less than five days. Coin Metrics believes that this will drive the miners to direct  more  hash power to Bitcoin as its halving is still more than a month away.  BSV-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the bears are aggressively defending the overhead resistance at $185.87. The 20-week EMA and the 50-week SMA have flattened out and the RSI is at the midpoint. This points to a consolidation in the short-term. If the price turns down from the current levels, it might remain range-bound between $146.96 and $185.87 for a few more days. A breakdown of the support at $146.96 will signal weakness and can extend the fall to the next support at $78.506. Conversely, if the pair closes (UTC time) above $187.87, a rally to $233.314 and $268.842 is possible. Both levels are at the 50% and 61.8% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent correction. Traders could turn bullish if the price sustains above $187.87 and they are likely to remain bearish if the price breaks below $146.

binance,Markets,Poloniex's New Tron-Powered IEO Platform Moves Exchange Closer to Justin Sun's Orbit,"Poloniex has launched an initial exchange offering (IEO) platform that aligns the exchange more closely with the interests of Tron founder  Justin Sun .  Seychelles-based Poloniex – acquired by a group of investors including  Sun  in 2019 – said Sunday the new IEO platform, dubbed LaunchBase, would serve as a springboard to ""help quality blockchain projects grow and further develop their ecosystem."" The IEO platform, together with ""launch partner"" Tron, will promote user adoption through distributing tokens and professional consultation, Poloniex said in a  blog post.  Notably, the exchange said Tron's TRX cryptocurrency would be the only eligible cryptocurrency for purchasing new tokens on LaunchBase. Further, the first company scheduled for a sale will be the Tron-based stablecoin lending platform JUST.  The blog announcement is unclear whether LaunchBase is exclusively for Tron startups, or whether projects based on alternative protocols are also welcome.  ""Huge congrats on launching Poloniex LaunchBase, a world-leading token sale platform! As Poloniex’s strategic partner, Tron Foundation and I will fully support the LaunchBase platform and its future development,""  Sun said on Twitter , Sunday. Similar to an initial coin offering, an IEO is a crowdfunding tool for cryptocurrency startups, with an exchange acting as a trusted broker offering the token sale. The exchange also provides a proprietary token to execute the sale, in this case TRX.  For more on IEOs, check our  video explainer . Poloniex used to be one of the largest exchanges on the block. At one point, 50 percent of all crypto payments went through Poloniex servers. This continued even after payments app Circle bought the exchange for a  reported $400 million.  By the time the exchange  spun out again , it only made up one percent of the total market volume.  Although Sun first denied reports he was involved in the investment group that purchased Poloniex last year, he  confirmed it later  at an event live streamed on Twitter. It's unclear who else was in the investment group, or how much sway the 29-year-old Sun has within it.  Sun has a history of taking over distressed companies. In 2018 he purchased the internet file-sharing platform BitTorrent, which, according to sources speaking to  TechCrunch , had long been looking for a buyer.  Initial uneasiness  about the acquisition appeared to materialize this January when some former BitTorrent employees  sued Sun  and the new management team for allegedly subjecting them to harassment and bullying for not releasing software updates fast enough.    See also:  Poloniex Drops KYC for Withdrawals Below $10,000 Following US Exit   Earlier this year,  Sun also bought Steemit,  the most popular app on the struggling blockchain-based blogging network Steem. A power struggle between Sun and the Steem community quickly ensued, which eventually led to a  community hard fork  in attempt to move away from Sun. Both Poloniex and Binance staked tokens in support of Sun, but Binance founder Changpeng Zhao later  apologized  to the Steemit community for aiding and abetting a ""hostile takeover."" Despite Sun's claims that Poloniex operates independently to the Tron Foundation, the relationship between the two remains hazy. Sun appears to have active influence over Poloniex, having announced a TRX20 airdrop campaign for Poloniex users during the same speech in which he said he'd bought the exchange.

binance, News , Cryptocurrency Exchange OKEx Tackles Small Balances With New Offering ,"Cryptocurrency exchange OKEx announced a new feature that allows its users to convert small balances to the firm’s proprietary token OKB. OKEx  announced  on April 7 that the new product allows its user to convert all the crypto asset balances worth less than 0.001 Bitcoin ( BTC ) ($7.38 at press time) into OKB. The upper limit for conversion value is 0.01 BTC ($73.84 at press time), there is no limit on conversion time but the conversion is only available when the price fluctuates within 5%. A trader told Cointelegraph that small balance handling is an important feature for long-term traders because it prevents users from wasting resources when trading several different assets. He said that small balances are a big issue on crypto exchanges “because they are funds that cannot be used” to trade. A broom for cryptocurrency ""dust"" Binance has a similar feature letting users convert small balances — often called dust —  into its proprietary token Binance Coin ( BNB ). When the feature first launched in late April 2018, Binance co-founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao  joked  on Twitter, “I hear the team has built a broom, who wants it?” Just like BNB, OKB allows users to pay less for fees on the trading platform. In a Feb. 16  post , OKEx explains some of the advantages that OKB holders have on its exchange: “There is only one trading fee discount program for OKB holders on OKEx, in which users only need to hold 500 OKBs to enjoy fee discounts. To receive the maximum discount, users only need to hold a maximum of 2000 OKBs.” OKEx CEO Jay Hao urged traders to avoid speculating on OKB, stating, ""A principle that I recommend all our users stick to is that if you do not fully believe in the long term growth of OKEx, then please do not trade OKB.” The rise of OKEx Over the past year, OKEx significantly grew in importance within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. As Cointelegraph  reported  at the end of March, OKEx recently became the world’s top Bitcoin Futures exchange by daily trading volume, overtaking industry veteran BitMEX. Hao presumably believes that OKEx's competitors do not appreciate the growth of his platform; in February he  blamed them  for denial of service attacks against the exchange.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/cryptocurrency-exchange-okex-tackles-small-balances-with-new-offering,cointelegraph,2020-04-07,00:00:00,en,380,2221,4.821052631578947,137,0.3605263157894737,cryptocurrency exchange okex announced feature user convert balance firm proprietary token okb okex announced product user convert crypto asset balance bitcoin btc press time okb upper limit conversion btc press time limit conversion time conversion fluctuates trader told cointelegraph balance handling important feature term trader prevents user wasting resource trading asset balance big issue crypto exchange fund trade cryptocurrency dust binance similar feature letting user convert balance called dust proprietary token binance coin bnb feature launched late binance founder ceo changpeng joked twitter hear team built bnb okb user pay fee trading platform okex explains advantage okb holder exchange trading discount program okb holder okex user hold okbs enjoy discount receive maximum discount user hold maximum okbs okex ceo hao urged trader avoid speculating okb stating principle recommend user stick fully term growth okex trade okb rise okex past okex significantly grew importance cryptocurrency ecosystem cointelegraph reported end okex recently world top bitcoin future exchange trading volume overtaking industry veteran bitmex hao belief okex competitor growth platform blamed denial service attack exchange,0.07115384615384615,positive,0.38461538461538464,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.785, 'pos': 0.151, 'compound': 0.921}",0.921,0.064,0.785,0.151,positive,-0.599999940000006,0.06097560938429507,negative
binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin (BNB) Monthly Gain Exceeds 151% as Cartesi IEO Approaches ,"Since dropping to a 2020 low at $6.34 on March 13, Binance Coin ( BNB ) has been on an absolute tear, gaining 151.48% to reach a 4-week high at $15.93. Unlike Chainlink ( LINK ), the recovery has been slow and steady as BNB flipped systematically flipped multiple resistance levels to support.  Aside from the strong oversold bounce that saw many cryptocurrencies snatch back the majority of their March 13 losses,  news  that Binance exchange will host an IEO for Cartesi starting April 21 could be partially responsible for the most recent leg of the pump to $15.93.  Many Binance IEOs require investors to use BNB to participate so this along with the hype building up around the event could be fueling BNB purchases. Crypto market daily performance. Source:  Coin360 On the daily timeframe, one can see that the current progression took place on multiple days of strong buy volume. Currently the relative strength index is at 60, projecting higher into bullish territory, and the Chaikin Money Flow shows buyers remain interested in BNB.  BNB USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView The price found resistance at the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level ($15.87) which is to be expected after such an impressive run but there is also support at $15.33 where there is a high volume VPVR node.  Below this level there is also support at $15 and if a deeper pullback ensued traders will look to $14.06, a point which is aligned with the 50% Fibonacci retracement level. A drop below the 50% Fib level would also break through the rising wedge support but the VPVR shows buying interest at $12.23.  One could also argue that on the daily timeframe BNB is trading within a rising wedge with a target at $19.45 and $22. Given that the 61.8% Fib level is acting as resistance, a likely short-term scenario is a retest of $14.50, followed by a successful push above $15.87 (61.8%) to $17.22 then a breakout to the targets mentioned earlier.  Basically, all the supports are lined up with the Fib levels so traders should mind trading volume and the pattern of higher lows.  BNB/BTC BTC BTC daily chart. Source:  TradingView In its Bitcoin ( BTC ) pair, BNB has rallied 35.88% off its March 13 bottom at 0.0016671 Satoshis and currently the set up looks appetizing. After reaching a 4-week high at 0.0023029 sats  BNB pulled back to the 61.8% Fib level at 0.0022557 sats, but surging buy volume suggests bulls have little intention of slowing down.  The daily timeframe shows a strong surge in momentum on the MACD histogram and the relative strength index is steadily pushing above 70. Should BNB price push above 0.0023289 sats then 0.0026273 sats is the next target.   BTC BTC 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView While the BNB/BTC pair looks tasty on the daily timeframe, there are a few notes of caution presented by the 4-hour chart. Should BNB lose the 61.8% Fib level as support and fall below 0.0022328 sats, there is a volume gap on the VPVR from 0.0022328 sats to 0.0020809 sats a 6.63% drop.  Given that the 4-hour RSI is overbought and the MACD is at its highest level since February, a pullback to the 50% Fib level and possibly the 0.0020642 sats support at the ascending trendline could occur over the short term.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the  author  and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: ETH, XTZ, LINK, BNB, DASH ","With Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) halving less than 23 days away, traders would like to go into the event with strong bullish sentiment but this is yet to be determined. If Bitcoin is able to breakout and sustain above its overhead resistance, it is likely to pull the crypto markets higher. The first sign of strength would be if the total market capitalization can sustain above the  $211  billion mark. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Although Bitcoin is the leader, there are a few altcoins that are showing promise and could outperform the largest cryptocurrency next week. Here are the top 5 cryptocurrencies that could offer short-term trading opportunities in the next few days. ETH/USD After repeatedly facing resistance at $176.103 (shown via ellipses on the chart), Ether ( ETH ) broke out of the overhead resistance on April 18 with strength. This is a positive sign as it shows that the bulls are keen to buy at every higher level. ETH-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Both the 10-day EMA ($169) and the 20-day SMA ($158) are sloping up and the RSI has been trading in positive territory for the past few days. This suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. The previous resistance of $176.103 is now likely to act as a strong support. If this level holds, the ETH/USD pair is likely to scale above $189.402, which is just above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the fall from $251.781-$87.131. ETH-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the ETH/USD pair is attempting to bounce off the 20-SMA. If successful, the bulls will again attempt to push the price above $189.402. Traders can buy on a 4-hourly close (UTC time) above $189.402 and keep the stop loss below the 20-SMA. On the upside, the first target objective is a rally to $208.665. As the price nears the target objective, traders can either book partial profits or trail the stop loss below the 10-EMA. The bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the critical support zone of $176-$168. XTZ/USD Tezos ( XTZ ) rallied on April 18 and scaled above the minor resistance at $2.1819. This is a positive sign as it shows demand at higher levels. The bears are attempting to stall the pullback close to $2.4072688, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent fall. XTZ-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. The previous resistance of $2.1819 is now likely to act as a strong support. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has been trading in the positive territory for the past few days, which shows that the bulls are in command. The XTZ/USD pair has repeatedly taken support on the 20-day SMA ($1.92) in the past few days (marked via ellipse on the chart), which shows that the bulls are keen to buy on dips. The short-term uptrend is likely to pick up momentum above $2.40726880. XTZ-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Currently, the bulls are attempting to provide support at the 20-SMA. If the altcoin bounces off this support and scales above $2.40726880, a rally to $2.55 and above it to $2.70 will be on the cards. Therefore, traders can buy at $2.41 and trail the stop loss below the 20-SMA. As the price nears the first target, partial profits can be booked and the stops on the rest of the position can be trailed just below the 10-EMA. If the bears sink the price below the immediate support at $2.1819, it will indicate profit booking and shorting at higher levels. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) scaled above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $3.5948 on April 18, which is a bullish sign. Usually, when the relief rally climbs above the 61.8% retracement, it is an indication that the downtrend is over. LINK-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They are currently attempting to sink the LINK/USD pair back below $3.5948. If successful, the pair might dip to the 10-day EMA ($3.36), which is likely to act as a support. Since March 31, the bears have not been able to sustain the price below the 10-day EMA, which is a positive sign. This shows that the bulls are keen to buy on dips to this level. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI trading in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls. LINK-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The altcoin has dipped below the breakout level of $3.6412, which shows selling at higher levels. However, the bulls are attempting to defend the critical support at $3.48, which had previously acted as a stiff resistance (marked as ellipse on the chart). If the pair bounces off this level and breaks above $3.83, a rally to $4.20 and above it to $4.40 is possible. Traders can initiate long positions above $3.83 with stops placed below the 20-SMA. Partial profits can be booked near the first resistance and the stops on the rest can be trailed to just below the 10-EMA. Traders can either book complete profits at $4.40 or tighten the stops further. The bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the $3.48-$3.30 support zone. Below this level, a drop to $3 is possible. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) broke above the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement but the bears are offering stiff resistance at $16.60, which is the intraday high made on March 12. BNB-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview However, if the BNB/USD pair rebounds off $15.8866 and sustains above $16.60, it is likely to pick up momentum. With both moving averages sloping up and the RSI in the positive territory, the advantage is with the bulls. Conversely, if the bears sink the pair below $15.8866, a drop to the 10-day EMA ($15.36) and below it to the 20-day SMA ($14.51) is possible. So far the bulls have not allowed the price to slip below the 20-day SMA since March 31. Hence, it is expected that this level will act as a strong support. BNB-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview If the pair rebounds off $15.8866, the bulls will attempt to resume the up move and propel the price above $16.8183. Above this level, the momentum is likely to pick up and a rally to $18.50 will be on the cards. Traders can buy above $16.85 and keep a stop loss of $15.85. After the price scales above $17.50, the stops can be trailed just below the 10-EMA. If the momentum carries the price above $18.50, a rally to $20 is also possible. However, if the price dips and sustains below $15.8866, a drop to the trendline is possible. This has previously acted as strong support, hence, a bounce off the trendline can also offer a buying opportunity with the stops kept just below the trendline. A break below the trendline will be a bearish sign and can result in a deeper fall. DASH/USD Dash ( DASH ) broke above the overhead resistance of $77.7166, which completed the ascending triangle pattern. However, the bears are aggressively defending $84.2556, which is the intraday high made on April 9. DASH-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview If the bears sink and sustain the DASH/USD pair below $77.7166, a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle is possible. A break below this level will invalidate the bullish setup. Conversely, if the pair turns around from the current levels and scales above $84.2556, it is likely to pick up momentum. The moving averages are gradually sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have a slight edge. DASH-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview If the pair bounces off the support at $77.7166, the bulls will attempt to propel the price above $84.2556. Traders can buy 50% of the desired position at $82 and the rest at $85. The stops can be kept below the 20-SMA. After the price sustains above $85, a rally to $94 followed by a move to $100 is possible. On the other hand, if the price dips below $77.7166, a drop to the trendline of the ascending triangle is possible. If the pair bounces off this level, this can also offer a low-risk buying opportunity with the stops placed just below the trendline. The bullish view will be invalidated if the altcoin dips below the trendline.

binance, News , Crypto Community Slams Binance Smart Chain Over Centralization ,"Many crypto analysts have criticized the whitepaper for Binance’s forthcoming ‘ Smart Chain ’, which was published on April 17. Smart Chain will be Binance’s second smart contract-enabled chain after Binance Chain. It offers the additions of full compatibility with Ethereum ( ETH ) and a delegated proof-of-stake, or DPoS, governance system with 21 node operators elected by Binance Coin ( BNB ) holders. ‘Binance Smart Chain’ garners luke-warm reception The whitepaper for Binance’s forthcoming Smart Chain received mixed reactions. Many in the crypto community posit that the chain will recycle the features of existing projects without bringing anything new to the crypto asset ecosystem. On Twitter, crypto data aggregator Messari  stated : “‘Binance Smart Chain’ looks like another ETH competitor in an already crowded field,” adding that the chain will feature an “EOS-like” DPoS system. Reddit user ‘Always_Question’  described  the whitepaper as outlining “Yet another Chinese copy-cat, this time of EOS DPOS--one of the largest $2 billion nothing burgers ever built.” Speaking to Cointelegraph Jim Blasko of Ethereum-powered virtual world Voxels criticized the Smart Chain’s DPoS algorithm, stating, “Proof-of-stake is really just meant to eliminate traditional mining, which I still believe is crucial to a fully operational blockchain albeit public or private, decentralized or centralized, and or even permissioned.” DPoS governance as prone to centralization In an essay shared with Cointelegraph, the co-founder of digital asset research firm Delphi Digital, Tom Shaughnessy, argues that Smart Chain will be hampered by centralization: “While a high profile launch, Binance Smart Chain may be in competition with Ethereum and other programmable blockchains for clicks and eyeball time, but it is certainly not a competitor for building the decentralized future.” Shaughnessy predicts that Smart Chain’s governance allows “CZ [to] likely reign control over the chain given his influence and his BNB stake,” criticizing centralized platforms:  “Centralized chains miss the point, every time. The point is not to offer cheaper transactions, anyone can do this using Amazon Web Services, but to foster a community-driven ethos of builders who enjoy working together without a centrally derived mandate.” Centralization stifles creativity Delphi’s co-founder states that decentralized chains are able to foster impressive applications because developers ""have a new sandbox to innovate in with new tools to play with,” adding that “they are no longer bound by the Web 2.0 design space of the past.” “Once you bring a developer back into a centralized sandbox, the game plan is to usually bring an existing Web 2.0 app to the chain, promote it as decentralized and fade into irrelevance."" “Building global applications from a laptop and an internet connection to exist forever and be iterated on by a global community loses its flare once you say its pulse is controlled by 21 nodes and the opinion of Binance management,” he adds. Despite his criticism, Shaughnessy cautions: “It would be naive to dismiss the resources Binance can put behind this initiative from a monetary perspective and a community one.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-community-slams-binance-smart-chain-over-centralization,cointelegraph,2020-04-26,00:00:00,en,490,3218,5.561224489795919,163,0.3326530612244898,crypto analyst criticized whitepaper binance forthcoming chain published chain binance contract enabled chain binance chain offer addition full compatibility ethereum eth delegated proof stake dpos governance system node operator elected binance coin bnb holder binance chain garner warm reception whitepaper binance forthcoming chain received mixed reaction crypto community posit chain recycle feature existing project bringing crypto asset ecosystem twitter crypto data aggregator messari stated binance chain eth competitor crowded adding chain feature eos dpos system reddit user question whitepaper outlining chinese copy cat time eos dpos largest burger built speaking cointelegraph blasko ethereum powered virtual world voxels criticized chain dpos algorithm stating proof stake meant eliminate traditional mining crucial fully operational blockchain albeit public private decentralized centralized permissioned dpos governance prone centralization essay shared cointelegraph founder digital asset research firm delphi digital shaughnessy argues chain hampered centralization profile launch binance chain competition ethereum programmable blockchains click eyeball time competitor building decentralized future shaughnessy predicts chain governance cz reign control chain influence bnb stake criticizing centralized platform centralized chain point time point offer cheaper transaction amazon web service community driven ethos builder enjoy working centrally derived mandate centralization stifle creativity delphi founder state decentralized chain impressive application developer sandbox innovate tool play adding longer bound web design space past bring developer centralized sandbox game plan bring existing web app chain promote decentralized fade irrelevance building global application laptop internet connection exist forever iterated global community loses flare pulse controlled node opinion binance management add criticism shaughnessy caution naive dismiss resource binance put initiative monetary perspective community,0.04285714285714285,positive,0.36269841269841274,"{'neg': 0.062, 'neu': 0.838, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.872}",0.872,0.062,0.838,0.1,positive,-0.29999998500000075,0.08298755152287324,negative
binance,Markets,Binance CEO Says Steem Too Centralized but Exchange Must Support Controversial Hard Fork,"Binance  is forced to ""technically"" support last week's hard fork of the Steem blockchain, according to the crypto exchange's CEO, Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao. In a  statement on the company's official blog  Sunday, CZ said that while the exchange is ""very much against zeroing other people’s assets on the blockchain,"" to not support it would mean  Binance  users would not be able to withdraw their steem tokens. The result of a dispute in the Steem community over the acquisition of SteemIt – the blockchain ecosystem's biggest and most powerful application – by Tron and Justin Sun, the hard fork was used as a tool to  strip 64 dissenters of their token holdings . At the time around $6.3 million worth of cryptocurrency was grabbed, with one of the affected parties, Dan Hensley, saying he alone had lost around $1 million of the total.  Wiping out people's token holdings ""goes against the very ethos of blockchain and decentralization,"" said CZ. The fact this can happen on a blockchain means it is overly centralized."" The fork put Binance in a ""tricky"" situation, he continued. While the exchange would not otherwise support the fork, ""if we don’t support it (technically), no users can withdraw any STEEM coins."" CZ explained Binance had waited to see how other exchanges reacted to the fork, saying that soon some had enabled the upgrade. He added users had been demanding support for the fork, too. Reading between the lines, CZ appears to be encouraging users to withdraw their steem tokens, mentioning several times in the post that supporting the fork would allow withdrawals – of course, it could allow continued holding or trading too. ""We do not want to block people’s funds. In this case, we should allow users to withdraw their funds, whether we willingly support this hard fork or not,"" reads one of his lines. The issue of the hard fork – launched apparently with the sole purpose of confiscating the holdings of key community members who were unhappy with Justin Sun's power in the ecosystem and how he was wielding it – followed a previous hard fork that saw some Steem users  create a new blockchain called Hive . The new chain copied over all the tokens from Steem, but not those of Sun and some Steem witnesses. While the tit-for-tat fork may seem to some a fair reprisal, it's worth noting that Hive's tokens were effectively a free copy, while original holdings on Steem were obtained through genuine investments.  In the post, CZ notes crypto advocate and author Andreas Antonopoulos had suggested in a tweet that Steem's latest fork  would likely result in litigation , with supporting exchanges also to be included as defendants. The Binance CEO said: ""I would have thought that [a class-action lawsuit] would go against everything he is preaching. In a decentralized world, anyone should be able to support any fork. Exchanges providing choices for users to get a 'forked coin' is no different by definition."" The Steem saga illustrates that decentralization is not a utopia and that the community must work together ""build a healthier decentralized ecosystem,"" he concluded.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/05/25/binance-ceo-says-steem-too-centralized-but-exchange-must-support-controversial-hard-fork/,coindesk,2020-05-25,09:34:00,en,519,3101,4.957610789980732,210,0.4046242774566474,binance forced technically support hard fork steem blockchain crypto exchange ceo changpeng cz statement company official blog cz exchange zeroing people asset blockchain support binance user withdraw steem token result dispute steem community acquisition steemit blockchain ecosystem biggest powerful application tron hard fork tool strip dissenter token holding time cryptocurrency grabbed affected party lost total wiping people token holding ethos blockchain decentralization cz fact happen blockchain overly centralized fork put binance tricky situation continued exchange support fork support technically user withdraw steem coin cz explained binance waited exchange reacted fork enabled upgrade added user demanding support fork reading line cz appears encouraging user withdraw steem token mentioning time supporting fork withdrawal continued holding trading people fund user withdraw fund willingly support hard fork read line issue hard fork launched apparently sole purpose confiscating holding community member unhappy ecosystem wielding previous hard fork steem user create blockchain called hive chain copied token steem steem witness tit tat fork reprisal noting hive token effectively copy original holding steem obtained genuine investment cz note crypto advocate author antonopoulos suggested tweet steem latest fork result litigation supporting exchange included defendant binance ceo thought class action lawsuit preaching decentralized world support fork exchange providing choice user forked coin definition steem saga illustrates decentralization utopia community work build healthier decentralized ecosystem concluded,0.023809523809523787,positive,0.49880952380952387,"{'neg': 0.104, 'neu': 0.717, 'pos': 0.179, 'compound': 0.9698}",0.9698,0.104,0.717,0.179,positive,-0.39999996000000404,0.0495049502499755,negative
binance,Business,Brazilian Retailer Eyes Services for the Unbanked With Acquisition of FinTech Firm Airfox,"Brazilian retail firm Via Varejo has scooped up Boston-based fintech startup Airfox for an undisclosed sum.  The acquisition comes as part of plans by Via Varejo to provide financial services to millions of Brazilians who lack the means to obtain traditional bank accounts, according to a statement  released Friday . The two firms already have a relationship. In June 2019, they launched banQi, a mobile digital banking app in partnership with Mastercard. The app enables customers to use money in their banQi accounts to pay for goods and services in their communities, as well as online and anywhere globally where Mastercard is accepted.  See also:  Solana Blockchain Adds Korean Stablecoin Terra for Better Payments Victor Santos, CEO and co-founder at Airfox, told CoinDesk that Airfox's intention is to provide free bank accounts with ""superior services."" As more people bank with the firm, the more affordable credit and adjacent financial services become, he said. ""We can use data from [banQi users] smartphone and behavior within our app to assess credit and give credit digitally. This is something traditional banks struggle with,"" according to Santos. Airfox, which employs around 35 staff, will retain its Boston headquarters and will serve as a “fintech innovation hub.” Airfox suffered a setback in 2018  after it was ordered to comply and register its initial coin offering (ICO)with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In order to settle charges that the regulator previously contended were a breach of securities rules, Airfox agreed to refund investors, file periodic reports to the SEC and pay $250,000 after it was revealed it had raised $15 million through its ICO sale. See also:  Binance-Backed Crypto Payments App Launches as Race for Africa Heats Up Looking to a brighter future, Santos explained the acquisition by Via Vajero would bring benefits to the Boston-based fintech. According to a recent study  by Brazilian research firm, Locomotiva Institute, around 45 million Brazilians do not have a bank account or are considered unbanked in a population totaling 209 million people. ""We can have structural advantages of using Via Varejo resources, retail locations, customers, credit and financial service portfolio to accelerate our product and strategy,"" he said. ""Airfox is unique with this partnership because we are the only digital bank in the country with access to 1,000+ retail stores from ViaVarejo that almost function as a branch for our users to go in,"" Santos said.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/27/brazilian-retailer-eyes-services-for-the-unbanked-with-acquisition-of-fintech-firm-airfox/,coindesk,2020-05-27,08:31:00,en,398,2519,5.314070351758794,144,0.36180904522613067,brazilian retail firm varejo scooped based fintech startup airfox undisclosed sum acquisition part plan varejo provide financial service million brazilian lack obtain traditional bank account statement released firm relationship launched banqi mobile digital banking app partnership mastercard app enables customer banqi account pay good service community online globally mastercard accepted solana blockchain add korean stablecoin payment ceo founder airfox told coindesk airfox intention provide bank account superior service people bank firm affordable credit adjacent financial service data banqi user smartphone behavior app ass credit give credit digitally traditional struggle airfox employ staff retain headquarters serve fintech innovation hub airfox suffered setback ordered comply initial coin offering ico security exchange commission sec order charge regulator previously contended breach security rule airfox agreed refund investor file periodic report sec pay revealed raised ico binance backed crypto payment app launch africa heat brighter future explained acquisition vajero bring benefit based fintech recent study brazilian research firm locomotiva institute brazilian bank account considered unbanked population totaling people structural advantage varejo resource retail location customer credit financial service portfolio accelerate product strategy airfox unique partnership digital bank country access retail store viavarejo function user,0.02896825396825396,positive,0.3496031746031746,"{'neg': 0.064, 'neu': 0.76, 'pos': 0.176, 'compound': 0.9661}",0.9661,0.064,0.76,0.176,positive,-0.16666665277777895,0.07017543818610855,negative
binance,Business,Behind 'Prime Broker' Buzzword Lies a Complex Strategy Game for Crypto Firms,"It’s probably no coincidence that three major crypto firms – Coinbase, Genesis Trading and BitGo – have almost simultaneously announced plans to become prime brokers, a kind of fixer when it comes to financing and facilitating trades for institutional investors. This type of vertical integration happens in every business, whether that’s Amazon running the internet or Coinbase trying to own the crypto space. Given the long road of the last couple of years, it’s maybe surprising there hasn’t been more M&A activity in the blockchain world.   The big news this week was  Coinbase’s acquisition  of trading technology and execution platform Tagomi.  BitGo Prime  also launched its recently announced lending business and bolted on tax-reporting company Lumina. Last week, Genesis Trading (a subsidiary of CoinDesk parent firm Digital Currency Group)  bought crypto custody provider Vo1t  and spun up “Genesis Prime.”  Read more:  Coinbase Buys Tagomi as ‘Foundation’ of Institutional Trading Arm From starting out as a retail-focused cryptocurrency exchange, or a wallet provider, or an OTC desk, the ambitions of these firms ( and others ) to become crypto’s prime brokers is aspirational at this stage, as observers like BlockWorks Group co-founder  Jason Yanowitz  have noted. Indeed, the term “prime broker” is suddenly the latest buzzword in crypto, observed Max Boonen, CEO of cryptocurrency liquidity provider B2C2. “What puzzles me a little bit is that some people are getting into prime brokerage, not based on a vision, but really because they are looking for the next big thing – and they don’t know what it is. So they are going after the buzzword,” said Boonen.  
 
 In traditional capital markets, the term “prime broker” refers to a set of three or four features or components that are normally provided by investment banks to their hedge funds clients.  Top of the list is the financing prime brokers supply to hedge funds to get leverage into their positions, and lending where people running a long/short fund are able to borrow the shorts. Operational efficiency in the traditional world is perhaps overshadowed by the importance of custody in the crypto space, and the final component is providing “best execution,” achieved by tapping a range of liquidity providers and exchanges. Before Coinbase’s acquisition of Tagomi, there were “precisely zero” firms that had all of the above components, said Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, a trading technology and execution provider in the same vein as Tagomi. “If I were in [Kraken CEO] Jesse Powell’s shoes, or if I were Bitstamp or the Winklevoss twins, I would look at the Coinbase-Tagomi deal and say, ‘Hmm, this is the technology we need,’” said Weisberger.  An obvious question is, why now?  “There is sort of a coincidental element that all of this happened to land in the same week or two,” said Genesis CEO Michael Moro, “but from an industry trend and directional perspective, I think it makes all the sense in the world.” Deep pockets No doubt there are gaps in Coinbase’s growing institutional franchise that have yet to be cinched together, noted Weisberger.  “But when it comes to trade execution, Tagomi has that and also the tech to facilitate lending,” he said. “Coinbase has deep pockets and, with custody, the ability to have lendable coins. So they just have to combine all that intelligently.” Boonen of B2C2, which is listed as the top liquidity provider on the Tagomi platform, pointed to financing and leverage as the crucial piece of the puzzle still missing from Coinbase’s plans.  “One of the things that a lot of participants say is missing from Tagomi is the provision of credit, and it’s also something that Coinbase doesn’t do,” said Boonen. “It’s a friction at Coinbase because of their regulatory setup, which obviously has benefits in one sense, but on the other hand it limits them in terms of providing leverage.” In order to be a full-fledged prime broker, this obvious gap has to be plugged. “One of the core drawbacks with Tagomi, is also not a strength of Coinbase. I do feel at the moment it’s aspirational in terms of being a prime broker,” Boonen said. Read more:  Crypto and the Latency Arms Race: Market Microstructures Genesis Trading, which has  loaned digital assets valued at $6.2 billion  to institutional borrowers since launching its lending business in March 2018, said the availability of credit is more important than smarts, especially for firms that are used to trading on margin. “We are building all of those fancy trading systems in-house; there’s no question that we are,” said Moro. “But that’s secondary to what we do and certainly not the reason somebody would use Genesis.”  jwplayer(""jw-video-hb7TAYH2"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/hb7TAYH2""}) Crypto conflicts Tagomi’s management has informed its clients it will not deviate from the overarching business plan, including routing orders to multiple liquidity sources, Boonen said. Tagomi aggregates exchanges such as Bitstamp, Gemini and Binance US, as well as a handful of over-the-counter market makers, to scout out the best prices for its clientele of traders.  It’s possible to run a best-execution agency as a separate entity, but prime brokers have a privileged position with their customers including access to their trading strategies and material, non-public information about them. Technically, a conflict of interest can be avoided, said Boonen. The question is whether it will be done in practice. “It’s also about whether other exchanges being aggregated still want to do that,” Boonen said. “Obviously, you are happy to work with Tagomi because they are an independent business, but what does it mean when they belong to Coinbase, which is a direct competitor to you?” Weisberger of CoinRoutes said there are information barriers and procedures that can be put in place to remove any conflict of interest but it remains “a very interesting discussion” that speaks to a broader disparity between crypto and traditional markets trading.  Read more:  Crypto Long & Short: Innovation Cycles, Crypto Venture Funds and Institutional Investors “If I were Binance US, I would have no qualms about Tagomi providing liquidity and accessing liquidy on Binance US; if I were Bitstamp I’d have no qualms,” said Weisberger. “I would, moreover, expect that they would then go over to Coinbase Pro and say, ‘OK, guys, we want to have a unit that can access liquidity on your platforms.’” The growth of exchange groups like Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) or Nasdaq in the equities markets was because these firms had to allow their competitors to access their quotes and had to allow their competitors to route business to them, Weisberger pointed out, and in the end the whole market benefits as a result. “Wall Street and the City of London are thought of as the most bare-knuckle capitalists out there,” said Weisberger. “But there are areas where people work with their competitors to make the overall business better, and areas where they compete like hell. Silicon Valley has a different mentality where you have to simply out-compete everyone, and the crypto industry may be the same right now.”  Binance and Bitstamp did not reply to requests for comment. Last man standing Technical and regulatory challenges around the safe storage of crypto assets have seen numerous custody providers spring up with various solutions and services on offer. It’s probably going to be the case that more of these highly specialized firms will be snapped up by bigger players, similar to the Vo1t acquisition. “I think standalone custody businesses are going to be difficult to sustain,” said Moro of Genesis. “Custodial fees are shrinking; it’s a race to zero. So I think standalone custodians are going to partner up with companies that have other business lines, or they will look to start other business lines.”  Nick Carmi, BitGo’s head of financial services, agreed consolidation is well underway.  “This is exactly what happened in the financial markets as well, where custody is provided by few very large custodians,” he said. Read more:  BitGo Cements Hold on Institutional Market With Lumina Acquisition As far as broadening out, Carmi said BitGo Prime was always part of the vision, driven by optimism in crypto as much as anything else. Taking a jab at Coinbase’s Tagomi deal, Carmi emphasized the importance of not being an exchange when it comes to offering brokerage services.  “We are not an exchange, we enable connections to multiple exchanges and market makers on a full non-disclosed basis. It is important to partition certain functions in order to have a secure and efficient financial infrastructure for digital assets,” said Carmi. BitGo acquired some trading capabilities from last month’s purchase of Lumina, Carmi said, without disclosing any trading or lending volumes.   Meanwhile, some firms are still operating on the premise this is the Wild West and they will make a lot of money, said Boonen, but as the crypto market tightens and becomes more efficient it will be the professionals that are left standing. “There are firms hoping to charge five basis points per trade through some sort of intermediary they are calling a prime broker,” said Boonen. “No one is going to pay that. The problem is, you can charge half a basis point on $100 billion a year in volume, but until you get there it will seem like a very long road.”",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2020/05/29/behind-prime-broker-buzzword-lies-a-complex-strategy-game-for-crypto-firms/,coindesk,2020-05-29,17:45:00,en,1533,9473,5.156555772994129,637,0.4155251141552511,coincidence

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, BNB, XLM, XMR, TRX ","Although the Bitcoin ( BTC ) halving generated a lot of interest proceeding the event, it has failed to kickstart a trending move after completion of the event. This suggests in hindsight that the event was priced in.  However, the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap has not given up much ground following the event, which suggests that traders who purchased before halving are confident that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 While Bitcoin has been consolidating in the past few days, the action has shifted to altcoins whose market capitalization has risen from about $77 billion on May 11 to $94 billion at press time.  Investors are now wondering if altcoins can continue their strong run while Bitcoin takes a breather, or will the action again shift back to Bitcoin?  Let’s find out by analyzing the charts to see which major cryptocurrencies could offer trading opportunities in the next few days. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which suggests that the bulls and the bears are digesting the sharp rally from the lows. With three touches on the resistance line of the triangle and two touches on the support line (marked via ellipses on the chart), the formation is complete. BTC-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview If the bulls can propel the BTC/USD pair above the triangle, the next leg of the uptrend is likely to continue. Although the pattern target of this setup is $11,778, the bears are likely to defend the $10,500 levels aggressively. However, if the bulls can push the price above $10,500, it will complete the breakout of a large symmetrical triangle. This move could signal the possible start of a new long-term uptrend.  The bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels or from $10,000 and breaks below the support line of the symmetrical triangle. A break below $8,130.58 could signal the start of a possible downtrend. BTC-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle. They have been mounting a stiff resistance in the $9,800-$10,000 zone.  However, if the pair turns around from the current levels or from $9,400, another attempt to breakout of the triangle is likely. The traders can wait for the price to close (UTC time) above the triangle before buying. The stop-loss for the trade can be kept at $9,400 because if the bears drag the price back into the triangle, it will suggest that the breakout was a bear trap.  If the pair breaks below $9,400, a drop to the support line of the triangle is likely. A strong bounce off this level could also offer a buying opportunity. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has reached the overhead resistance at $18.1377, which is acting as a stiff resistance. However, if the bulls can push the price above the resistance, a rally to $21.7628 is possible.   BNB-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Both moving averages have started to turn up and the relative strength index is in the positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.  Even if the  8th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap turns down from the current levels, it is likely to find support at the trendline. A bounce off the trendline will increase the possibility of a break above $18.1377 as it will suggest that the bulls are buying the dips aggressively. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the trendline. Below this support, a drop to $15.7218 and then to $14 is likely. The bulls are likely to defend $14 aggressively as it has not been broken since April 30.   BNB-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The bulls had pushed the price above the overhead resistance of $18.1377 but they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests that the bears are not willing to give up without a fight. If the bears sink the BNB/USD pair below the 20-simple moving average, the short-term momentum will weaken. On the other hand, if the pair bounces off the current levels, the bulls will make another attempt to scale the price above $18.1377. Traders can buy on a close (UTC time) above $18.1377 with a stop-loss below the 50-SMA. The stops can be trailed higher as the price moves northwards. Another possible buying opportunity will open up after the price rebounds off the trendline support. The stop-loss for this trade can be kept just below the trendline. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) resumed its uptrend after breaking out of the symmetrical triangle on May 30. Both moving averages have started to slope up and the RSI has risen above 60 levels, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand.    XLM-USD daily chart. Source:  Tradingview   The bears might defend $0.076994 aggressively but if the bulls can push the price above this level, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum. The target objective of a breakout of the triangle is $0.0875. As the  12th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap had turned down from close to $0.088 levels on three previous occasions (marked as ellipses on the chart), this level is likely to again act as a major barrier. This bullish view will be invalidated if the altcoin turns down from the current levels and breaks below the support line of the ascending channel. Below the channel, the trend could turn in favor of the bears. XLM-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview   On the 4-hour chart, both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. This suggests that bulls are in command. A breakout of $0.076994 is likely to attract further buying.  Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.076994. The initial stop-loss for the trade can be kept at $0.070. The stops can be trailed higher as the price moves up. However, if the bears can drag the price below the 10-exponential moving average, a drop to the 20-SMA is possible. If this support also gives way, a drop to the support line of the symmetrical triangle is possible.  XMR/USD Monero ( XMR ) has reached the critical overhead resistance of $68.4175. The price had turned down from close to this level twice before, hence, this level is likely to act as a major barrier. XMR-USD daily chart.

Conversely, if the digital asset reverses direction from the current levels, a drop to the moving averages and below it to the trendline is possible. If the bulls buy the dip to the trendline aggressively, it will increase the possibility of a break above $68.4175. However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, a drop to $51-$54 zone is possible. Below this zone, a new downtrend is possible.  XMR-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview Although bulls pushed the XMR/USD pair above $68.4175, they could not sustain the breakout. This suggests that bears are defending the resistance aggressively. However, the pair has held the 20-SMA, which suggests that the bulls are buying the dips. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory indicating that the bulls have the upper hand. Therefore, traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $68.4175 with a stop-loss at $65. The momentum will weaken if the pair breaks and sustains below the 20-SMA. A break below $65 can drag the pair to the trendline. A strong bounce off the trendline can also offer a buying opportunity.  TRX/USD Tron ( TRX ) broke out of the critical overhead resistance of $0.0167242, which is a huge positive because between April 29-May 9 the bulls had repeatedly failed to do so.   TRX-USD daily chart.

A strong bounce off the trendline could lead to one more attempt by the bulls to resume the up move. The trend will turn in favor of the bears on a break below the trendline. If this support gives way, a drop to $0.0128935 is possible.     TRX-USD 4-hour chart. Source:  Tradingview The 4-hour chart shows that the bulls propelled the price above the overhead resistance of $0.0167242 but the bears are not ready to give up without a fight.

If the price sustains below $0.0166, a drop to the moving averages is possible.  Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in command. Therefore, the bulls are likely to buy the dip to the moving averages. Traders might consider buying at $0.0173 or purchasing on a rebound off the moving averages.  A break below the moving averages could result in a drop to the trendline which can also offer another buying opportunity.

binance, News , Poloniex Lists Binance Coin Following Tensions Over Steem ,"Poloniex, a veteran exchange that was recently purchased by a consortium including Tron founder Justin Sun, has launched Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Binance USD (BUSD) pairings. As of June 6, BNB and BUSD wallets are now live on the exchange, with markets for the corresponding pairings slated to  launch  in post-only mode to ensure stability before full trading functionality rolls out. Binance tokens listed on Poloniex The listings bring support for six new pairings, with Binance Coin now tradeable against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Tron ( TRX ) in addition to BUSD, and Binance USD also supported against USDT and BTC. BNB currently comprises the eighth-ranked cryptocurrency by capitalization with $2.76 billion. While BUSD ranks as the 49th-largest crypto asset by market cap, it is the third-ranked stablecoin behind Tether and USD Coin. Are tensions between CZ and Sun subsiding? The listing appears to indicate that it’s business as usual between Binance and Justin Sun, despite the two camps failing to see eye-to-eye over the recent Steem fiasco. After Justin Sun purchased roughly 20% of Steem’s supply alongside Steemit Inc, the cryptocurrency’s community moved to execute a hard fork that would freeze the founder’s reward acquired by Sun. In response, Steem’s block validators were suddenly ousted, with votes corresponding to customer funds stored on Binance, Poloniex, and Huobi being mobilized to remove the delegated proof-of-stake, or  DPoS , network’s witnesses. CZ takes stand against Sun over Steem Following community backlash, Huobi and Binance founder and chief executive Changpeng Zhao, or CZ, asserted that they had been misled as to the nature of what they were voting for, claiming to have been informed of an upcoming “ upgrade .”  While the exchanges promptly  withdrew  their votes, the debacle comprised the catalyst for a community-driven hard fork that would create a new chain dubbed  Hive  — freezing Sun’s controversial founder’s reward in the process. However, retaliatory Steem hard forks initiated to  freeze  millions of STEEM tokens held by the network’s former validators again saw Sun’s action draw public criticism from CZ — who  took aim  at the centralization of Steem and announced that Binance would support additional community-driven forks intended to unfreeze the targeted funds.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/poloniex-lists-binance-coin-following-tensions-over-steem,cointelegraph,2020-06-05,00:00:00,en,366,2340,5.363387978142076,121,0.33060109289617484,poloniex veteran exchange recently purchased consortium including tron founder launched binance coin bnb binance usd busd pairing bnb busd wallet live exchange market pairing slated launch mode ensure stability full trading functionality roll binance token listed poloniex listing bring support pairing binance coin tradeable bitcoin btc tether usdt tron trx addition busd binance usd supported usdt btc bnb comprises ranked cryptocurrency capitalization busd rank largest crypto asset market cap ranked stablecoin tether usd coin tension cz subsiding listing appears business usual binance camp failing eye eye recent steem fiasco purchased roughly steem supply alongside steemit cryptocurrency community moved execute hard fork freeze founder reward acquired response steem validators suddenly ousted vote customer fund stored binance poloniex huobi mobilized remove delegated proof stake dpos network witness cz take stand steem community backlash huobi binance founder chief executive changpeng cz asserted misled nature voting claiming informed upcoming upgrade exchange promptly withdrew vote debacle comprised catalyst community driven hard fork create chain dubbed hive freezing controversial founder reward process retaliatory steem hard fork initiated freeze million steem token network validators action draw public criticism cz aim centralization steem announced binance support additional community driven fork intended unfreeze targeted fund,-0.05924242424242425,negative,0.4227777777777778,"{'neg': 0.087, 'neu': 0.795, 'pos': 0.118, 'compound': 0.7906}",0.7906,0.087,0.795,0.118,positive,-0.2727272479338866,0.05851063798664554,negative
binance,Markets,"Cred Taps Former NSA, Western Union Bosses for Leadership Team","Decentralized lending platform  Cred  has welcomed former National Security Agency computer scientist Bethany De Lude and Western Union executive Daniel Goldstein as chief information security officer (CISO) and chief technology officer (CTO) respectively, the firm announced Monday. Dan Schatt, Cred’s chief executive, told CoinDesk the crypto community stands to benefit a great deal from a financial infrastructure that supports the banking of tokens. That the new executives were willing to come in from the traditional financial sector is indicative of an overall maturing of the blockchain community, and a growing consensus that the technology is here to stay, he claimed.  “You really feel like the tides are turning with people feeling like they don't have to take such a huge career risk to come into this space,” Schatt said.  Prior to joining Cred, De Lude served as the first CISO of the  Federal Judicial Center , the research arm of the U.S. judiciary, and held security leadership roles at the  NSA  and multinational accounting firm  PWC . Most recently, she was the CISO at the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB), a non-profit tasked with supervising auditors for publicly traded companies. In a statement, De Lude said she was eager to bring her knowledge of information security “to help Cred build a world-class security organization” as it continues to grow. “Cred was really built as an infrastructure to bridge the divide between the crypto community and mainstream finance. And that's what we've done. I think that's what's so attractive to people like Bethany, because we're helping to bridge understanding across and on multiple fronts,” Schatt said.  See also:  Crypto Lender Cred Is Offering Investors 10% Interest With Spencer Dinwiddie Partnership According to Schatt, Cred wanted Daniel Goldstein in the role of CTO with specific technical innovations in mind. In Schatt’s view, increasingly, people will be holding their crypto assets in noncustodial wallets.  “That's one area that we're putting a tremendous emphasis on and it's one area that [Goldstein] knows very well having spent a lot of time building microservices and also building his own crypto assets,” Schatt said.  Before joining Cred, Goldstein served as vice president of digital engineering at Western Union. He also held senior management roles at cybersecurity firm  Symantec  and  Emergent Technology Holdings , a company that facilitates global commerce in emerging markets through innovative technologies. According to a press statement by Cred, Goldstein led the development of Emergent Technology’s  Responsible Gold supply chain solution , a blockchain application that tracks gold from mining to vault and its  G-Coin digital token .  “I’m thrilled to support Cred’s mission of providing more equitable and inclusive financial and services utilizing the best of blockchain and traditional fintech,” Goldstein said in the press statement.  Cred is a global financial services platform with customers in 190 countries. Last year, Cred  partnered with a number of crypto exchanges including Binance  in a bid to open up its operations to more markets and users. According to Schatt, Cred’s core philosophy is to create equitable and inclusive financial services surrounding credit. “You can't build a company like that and believe in that unless you believe in doing it internally as well,” Schatt said. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/06/23/cred-taps-former-nsa-western-union-bosses-for-leadership-team/,coindesk,2020-06-23,05:00:00,en,529,3425,5.434782608695652,181,0.34215500945179583,decentralized lending platform cred welcomed national security agency computer scientist de lude western union executive chief information security officer ciso chief technology officer cto firm announced schatt cred chief executive told coindesk crypto community stand benefit great financial infrastructure support banking token executive traditional financial sector indicative maturing blockchain community growing consensus technology stay claimed feel tide turning people feeling huge career risk space schatt joining cred de lude served ciso federal judicial center research arm judiciary security leadership role nsa multinational accounting firm pwc recently ciso public company accounting oversight pcaob profit tasked supervising auditor publicly traded company statement de lude eager bring knowledge information security cred build world class security organization continues cred built infrastructure divide crypto community mainstream finance attractive people helping understanding multiple front schatt crypto lender cred offering investor interest dinwiddie partnership schatt cred wanted role cto specific technical innovation mind schatt view increasingly people holding crypto asset noncustodial wallet area putting tremendous emphasis area spent lot time building microservices building crypto asset schatt joining cred served president digital engineering western union senior management role cybersecurity firm symantec emergent technology holding company facilitates global commerce emerging market innovative technology press statement cred led development emergent technology responsible supply chain solution blockchain application track mining vault coin digital token thrilled support cred mission providing equitable inclusive financial service utilizing blockchain traditional fintech press statement cred global financial service platform customer country cred partnered number crypto exchange including binance bid open operation market user schatt cred philosophy create equitable inclusive financial service surrounding credit build company internally schatt,0.08585858585858586,positive,0.30025252525252527,"{'neg': 0.007, 'neu': 0.763, 'pos': 0.23, 'compound': 0.9955}",0.9955,0.007,0.763,0.23,positive,0.5384614970414233,0.051383399006389725,positive
binance,Tech,Some Numbers That Show Why Yield Farming COMP Is So Seductive,"It's hard to figure out what the new governance token from Compound, COMP, costs. Not its price, but its cost: How much will a user pay to earn freshly minted COMP? This is made especially complicated because the cost isn't what a user deposits or borrows, it is how much net interest they ultimately pay. Insanely, right now, it is possible to earn COMP on extremely risky trades for effectively no cost, as we'll show below. This is not a situation that is likely to end well for many. Compound rewards investors with COMP both for supplying capital and borrowing. To maximize returns, most users do both. They deposit and borrow against that deposit. There are even ways to  spin this into loops  that eke out even more yield (at higher risks). Read more:  Compound Tops MakerDAO, Now Has the Most Value Staked in DeFi This is how Compound has suddenly become the world’s top decentralized finance (DeFi) platform in terms of total value locked (TVL), according to DeFi Pulse. With a small supply and lots of pent-up demand, crypto users are rushing in to earn a return – one that is very strong right now, but not much more likely to last than 2017's initial coin offering boom. Let’s do the numbers To estimate cost, a website called  Predictions Exchange  gives a reasonable idea of how much an investor will spend to earn new COMP, and it helps to show why this asset is so attractive at current prices. The Compound team confirmed to CoinDesk the site's estimates are accurate enough to provide useful guidelines, in a market where factors are changing all the time. COMP currently sits at $222, according to  CoinGecko . The last week has seen wild swings for the new governance token, rising to $338 on June 23 and briefly dipping below $200 on Wednesday. Total value locked (TVL) has been falling in a staggered fashion since June 21, down to about $570 million as of this writing, from a high this weekend of over $600 million. Read more:  A Coinbase Pro Listing and Other Eye-Opening Data Points on Compound’s Surge in Demand Below, we game out three scenarios – from conservative to very risky – using Predictions Exchange, assuming everything stays the same for a year (which is a very bad assumption). All these scenarios will make the assumption of a modest investment of $10,000 in capital, with a COMP price of $200.  The point of this exercise is to give some sense of what investors will pay for each newly minted COMP under different scenarios. It's important to note these numbers change very fast and this post is only meant to explain the current frenzy. The safe-by-crypto-standards way The lowest-yield stablecoin that can be supplied as collateral on Compound is USDC. It earns an APY of only 0.12% as of this writing. The safe move here is to borrow another stablecoin, so let's go with DAI. At a collateralization rate of 75% on Compound, this means the user could borrow 7,500 DAI. Then, there's nothing stopping the user from turning around and depositing that DAI again, increasing their COMP earnings on the supply side. This earns 2.29 COMP at the end of the year, or $458 at the assumed token price of $200. Over that time, the user would pay $107.25 in interest and earn $76.50 on the two deposits, a net loss on the deposits of $30.75. So, the cost per COMP over that time would be $13.43. If the investor sold the COMP right away, it would net $427.25. In fact, if an investor only put the 10,000 USDC in and did nothing else, they would earn 1.06 COMP and $12 in interest, for a net of $224.  By taking on just ever so slightly more risk, the far better move for the conservative investor is to do it with USDT. That would earn 3.21 COMP and $450 in yield on the deposit, for a net of $1,092. The moderately risky way This is crypto so the low-risk, low-return move above was never the one driving the action. Just after COMP began dispensing on June 15, the optimal trade was actually on stablecoins, which meant buyers were fairly protected from swings in the underlying assets. Users were playing with USDC and tether (USDT), two stablecoins. If someone did basically the same trade now (that is, deposit USDC, max out their borrow for USDT and then deposit it again), they’d get more COMP but it also costs more. The trade earns 8.0 COMP in a year. The deposits earn $349.50. The loan costs $866.25, though, for a loss of $516.75. So COMP costs $64.60 in this scenario, and if it were all sold at the end of the year for $1,600, the user would net $1,083.25. However, yield farmers have now shifted away from trading stablecoins. We saw an unprecedented uptick on the stablecoin DEX  Curve  last week but there was a giant  falloff in volume  there Monday, dropping from $110 million on Sunday to around $30 million. The very risky way Since last week, Brave’s basic attention token (BAT) and 0x’s ZRX have spiked in yields on Compound, so they earn much more COMP. Unlike playing with stablecoins, this exposes investors to enormous underlying volatility, and the free money is much too good to last. The supply of BAT on Compound has skyrocketed. One week ago, it was $1.89 million. It has risen to $237.71 million on Thursday (dipping a little since Wednesday). That means 63.5% of BAT’s total market cap is locked into Compound as we speak, according to  CoinMarketCap . Brave, as the creator of BAT and a major holder, has confirmed to CoinDesk it did not move its reserves into Compound in order to earn a return, as some on Crypto Twitter and elsewhere have speculated. Meanwhile, ZRX is the next most expensive token to borrow. Its supply has also spiked on the application, going from $5.63 million a week ago to $41.38 million on Thursday (again with a dip since Wednesday). That means 17.5% of the ZRX market cap is on Compound.  So, if an investor ran the same trade (deposit BAT, borrow ZRX at its 60% collateralization rate and then deposit what's borrowed), the deal looks too good to be true. First, they would earn 33.6 COMP. Note that this is the fastest strategy listed and it's still only 0.65 COMP each week. Then they would also earn $2,538 on the BAT deposit plus $367.20 on their ZRX deposit. Total earnings of $2,905.20, against a borrowing cost of only $978.60. Amazing! That's a profit just on the deposits of $1,926.60. If they sold the COMP earned, that would be $6,720. Total profit: $8,646.60. Cost of COMP? Risk. A lot. ZRX has been as low as $0.13 this year and as high as $0.43. BAT has had similar swings, as low as $0.11 and as high as $0.31. All it takes for these coins is to move against each other for a user's collateral to get slashed by  liquidators  and make the price of running this trade very uncomfortable. Robert Leshner, Compound founder, offered a note of caution  on Twitter , writing: There's already one proposal  to further lower  the amount of augur (REP), BAT and ZRX that can be borrowed per dollar of assets, and the stakeholders in the community have entered into a broader discussion about adding more ways to tame this boom. COMPlexity It's important to note all the estimates above are just that – estimates – and probably not very reliable. This is a brand-new market evolving at the speed of crypto. If nothing else, COMP returns depend heavily on participation levels. In fact, we ran these numbers last night and again this morning, and many of them had already shifted. There's very little doubt that COMP earnings will change a lot over the course of a year.  Compound Labs made a fairly simple formula for distributing COMP tokens, but in a weird way that makes it somewhat complex to estimate what users might expect each day. Each day, the software  distributes 2,880 COMP tokens  to borrowers and lenders on the platform. The amount doesn't change, so obviously the more activity there is the less each participant gets (and vice versa).  This is further complicated by the fact that COMP yield accrues the quickest to markets that have the most demand, and this can change on a dime. As long as there is a large gap between the price of COMP and what it costs to earn it, yield farming will persist, but as there is more liquid COMP, more of it will move onto exchanges. ( Coinbase  promptly listed COMP last week for its Pro traders; Binance followed suit  Thursday .) As the supply grows people will sell.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Watch This Week: BTC, LINK, ATOM, XLM, BNB ","At various points throughout 2020 Bitcoin ( BTC ) was  correlated with gold . During these phases BTC was acting as an  uncorrelated asset , but now it has become  highly correlated to the S&P 500 . This suggests that the  top-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap has been finding acceptance among various groups of traditional investors during different stages of the current coronavirus pandemic induced economic crisis. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Bitcoin’s volatility has dropped in the past few days but select  altcoins  have been rallying sharply, prompting analysts to predict that a new altcoin season has arrived. If Bitcoin shakes out from its slumber and rallies higher, it is likely to be a positive sign and several altcoins may continue to outperform BTC. However, if the volatility expands to the downside, it could result in profit booking in several altcoins. Therefore, traders should keep a close watch on Bitcoin’s price. BTC/USD Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) volatility has dropped sharply as it has been trading inside the $8,900–$9,500 range since June 25. This volatility squeeze is likely to end soon with a sharp breakout in either direction. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can propel the price above $9,500, it is likely to attract buying by traders who have been waiting on the sidelines for a trending move to start. When the price breaks out after a tight consolidation, it is likely to pick up momentum. The bears might attempt to stall the up move at the $10,000–$10,400 zone but the possibility of a breakout is high. A close (UTC time) above the long-term downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle will be a huge positive and it will indicate the likelihood of a new sustained uptrend. Currently, both moving averages are flat and the relative strength index is close to the 50 level, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. As the charts are not indicating an advantage to either the bulls or the bears, it is better to wait for the breakout to happen before jumping in. If the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below $8,900, a drop to $8,130.58 is likely. Although there is a minor support at $8,628, it is unlikely to hold. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the price is stuck close to the middle of the $8,900–$9,500 range. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI is also close to the midpoint, suggesting a state of equilibrium between buyers and sellers. The first sign of strength would be if the bulls can sustain the price above $9,300. Above this level, a retest of $9,500 is likely. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $9,100, a retest of $8,900 is possible. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) broke above the critical overhead resistance of $4.9762 on July 6 and embarked on a strong up move. While a retest of the breakout level usually happens, some times, when the breakout is too strong, the price only consolidates for a few days and then resumes the up move. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView After consolidating for the past three days, the  12th-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap has broken out of $6.5782. If the bulls can close (UTC time) the price above this level, the next leg of the uptrend is likely to resume. The target objective on the upside is $7.6693 and if this level is also crossed, a move to $8.5446 is likely. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, suggesting that bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price fails to sustain above $6.5782. Such a move will indicate profit booking at higher levels and could result in a correction to the 20-day exponential moving average ($5.37). LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls have pushed the price above $6.5782, which suggests strong demand at higher levels. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the overbought territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. On the downside, the first support is at $6.5782 and if that breaks, the buyers are likely to defend the 20-EMA. If the price rebounds off this support, it is likely to resume its up move once again. A break below the 20-EMA will be the first sign of weakness. ATOM/USD Cosmos ( ATOM ) broke above the overhead resistance at $3.20 on July 7. That attracted aggressive buying and the altcoin quickly rallied to $4.466, suggesting the start of a new uptrend. ATOM/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView After the sharp rally of the past few days, the RSI has risen deep into the overbought territory, suggesting that a minor pullback of one to three days is possible. However, as the trend is up, any dip is likely to offer a buying opportunity. The first support on the downside is $3.634 and the next support is $3.377, which are the 38.2% and 50% Fibonacci retracement levels of the most recent rally. In a strong uptrend, usually, the bulls do not allow the price to dip below this support zone. If the  21st-ranked  cryptocurrency on CoinMarketCap bounces off this support zone, the bulls will attempt to resume the uptrend. The target level to watch on the upside is $5.10 and then $5.423. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $3.20. ATOM/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart suggests some profit booking at higher levels. However, the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the 20-EMA during this leg of the up move. Hence, this becomes an important level to watch out for. If the ATOM/USD pair rebounds off the 20-EMA, the bulls will once again attempt to resume the up move. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to the 50-simple moving average is possible. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) has formed a complex inverse head and shoulders pattern, which completed on a break above the neckline at $0.088777. This bullish setup has a target objective of $0.151491 but the bears are likely to mount a stiff resistance at $0.13 and then again at $0.14. XLM/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the failure to pick up momentum following the breakout of the neckline is a mild negative. The  14th-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap has been facing stiff resistance closer to $0.101360, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. If the price again dips back below $0.088777 and breaks below $0.082669, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. Conversely, if the bulls defend the breakout level of $0.088777 and push the price above $0.101360, the momentum is likely to pick up. XLM/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The long wicks on the candlesticks (marked via ellipse on the chart) where the price nears $0.10 level shows aggressive selling by the bears. The bearish divergence on the RSI also points to a possible correction. If the price bounces off the $0.088777 support, the bulls will make another attempt to propel the XLM/USD pair above $0.101360. A close (UTC time) above this level will signal the start of a new uptrend. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below $0.088777. If this support breaks down, it will indicate weakness. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has been range-bound between $18.20–$13.9129 for about three months. Today, the bulls had pushed the price above the resistance of the range but they have not been able to sustain the breakout. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending the resistance of the range. However, if the bulls do not give up much ground, the buyers are likely to make another attempt to scale the price above the range. If they succeed and the  ninth-ranked cryptocurrency  on CoinMarketCap closes (UTC time) above $18.20, it is likely to start a new uptrend that can rally to the next resistance at $21.7628. The 20-day EMA ($16.5) has started to turn up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the moving averages. BNB/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the BNB/USD pair had broken above the overhead resistance at $18.20 but the bulls could not hold on to the higher levels. This suggests that the bears are attempting to defend the resistance of the range. The bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the upward momentum is weakening. However, if the pair bounces off the 20-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to break above the $18.20–$18.59 zone. If they succeed, it will signal strength and will increase the likelihood of the start of a new uptrend. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, it will signal that the breakout was a bull trap.

binance, News , Binance’s Swipe-Powered Crypto Debit Card Debuts in Europe ,"Binance’s highly-anticipated cryptocurrency debit card, Binance Card, is officially debuting in countries of the European Economic Area, or EEA. Binance told Cointelegraph on July 14 that EEA-based users will be able to apply for a Binance Card starting in August. While the United Kingdom will follow in the near future, users in other regions are invited to “register their interest” via the Binance Card website, the firm said. As previously reported, Swipe is currently available in 31 countries within the EEA, including countries like France, Germany, Italy, and Spain, among others. Swipe is not yet available in the United States, but the firm is purportedly planning to release the service soon after completing appropriate licensing and registrations. Four cryptos available at the launch According to the announcement, Binance Card will support a total of four cryptocurrencies at the launch. Those cryptos include Bitcoin ( BTC ), Swipe’s native  SXP  token, as well as Binance’s native token  BNB  and  stablecoin , Binance USD ( BUSD ). According to the announcement, the Binance Card rollout will allow users to instantly convert the cryptos to fiat and spend them at over 60 million merchants across 200 regions and territories.  Binance emphasized that the Binance Card will basically work like a traditional debit card and will not require users to manually convert crypto to fiat before making a purchase. Binance Card users will be able to recharge their card wallet directly from their spot wallet on Binance as well as choose the order of preference to debit their BTC, BNB, SXP and BUSD assets.  Swipe CEO Joselito Lizarondo explained, ""For example, if I have 50 euros in BTC and 50 euros in BNB, if I made a transaction for 75 euros, it would be approved and then it would deduct my crypto in the order I selected.""  The Swipe platform will enable users to store their cryptocurrency on their card wallet and only convert them to fiat currencies when a transaction is taking place. Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao  said that Binance Card will greatly contribute to the adoption of crypto around the world: “By providing a tangible way to transact, convert and spend crypto for everyday use, we are furthering our mission of making crypto more accessible to the masses. Giving users the ability to convert and spend their crypto directly with merchants around the world, will make the crypt experience more seamless and applicable.” Last week, Zhao  demonstrated the first Binance Card transactions , officially confirming that Binance Card will be powered by Swipe. Binance  acquired Swipe  just earlier this month, marking its second acquisition this year.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binances-swipe-powered-crypto-debit-card-debuts-in-europe,cointelegraph,2020-07-14,00:00:00,en,434,2677,5.140552995391705,159,0.3663594470046083,binance highly anticipated cryptocurrency debit binance officially debuting country european economic area eea binance told cointelegraph eea based user apply binance starting united kingdom follow future user region invited interest binance website firm previously reported swipe country eea including country italy swipe united state firm purportedly planning release service completing licensing registration cryptos launch announcement binance support total cryptocurrencies launch cryptos include bitcoin btc swipe native sxp token binance native token bnb stablecoin binance usd busd announcement binance rollout user instantly convert cryptos fiat spend merchant region territory binance emphasized binance basically work traditional debit require user manually convert crypto fiat making purchase binance user recharge wallet directly spot wallet binance choose order preference debit btc bnb sxp busd asset swipe ceo joselito lizarondo explained euro btc euro bnb made transaction euro approved deduct crypto order selected swipe platform enable user store cryptocurrency wallet convert fiat currency transaction taking binance ceo changpeng binance greatly contribute adoption crypto world providing tangible transact convert spend crypto everyday furthering mission making crypto accessible mass giving user ability convert spend crypto directly merchant world make crypt experience seamless applicable demonstrated binance transaction officially confirming binance powered swipe binance acquired swipe earlier marking acquisition,0.05935185185185185,positive,0.40129629629629626,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.9, 'pos': 0.1, 'compound': 0.9601}",0.9601,0.0,0.9,0.1,positive,0.33333322222225925,0.016483516392947713,positive
binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin Gains 17% on Bitcoin in July but Can ‘IEO Season’ Happen? ,"As the price of Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been slowly consolidating over the past few months, altcoins have been taking the spotlight. Recently, massive moves were made by Chainlink ( LINK ), Zilliqa ( ZIL ) and Elrond ( ERD ) and that’s just naming a few of the more popular altcoins. The latter of the three is an IEO (Initial Exchange Offering), meaning, investors’ eyes are automatically focused on Binance Coin ( BNB ), which has outperformed Bitcoin so far this month by roughly 17%. Moreover, if the price of Binance Coin starts to move, typically the IEO tokens typically follow suit.  Crypto market daily performance. Source: TradingView BNB price breaks above the 100 and 200-day moving average As shown on the chart below, this week the BNB/BTC pair is breaking above the 100-day and 200-day moving average. This is a crucial breakthrough, as in previous times it marked the start of a new rally.  BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView As the daily chart shows below, BNB made a double bottom structure, after which a slight rally occurred.  BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView BNB price then tested the old support of 0.0016800 sats and with this level confirmed as support a minor downtrend breakout occurred. This breakout led to a break back into the range of the previous months. This range is defined between support at 0.0018000 sats and resistance at 0.0023000 sats. Reclaiming this previous support at 0.0018000 is essential for further upside momentum.  If that level sustains support, it’s likely to expect a test of the highs again. This is because the price has tested the lows, lost the support, and reclaimed this support. When this occurs it's usually a sign that buyers are stepping into the asset, prompting a retest of the other range levels.  Applying this argument to the daily chart, a renewed test of the 0.0023000 sats resistance level would mean that consolidation above the 100-day and 200-day MA could occur and this would trigger a repeated cycle. However, what crucial steps must BNB take for this to occur?  BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The BNB/BTC pair first needs to break the range resistance for confirmation. The first step would be to claim the 100 and 200-day MAs as support and hold above the 0.0018000 sats level. However, if BNB/BTC wants to start accelerating, it has to break the range resistance at the 0.0022500-0.0024000 sats level. Breaking through that resistance zone would allow a rally toward the peak high to occur. BNB/USDT has to hold the support at $17 BNB/USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The USDT pair of Binance Coin is showing an apparent breakthrough in the $16.50-$17 resistance level. However, to sustain the upward momentum, a support/resistance flip of the same level is needed.  Analyzing the 100 and 200-day MAs reveals some interesting features worthy of further analysis. BNB/USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are currently moving below the price of BNB and this is significant as the same thing occurred at the beginning of 2019. This breakthrough started the cycle from $8 to the peak high at $40, which was also a 500% rally. This doesn’t mean that BNB can make a similar rally as the future can’t be forecasted but nonetheless it is a valuable sign. However, by breaking and flipping the 100 and 200-day MA as support, further upward momentum is warranted. Likewise, the $16.50-$17 level is currently around the moving averages so it is expected that this area will be a crucial factor that determines if the price can move higher. For the time being, BNB/USDT needs to clear the $21-$21.50 area, then there is another barrier at $25.75-$26.25. Will “IEO season” follow? As mentioned earlier, when Binance Coin is moving, the IEO’s usually follow. It’s similar to the correlation between Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) and XRP ( XRP ). If the first one moves, the latter follows.  One Binance IEO which has outperformed the market with a 1,000% rally is Elrond ( ERD ).  ERD/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The ERD/BTC daily chart shows that once the price moved above the 100 and 200-day MAs in May the price of Elrond saw a massive surge. This massive surge led to an increase of 1,485%, which is one of the most substantial moves this year. However, does that mean that now is an excellent opportunity to buy Elrond? No, because it seems unlikely that the price will continue moving forward.  The support levels are significantly lower than the current price (around 90 sats), and there’s a potential bearish divergence coming in to play.  What the chart does show is that there is great potential from IEOs and this could increase as Binance Coin starts to move. CELR/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView There are also other IEOs that are showing similar price action to Elrond but they are lagging heavily. Take, for example, Celer Network ( CELR ). Currently, the altcoin is showing some of the same signals that did Elrond in May.  In June, the CELR/BTC pair broke above the 100 and 200-day MA, which was the first time it has done this since listing in March 2019. Furthermore, CELR is constantly flipping previous resistance levels to support and the trading volume is increasing which is usually a sign of accumulation.  Currently, CELR/BTC has resistance at 0.00000070 and 0.00000100 sats. If the price can break through the 0.00000100 sats level, continuation toward 0.00000250 sats or higher is possible. For the time being, all eyes are on Binance Coin, and if it continues to push higher, the IEOs will most likely follow.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the  author  and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance,Opinion,Amazon Prime Membership Should Have Been a Tokenized Asset,"Jeff Dorman, a CoinDesk columnist, is chief investment officer at Arca where he leads the investment committee and is responsible for portfolio sizing and risk management. He has more than 17 years of trading and asset management experience at firms including Merrill Lynch and Citadel Securities. Decentralized money is important, but tokenized ownership is perhaps an even bigger and more important concept, as it stands today. The idea an ownable asset can be both a utility and an investment at the same time could change the course of investing, and company formation as we know it. And based on recent actions from the government and corporations, we may be closer than ever to achieving this.  A capitalist society means private property rights and the free market serve as the basis of trade, distribution of goods, and development, whereby private ownership and production is operated for profit. But society is now beginning to recognize that ""shareholder capitalism"" is also rife with negative externalities. You need only look at the pressure companies felt (and the greediness and misaligned incentives of management teams) to increase stock prices by spending billions of dollars of idle cash on stock buybacks, only to be left with no rainy day funds during a three-month pandemic.  See also: Jeff Dorman -  What I Learned the First Time I Lost a Million Dollars This, of course, led to trillions of dollars in bailouts at society’s expense; a negative externality that will affect multiple generations for decades.  Joe Biden recently said , “It’s way past time to put an end to the era of shareholder capitalism – the idea that the only responsibility a corporation has is to its shareholders. That’s simply not true and it’s an absolute farce. They have a responsibility to their workers, to their country. That isn’t a new or radical notion.” Independent of political leanings, companies are feeling this pressure more than ever. Not just from Washington, but from society. Is there a way to cater to shareholders while also catering to society and your customers? As usual, we can look at Amazon as an example. More than 150 million people have an Amazon Prime membership, and everyone pays the same price for it. However, a much smaller percentage of people own AMZN shares. You might argue that most AMZN shareholders probably have a Prime membership, but it is certainly not the case that most Prime members own AMZN stock. The Venn diagram might look like this: This chart is illustrative, not based on actual data  When you buy AMZN stock, you know exactly what you are getting – a share of the company’s profits and a “claim on future cash flows.”  However, when you buy a Prime membership, you have no idea what you are getting. At first, purchasing an Amazon Prime membership only gave you faster and cheaper delivery. But over 10-plus years, Prime membership has been rewarded with additional benefits like music, movies and now discounts at Whole Foods.  As a Prime member, you have reaped the benefits of good management and network growth, but it made no difference whether you were the first Prime member or the last to join because you pay exactly the same price as everyone else and receive the same rewards. The same cannot be said for AMZN shareholders, where the price you pay depends on when you purchase. This is the only path where capitalism and socialism can converge, and we’re seeing it happen in real time. Had Prime membership been tokenized, this Venn diagram of ownership would have overlapped much faster. As an early adopter, you would have gained both financially from the increased demand for Prime membership (driving token price higher) and still gained utility as Prime membership benefits were enhanced.  Further, you would have become a strong evangelist for the brand, as you would be financially incentivized to get others to join Prime faster. Both Amazon shareholders and Amazon Prime members have been rewarded, but one could argue both would have done even better had the incentive structure been tweaked through tokenization. As Arca sees it, this is the only path where capitalism and socialism can converge, and we’re seeing it happen in real time. Debt, equity and tokenized digital assets will all have a place in an investor’s portfolio, and more importantly, in customers’ portfolios. The lines are likely to blur as investors become active participants in the bootstrapped growth of the companies they love.  The best example of this to date is Binance and its BNB token. At first, owning the BNB token simply gave you discounts when you used Binance’s services. Today, BNB’s use cases have expanded to: Referral program staking  – If a person holds 500 BNB or more, they receive double the referral bonus, as well as a portion of the trading See also: Jeff Dorman -  If Crypto Is Anything Like Fixed-Income, It’s Going to Need a Fatter Textbook IEO staking –  The number of tickets you can claim depends on the amount of BNB you hold. Discounted Trading fees  – Binance discounts transaction fees by 25% (decreasing to 12.5% in July) whenever a transaction fee is paid for in BNB.  Assist network transactions  using BNB on Binance DEX. Voting power –  The more BNB you own, the more votes you have regarding which coin should list on Binance. Like Amazon, Binance’s business lines and revenues have exploded.  Unlike Amazon, Binance’s customers have  benefited financially , in addition to benefiting from enhanced services. As a result, Binance’s Venn Diagram might look much closer to this: This chart is for illustration purposes; it's not based on actual data  It may sound terrifying to invest in something like a digital asset without knowing exactly what rights you are receiving for your investment. That token designs can change, and features can be added or subtracted, may give you pause as you wonder what your rights are as a token holder.   But when you dissect this, it’s no different than what you do as a shareholder. Those who bought AMZN stock in the early days of the company thought they were investing in an online bookstore. When you back good management teams, it doesn’t really matter what your rights as a shareholder or a token holder are, what matters is that you and management saw the potential before others did. The flexibility of a token’s use cases is just as exhilarating as it is terrifying. The best token designs will, therefore, be those that incentivize customers to take a risk in adopting a new platform before it is clear that it is worth it, and they will be rewarded via increased token prices that will have future value based on how much token holders contribute to the company’s growth. As communities form around these network effects, token holders may be incentivized even further to evangelize on the company’s behalf, thanks to “ownership” rights and a sense of community involvement.  Tokenized ownership may be an effective way to reduce monopolies while still encouraging development and innovation. While companies and politicians fight, the solution may already be here.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/16/amazon-prime-membership-should-have-been-a-tokenized-asset/,coindesk,2020-07-16,16:57:00,en,1185,7102,4.975527426160338,509,0.42953586497890295,coindesk columnist chief investment officer arca lead investment committee responsible portfolio sizing risk management year trading asset management experience firm including citadel security decentralized important tokenized ownership bigger important concept stand today idea ownable asset utility investment time change investing company formation based recent action government corporation closer achieving capitalist society private property right market serve basis trade distribution good development private ownership production operated profit society beginning recognize shareholder capitalism negative externality pressure company felt greediness misaligned incentive management team increase price spending billion dollar idle buyback left rainy fund pandemic learned time lost dollar led trillion dollar bailouts society expense negative externality affect multiple generation decade biden recently past time put end shareholder capitalism idea responsibility corporation shareholder simply absolute farce responsibility worker country radical notion independent political leaning company feeling pressure society cater shareholder catering society customer usual amazon people amazon prime membership pay smaller percentage people amzn share argue amzn shareholder prime membership prime member amzn venn diagram chart illustrative based actual data buy amzn share company profit claim future flow buy prime membership idea purchasing amazon prime membership gave faster cheaper delivery year prime membership rewarded additional benefit movie discount food prime member reaped benefit management network growth made difference prime member join pay receive reward amzn shareholder pay depends purchase path capitalism socialism converge happen time prime membership tokenized venn diagram ownership overlapped faster adopter gained financially increased demand prime membership driving token higher gained utility prime membership benefit enhanced evangelist financially incentivized join prime faster amazon shareholder amazon prime member rewarded argue incentive structure tweaked tokenization arca see path capitalism socialism converge happen time debt equity tokenized digital asset investor portfolio importantly customer portfolio line blur investor active participant bootstrapped growth company binance bnb token owning bnb token simply gave discount binance service today bnb case expanded referral program staking hold bnb receive double referral bonus portion trading crypto fixed income fatter textbook ieo staking number ticket claim depends amount bnb hold discounted trading fee binance discount transaction fee decreasing transaction paid bnb assist network transaction bnb binance dex voting bnb vote coin list binance amazon binance business line revenue exploded unlike amazon binance customer benefited financially addition benefiting enhanced service result binance venn diagram closer chart illustration purpose based actual data sound terrifying invest digital asset knowing right receiving investment token design change feature added subtracted give pause right token dissect shareholder bought amzn day company thought investing online bookstore management team matter right shareholder token matter management potential flexibility token case exhilarating terrifying token design incentivize customer risk adopting platform clear rewarded increased token price future based token holder contribute company growth community form network effect token holder incentivized evangelize company behalf ownership right sense community involvement tokenized ownership effective reduce monopoly encouraging development innovation company politician fight solution,0.044692460317460325,positive,0.41341765873015873,"{'neg': 0.084, 'neu': 0.691, 'pos': 0.225, 'compound': 0.9965}",0.9965,0.084,0.691,0.225,positive,0.3548386982310097,0.07126436765226582,positive

binance, Analysis ," Bitcoin Price Continues Rally, Positive Sentiment Is Off the Charts ","In the past couple of weeks, the Bitcoin ( BTC ) price has resurged after months of apparent monetary stagnation. Since July 23, the value of a single Bitcoin has  risen  by around 20%. Not only that, after trading sideways since its supply squeeze in early May, the premier currency broke through its all-important $10,000 psychological threshold, thus leading many casual investors to once again jump back on the crypto hype train. Bitcoin’s recent price hike has also resulted in a retail boom, with a whole host of trading platforms across the world  reporting  sky-high Bitcoin trading volumes. As a result of this bullish market activity, Joe DiPasquale, prominent crypto pundit and CEO of BitBull Capital, recently stated that this latest surge is once again building up an element of FOMO, or fear of missing out, among casual investors who believe they might be late to the crypto party. Echoing a somewhat similar sentiment, Joshua Frank, co-founder and CEO of The Tie — a provider of data aggregation tools — commented to Cointelegraph that historically speaking, volatility has driven significant new waves of interest and investors into Bitcoin, particularly with the most recent run from $9,000 to $12,000. Frank outlined that the 30-day average number of Twitter users discussing Bitcoin has spiked from 24,000 to 30,000 over the last two weeks, adding: “Bitcoin hit its highest daily tweet volume level since June 26th 2019 in the wake of the Twitter scam on July 16th. While it isn’t clear that the run-up had any correlation to the scam, we have seen in the past that, all else equal, the more users talking about Bitcoin the better the asset performs.” Denis Vinokourov, head of research at BeQuant, a crypto exchange and institutional brokerage service, told Cointelegraph that since volatility picked up, his firm has observed trade volumes jumping by about 40% from where daily summer averages were prior to this recent rally. Top cryptocurrencies are mobilizing fast Cointelegraph also discussed the recent market action with Adam Vettese, market analyst at cryptocurrency trading and investment platform eToro. He pointed out that since crypto prices began rallying at the end of July, the number of crypto positions being opened increased by 115% versus the previous fortnight. Over the same time period, trading volume in crypto instruments also increased by 162%. The number of Bitcoin positions opened increased by 222% with a 421% rise for Ether ( ETH ) and 170% for  XRP . Christophe Michot, sales director at digital asset trading platform CrossTower also claimed that over the course of the past couple of weeks, his firm has observed a 219% increase in daily trading volume as well as a 66% rise in the number of daily average signups over the same time period. Michot also highlighted that since the pullback in mid-March, the market as a whole has experienced a strong bullish reversal. For example, Bitcoin has regained over 210% and Ethereum bounced by 364% since the “Black Thursday” crash of March 11, 2020.  The crypto market rally has come on the heels of positive news such as the U.S. OCC’s recent clarification  permitting the custody of Bitcoin by banks  as well as the announcement of another  stimulus package to be issued by the Fed  in the near future, which some experts believe will continue to devalue the U.S. dollar. People’s sentiment regarding crypto is soaring On July 12, Bitcoin’s long-term sentiment score — a comparison of investor sentiment over the last 50 days vs. the prior 200 — hit a new all-time high leading up to Bitcoin’s run at the end of the month. Similarly, the daily sentiment score represents a measure of how positive or negative conversations on Twitter have been about a particular coin over the last 24 hours vs. the previous 20 days.  The daily sentiment score of investors has remained positive (above 50) every day from July 20 to Aug. 1. Even after Bitcoin  failed to surpass the $12,000 mark and retraced by $1,400 , investor sentiment fell below 50 for only about 28 hours, alluding to the fact that investors have remained extremely positive on Bitcoin. Frank told Cointelegraph that approximately 68% of all tweets discussing the long-term financial future of Bitcoin over the past month have been positive. Similarly, Michot added that according to CrossTower’s media data, the market is in the early stages of a new bull run, adding: “Another positive sentiment is coming from family offices and other traditional advisory firms. These firms are seeing increased demands by clients seeking exposure to the cryptocurrency markets.” Other crypto-related offerings are also flying high Since the start of the recent crypto surge, there has been a spike in the use of stablecoins along with a clear increase in demand for other DeFi-related tokens. John Todaro, director of institutional research at TradeBlock, a trading platform for institutional investors, told Cointelegraph: “Stablecoin circulating supplies have increased substantially over the past 6 months, with Tether seeing around $10bn in deposits and USDC seeing over $1bn. This may seem small, but those deposits make Circle and Tether, to an extent, defacto banks with sizable customer deposits. $5–10 bn in customer deposits is equivalent to a small to midsize U.S. commercial bank.” Todaro added that while merchant adoption still remains limited for stablecoins, there is real demand for these assets in developing economies as well as those with political instability, such as in Latin America, parts of the Middle East, and to an extent, Hong Kong. He also noted that derivatives volumes have spiked recently (at Deribit, CME and others), but a large portion of that is tied to price action, as increased volatility almost always tends to drive increased trade volumes.  Vinokourov believes that the recent spell of low volatility and thin trading volumes has evolved into one of the busiest periods for digital assets in recent memory: “Volumes on spot and derivatives venues spiked higher as Bitcoin traded over $11,000, and other large cap assets followed in lockstep.” Vinokourov further opined:  “Particular attention ought to be paid to the evolution of Ethereum volatility profile which, despite coming off recent highs, remains elevated relative to Bitcoin. This suggests more potential volatility for the second largest cryptocurrency.” BTC Fear and Greed Index’s correlation with its price  Another aspect worth exploring is the relationship that may or may not exist between Bitcoin’s Fear and Greed Index and its price, and if the metric can suggest a possible price direction. Expounding his views on the matter, Todaro opined that the index is calculated based on a few variables that are, to an extent, affected by price, forcing the index to follow certain niche inputs such as the velocity of price gains, all-time high prices and price momentum, among other parameters. For instance, if there is a large crash in the market, volatility will increase, and the index will conclude that the market has high fear. In doing so, the index ultimately follows the price. Additionally, the index captures Google trends, with high interest in positive crypto-related terms meaning high greed. Therefore, Todaro believes that the index can be used to make current and future investment decisions: ""While the price of Bitcoin isn’t back to all-time highs, this was the fastest price gain over a 10-day period in its history, which would read extremely greedy, and so maybe it is time to sell and wait for a pullback to re-enter.” Another correlation worth exploring is the one between Bitcoin and the S&P 500. According to Quantum Economics founder Mati Greenspan, the previously high  correlation between crypto-assets and the S&P 500 has now decreased : “We can clearly see earlier this year, where the correlation spiked up to 0.6 due to the multi-asset early-pandemic sell-off. By now, however, we’re once again below 0.2, which basically means that there is no correlation on a day-to-day basis anymore.” Furthermore, Greenspan noted that even a peak of 0.6 only represents a very loose correlation, adding, “Many stocks have a very high correlation with each other, usually above 0.8 even if they’re in completely different industries, and many altcoins are similar.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-price-continues-rally-positive-sentiment-is-off-the-charts,cointelegraph,2020-08-07,00:00:00,en,1352,8336,5.154585798816568,511,0.3779585798816568,past

binance, News , Crypto Travel Agency Travala to Use Binance Chain for Decentralized Services ,"Cryptocurrency travel agency Travala.com announced that it started a collaboration with Binance Chain aiming to decentralize its services. Travala.com intends to roll out decentralized reviews, decentralized accommodation bookings, a decentralized referral system and a decentralized salesforce. The firm’s CEO Juan Otero explained that — in the future — users will be dealing directly with the property owners, leveraging blockchain’s disintermediation potential: “Under this decentralized model, accommodation seekers will be able to book stays without the need for an intermediary. Said another way, individuals seeking to rent an apartment, bedroom, or hotel room will be able to deal directly with property owners.” Otero explained that Travala.com will only provide the technology needed to facilitate bookings, including tools for user reputation, dispute mediation and governance mechanisms. Travel service providers will be able to control all the aspects of their online listings and deal directly with their customers. After Travala.com launches the decentralized accommodation booking system, the firm plans to focus its efforts on developing a decentralized review service. Reviews will be stored on-chain to ensure that they cannot be removed or edited after they have been submitted.  Otero also explained that — in order to prevent fake reviews — Travala.com intends to use tokenized incentives and only allow reviews from users that have visited a given location by booking on the platform.  So far, Otero does not have a clear idea of how much of Travala.com’s business he can move on chain. He explained that “in the long-run, ideally all aspects of the [decentralized online travel agency] will be on-chain” but admitted that this may not be practical: “Realistically we will have to phase out what aspects of the [firm] are on-chain. As we are closer to the implementation of certain features we will review the trade-offs of being on-chain versus off-chain.” This is the latest in a long series of announcements by Travala.com which apparently is currently pursuing an aggressive expansion of its business.  Earlier this month,  Travala.com added over 600.000 hotels  through a partnership with booking giant Agoda. In July,  Expedia also partnered with the firm , adding over 700,000 accommodations to the platform, which resulted in a  68% increase in bookings .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/crypto-travel-agency-travala-to-use-binance-chain-for-decentralized-services,cointelegraph,2020-08-21,00:00:00,en,363,2386,5.556473829201102,152,0.418732782369146,cryptocurrency travel agency travala announced started collaboration binance chain aiming decentralize service travala intends decentralized review decentralized accommodation booking decentralized referral system decentralized salesforce firm ceo explained future user dealing directly property owner leveraging blockchain disintermediation potential decentralized model accommodation seeker stay intermediary individual seeking rent apartment bedroom hotel room directly property owner explained travala provide technology needed facilitate booking including tool user reputation dispute mediation governance mechanism travel service provider control aspect online listing directly customer travala launch decentralized accommodation booking system firm plan focus effort developing decentralized review service review stored chain ensure removed edited submitted explained order prevent fake review travala intends tokenized incentive review user visited location booking platform clear idea travala business move chain explained run ideally aspect decentralized online travel agency chain admitted practical realistically phase aspect firm chain closer implementation feature review trade offs chain versus chain latest series announcement travala apparently pursuing aggressive expansion business earlier travala added hotel partnership booking giant agoda expedia partnered firm adding accommodation platform resulted increase booking,0.03235294117647059,positive,0.5563725490196079,"{'neg': 0.041, 'neu': 0.876, 'pos': 0.084, 'compound': 0.7096}",0.7096,0.041,0.876,0.084,positive,0.0,0.02484472034257938,neutral
binance, Price Analysis , Swipe (SXP) bounces after 54% crash — Is $7 now a realistic target? ,"Swipe's Swipe Token ( SXP ), the 68th digital asset by market capitalization, has been one of the most volatile cryptocurrencies of the previous weeks.  Fueled by a  new cryptocurrency card and partnership with Binance , SXP price soared from $1.50 to $5 in a matter of days in mid-August. However, the price of Swipe dropped more than 50% to $2.30 over the past week. Crypto market daily performance snapshot. Source:  Coin360 Swipe Token retraced with 54% to bottom out at $2.30 SXP/USDT 12-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 12-hour chart of Swipe Token is showing a full retrace of the previous rally. As the chart is also showing clear support and resistance levels, the first primary support level was found between $2.20 and $2.40. Swipe Token retraced to this level to find support, bouncing by 35% since. However, a clear breakout and new rally toward the all-time high seems unlikely in the short term. Instead, a substantial consolidation period before could occur.  The left side of the chart is showing a similar consolidation period before continuation, as assets prices don’t go up in one go. Frequently, levels are tested for support and resistance before the price of a specific asset starts to rally, and Swipe Token is no different.  The chart doesn’t have much historical price data, Fibonacci helps SXP/USDT 12-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The Fibonacci extension tool can be used for further price projections in price discovery, as the chart doesn’t show much historical price data. For Swipe Token to rise further, it must break out above the current resistance level, which is found between $3.10 and $3.20. However, once Swipe Token breaks out of this range, a new impulse wave is likely given the current market momentum and  sentiment surrounding the project .  The Fibonacci extension tool can be used with the recent low and high to set new price targets. The first massive level is at $6.60 to $6.70, and the second level (at 2.618 Fibonacci level) is found at $9.40.  The potential scenario for Swipe Token SXP/BTC 12-hour chart. Source:  TradingView As Swipe Token faces a significant resistance zone, it is likely that the asset sees some more consolidation before continuation.  The central support zone is found in the green area, which relies on the previous high. As long as the green zone between 0.00020000–0.00022000 sats sustains support, further upward momentum can be expected. The crucial resistance zone to break through is the red area, a significant resistance block between 0.00026000–0.00028000 sats. Once the price of Swipe Token breaks through this level, the next resistance zone can be found at 0.00032000–0.00034000 sats. If Swipe Token does well, Binance Coin will likely follow BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView Binance Coin ( BNB ) is one of the major cryptocurrencies that has been lagging in recent weeks unlike Ether ( ETH ), Chainlink's LINK and others. However, the price of Binance Coin is stuck between the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs), as the chart shows.  A breakout above the 200-day MA would create space toward the range high at 0.0023000 sats. One bullish sign is the support/resistance flip of the green zone, which became support again. In other words, more upside can be expected for BNB as long as the 0.0018000 sats holds as support. The general rule of thumb is when Binance Coin does well, the IEOs — Initial Exchange Offering tokens that were launched on Binance — also perform well. In that regard, these coins, including Swipe Token, may be worth keeping an eye on for traders in the near term.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the  author  and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, BNB, NEO, YFI, LINK ","This week Digital Assets Data CEO Mike Alfred told Cointelegraph that mainstream investors are still “skeptical of Bitcoin and the ecosystem.""  However, Alfred believes that this “skepticism and disbelief” will turn out to be a positive for Bitcoin ( BTC ) because when the “traditional folks capitulate, they will be forced by their clients and partners to get involved at significantly higher prices."" While Bitcoin has struggled to start a sustained uptrend in the past few weeks, select altcoins and tokens in the DeFi space have been in a strong bull run. This shows that traders attention has shifted away from Bitcoin. Crypto market data daily view. Source:  Coin360 Pantera Capital founder and CEO  Dan Morehead believes that the DeFi space will outrun Bitcoin in the next five years  and grow by about 100x.  In the long-term, most analysts are uber bullish on the crypto space but what can traders expect in the next few days?  Let’s have a look at the cryptocurrencies that could offer short-term trading opportunities and spot the critical levels on each of them. BTC/USD Bitcoin completed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern on July 27 when it closed above $10,500 and usually the price retests the breakout levels of such reversal patterns.   BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView In ideal conditions, the price should not dip below the neckline of the inverse H&S pattern, but trading is anything but ideal. Although the bears pulled the BTC/USD pair below the neckline on Sep. 3, there has not been much follow up selling, which suggests buying by the bulls at lower levels. However, this buying dries up when the price tries to move up above the $10,500 level. Due to this, the pair is currently stuck in the $9,835–$10,625 range. After the bears failed to sink the price below the range on Sep. 8, the bulls today attempted to push the price above the overhead resistance but failed. The 20-day exponential moving average ($10,719) is just above the resistance of the range, hence, the bears are likely to defend it aggressively.  However, if the bulls can propel the pair above the 20-day EMA and sustain the higher levels for three days, it will suggest that the correction is over. That could result in a retest of $12,460 and if this resistance is crossed, the uptrend is likely to resume. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks and sustains below the $9,835 support.  BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $10,625 resistance but if they fail to sink the price below the $10,200 support, the bulls will once again try to clear the overhead resistance of the range. If they succeed, aggressive traders are likely to jump in, which could result in a quick move to $11,400 and possibly $12,000. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the $10,200 support, a drop to $10,000 and then to $9,835 is possible.  BNB/USD While most major cryptocurrencies are searching for a bottom, Binance Coin ( BNB ) has resumed its uptrend and made a new 52-week high, which is a sign of strength. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Although the relative strength index was showing the formation of a bearish divergence, the sharp move on Sep. 12 invalidated this bearish setup. Currently, the BNB/USD pair is facing stiff resistance at the $32 level but if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the critical support at $27.1905, a retest of $32 is likely. A break above this resistance could push the price to $38. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears pull the pair down below $27.1905 it will indicate that the current move might have been a bull trap. BNB/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are aggressively defending the $32 level as seen from the long bearish candle on the 4-hour chart. However, the positive sign is that the bulls are not panicking and they continue to purchase the dip. They will now again try to push the price above the $32 resistance. If they succeed, the momentum is likely to pick up but if the price again turns down from $32, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. NEO/USD The failure of the bears to sink and sustain  NEO  below the breakout level of $16.72441 attracted buying by the bulls who pushed the price to $21.97869 today. NEO/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are defending the $22–$22.82612 resistance zone aggressively but if the NEO/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($18.54), the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the resistance zone. If they succeed, the next leg of the up-move is likely to begin. There is a minor resistance at $25.23 above which the momentum is likely to pick up. However, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair might drop to $16.72441. A breakdown and close below this support will be a huge negative.  NEO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The failure to break above the $22 level could have attracted profit booking by the short-term bulls. This has pulled the price below the 20-EMA. However, if the bulls can keep the price above $19.27244, (50% Fibonacci retracement level), then another attempt to clear the overhead resistance is likely. A break below the $19.27244–$18.63376 support could weaken the momentum and result in a drop to $16.72441. YFI/USD The correction in Yearn.finance ( YFI ) that started on Aug. 31 found support close to $21,345, which was the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the entire run-up from $3,000–$39,690.  YFI/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Repeated attempts by the bears to break below the $21,345 support failed and the range shrunk between Sep. 5 and Sep. 8, which suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears. This uncertainty resolved to the upside with a sharp up-move on Sep. 9, which indicated that the bulls had reasserted their dominance. The target objective of this next leg of the uptrend is $46,632.46 and then the psychological resistance at $50,000. However, the bears are attempting to stall the rally at $43,966.31. If they can sink the YFI/USD pair below the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the most recent leg of the rally at $31,011.37, the momentum is likely to weaken.  The developing bearish divergence on the RSI warrants caution but if the pair rebounds from the $34,068.74–$31,011.37 support zone, the bulls will make another attempt to resume the uptrend.  YFI/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bears have pulled down the pair below the 20-EMA, which suggests that the short-term momentum has weakened. The next support on the downside is $31,011.37. If the pair rebounds sharply from $31,011.37, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $43,966.31. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has thrice turned down from the $13.28 levels since Sep. 6 but the positive sign is that the bears have not been able to sink the price below the trendline, which shows buying at lower levels. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the LINK/USD pair again rebounds off the trendline, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $13.28. If they succeed, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to the downtrend line. This level is again likely to act as a resistance but if the bulls can push through it the pair could rally to $17.7777. However, if the bears sink the price below the trendline, it will suggest weakness, which could result in a drop to $8.908. Such a move will be a huge negative and it will hurt sentiment. LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $13.28 levels but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the $11 level.  If the pair rebounds off the current levels or from the trendline, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above the $13.28 resistance. If they succeed, momentum is likely to pick up and a quick move to $15 is likely. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink and sustain the price below the trendline.

binance, Price Analysis , Can Binance Coin hit $40? BNB faces last hurdle before all-time highs ,"In recent weeks, most of the cryptocurrency market has been doing poorly except for a few select altcoins. One of them is Yearn.finance ( YFI ), which was discussed in an earlier article. The other large-cap cryptocurrency doing well is Binance Coin ( BNB ), as the token of the cryptocurrency exchange dropped to $18 and immediately ran to $32 within one week.  This is a rally of 80% in a matter of days and, therefore, ripe for technical analysis to gauge where BNB may be headed next.  Crypto market daily performance. Source:  Coin360 Binance Coin faces final resistance before test of all-time highs  BNB/USDT 3-day chart. Source:  TradingView The 3-day chart of Binance Coin is showing a massive surge in the past week and some beautiful technical analysis. Due to the dropdown of Bitcoin ( BTC ), the price of Binance Coin dropped severely, as the level at $18 saw a test of this support. This level at $18 continued to hold support, after which a massive jump occurred. This push upward was partially caused by the  announcement  that Binance is entering the DeFi space as well as the CEO of Binance  urging  Ethereum-based projects to join the new Binance Smart Chain platform. As a whole, the bounce from $18 towards $25 caused the price to break through the $25 resistance level.  The chart shows that the next resistance zone is found between $32-35 and that’s the area that’s currently being tested by the fifth-ranked cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  If the price of Binance Coin breaks above this red area, a test of the all-time high levels seems very likely. However, it’s the first time that the cryptocurrency would test this red area, which means that a breakout in one-go is less likely as sellers should step in. BNB/BTC breaks above 100-day and 200-day MAs BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The BTC pair of Binance Coin shows a precise construction that was broken to the upside.  A similar scenario was seen around December 2018 with a breakout above the 100-day and 200-day moving averages (MAs) caused the price to rally substantially. In recent weeks, a similar scenario occurred as the MAs lined up nicely together and were flipped from resistance to support. Additionally, the crucial resistance zone at 0.00022500 sats finally broke, which led to another chain reaction and continuation of the price to surge higher.  BNB/BTC 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView The price of Binance Coin has been hovering against the 0.00022500 sats range for more than twelve months, as several tests failed to break through the resistance zone.  The recent test led to a strong breakout, resulting in the start of a new impulse move — a very similar price move as the one at the beginning of 2019. Can Binance Coin rally towards $35? BNB/USDT 2-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 2-hour chart of Binance Coin is showing a clear structure. The crucial support area at $28 was held as support, after which a new higher high was printed.  However, the previous resistance zone at $31 should continue to sustain support. If that occurs, a potential target of $35 is on the tables. If the structure in itself continues to paint an upward trend, a possible test of the all-time high is also likely. But if the price of Binance Coin drops below $31, traders should expect a test of potential support zones at $28 and $26.  The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the  author  and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/16: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BNB, LINK, DOT, ADA, LTC, BSV     ","Chicago Mercantile Exchange’s cash-settled Bitcoin ( BTC ) futures trading products “contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” according to findings in a  new report by investment firm Wilshire Phoenix . The increasing volumes of crypto derivative products highlight  greater participation  from institutional investors and this will likely be positive for the entire crypto space. This is not unique to cryptocurrencies because even in most other asset classes, the derivatives markets lead the spot markets. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 In a separate attempt to determine the valuation of Bitcoin, several experts from JPMorgan Chase opined that Bitcoin’s price is  overvalued compared to its intrinsic value  and the analysts suggested that BTC could face selling in the short-term. The analysts consider Bitcoin to be a commodity and have calculated its marginal cost of production to estimate its intrinsic value. While fundamentals do work in the long-term, short-term price action is usually dictated by sentiment and technicals. Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to determine the path of least resistance. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) bounced off the $11,178 support on Oct. 15 but the bulls could not sustain the price above $11,500. This weakness could have attracted profit booking by the short-term traders and shorting by the aggressive bears. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are currently attempting to sink the price back below the critical support at $11,178. However, this level is likely to attract buyers because the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,081) is placed just below this support. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index in the positive territory suggest that buyers have the upper hand. If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it will be the first sign of strength. The uptrend could pick up momentum after the bulls can sustain the BTC/USD pair above the ascending channel. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the support line of the channel is possible. A breakdown of the channel could spark further selling, which could result in a drop to $10,000. ETH/USD The bears are currently attempting to sustain Ether ( ETH ) below the moving averages. If they succeed, a drop to the uptrend line is possible. If this support also cracks, it will indicate a range-bound action for the biggest altcoin for a few more days. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The flat moving averages and the RSI near 50 also point to a balance between supply and demand. However, if the ETH/USD pair turns up from the current levels or the uptrend line, the bulls will again try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $395. If they can pull it off, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $481.608. XRP/USD XRP  broke below the moving averages on Oct. 15 and is on its way to the critical support at $0.2295. Although the altcoin had formed a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern, the bulls could not push the price above the neckline at $0.26 and the setup did not complete. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The current price action of the altcoin is a good example of why traders should wait for the setup to complete before taking a directional bet. Buying in anticipation could quickly turn the trade into a loss. The XRP/USD pair is currently range-bound between $0.2295 and $0.26, hence, the bulls are likely to buy near the support of the range. A trending move will start after the bulls push the price above $0.26 or the bears sink the pair below $0.219712. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) witnessed sharp selling at $266.46 that resulted in a retest of the breakout level at $242. The sharp rebound off this support suggests that the bulls aggressively accumulated at lower levels and $242 has now flipped from resistance to support. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($238) and the RSI above 60 suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the buyers can push the price above $266.46, the uptrend could reach $280 and then $300. This assumption will be invalidated if the bears sell at the current levels and sink the BCH/USD pair below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could again drop to $215. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has turned around from $31.9798 today as the bears attempt to stall the uptrend and sink the price back below the support at $29.5646 and the 20-day EMA at $28.77. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the sellers can manage to sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened. A break below $26 could suggest the start of a deeper correction to $22. However, if the BNB/USD pair rises from the $22.5646 support or the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend. A strong rebound will suggest that the bulls are aggressively accumulating on dips, while a weak rebound will indicate a lack of demand, hence, the bears could pounce on it. Therefore, traders can keep an eye on the strength of the rebound to determine whether the up-move will resume or the rally will fizzle out at higher levels. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) turned down from the 50-day simple moving average ($11.22) on Oct. 13 but the positive thing is that the bulls are attempting to arrest the pullback at the 20-day EMA ($10.40). LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A strong rebound off the 20-day EMA will be the first sign that the sentiment has turned from sell on rallies to buy on dips. The first target is $12 and above this, the LINK/USD pair could reach $13.28. However, if the rebound off the 20-day EMA is weak, it may again face stiff resistance at the 50-day SMA. If the pair once again turns down from this overhead resistance, it will increase the possibility of a decline to $8.7975. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) has turned down from the 20-day EMA ($4.22) and the bears will now try to sink the price below the $3.5321 support. If the bears manage a close (UTC time) below $3.5321, it will complete a descending triangle pattern. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This bearish setup has a target objective of $1.4743. However, it may not be a straight fall to this level because the bulls could step in and provide support at $2.60 and again at $2. Contrary to this assumption, if the DOT/USD pair turns up from the current levels or rebounds off $3.5321, the bulls will try to push the price above the resistance line of the descending triangle. If that happens, it will invalidate the bearish pattern and that could result in an up-move to $4.6112 and then $5.5899. ADA/USD  The bulls could not drive Cardano ( ADA ) above the neckline of the possible inverse head and shoulders pattern. This could have attracted profit booking by the short-term bulls and selling by the aggressive bears resulting in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($0.10). ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView As the 20-day EMA is sloping up marginally and the RSI is in the positive zone, the bulls may defend this support. If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to push the price above the neckline. If they succeed, the pair could start a new uptrend that may reach $0.128062 and above it $0.1445. This positive view will be invalidated if the pair continues to slip and it breaks below the 50-day SMA ($0.098). Such a move could result in a drop to $0.090. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has dropped below both moving averages today, which suggests that the bears used the rally to the $51 resistance to initiate short positions. However, the bulls have not yet given up as they are currently attempting to defend the uptrend line. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls fail to push the price above the moving averages, the selling is likely to intensify and the bears will once more try to sink the LTC/USD pair below the uptrend line. If they succeed, a drop to $42 is possible. Conversely, if the pair rises above the moving averages, the bulls will try to thrust the price above the $51–$52.36 resistance zone. If they succeed, the inverse head and shoulders pattern will complete and it has a target objective of $60.3702. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) has broken below the moving averages and is now likely to remain range-bound between $180.63 and $146.20. The fall today has invalidated the possibility of an inverse head and shoulders pattern. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA ($166) is flat but the 50-day SMA ($167) is sloping down and RSI has dropped below 42, which suggests a slight advantage to the bears. A break below $146.20 could start a new downtrend. However, if the BSV/USD pair recovers from the current levels or from the $146.20 support, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $180.63. A close (UTC time) above this resistance could start an up-move to $210.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, XLM, CRO, BNB, LTC    ","Data from Skew shows Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) spot volume on LMAX Digital, an exchange that mainly caters to institutions, has overtaken retail-oriented exchanges. This signals that institutional investors could be building up positions as they expect the price to move higher in the future. Along with spot purchases, institutional investors’ participation in the derivatives market has also increased. Data from Arcane Research shows that a record number of investors are taking  delivery of Bitcoin  from the Bakkt Bitcoin exchange. Another metric that can be useful for traders is volatility. Bitcoin options data shows that the  implied volatility  of at the money options has dropped to a 16-month low. This suggests that traders do not expect a large down move in the near future, hence, they are not willing to pay a greater amount to hedge their positions. Although data suggests that institutional investors are positioned for an upside move, retail traders should keep a close watch on the price action and take large bets only after a trending move starts. Let’s study the charts of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could start a trending move next week. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has been holding above the 20-day exponential moving average ($11,137) for the past few days. The buyers purchased the dip to the $11,165 support on Oct. 20, which suggests accumulation at lower levels. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the BTC/USD pair could retest the $11,719 resistance. A breakout of this level may resume the up-move with the first target at $12,000 and then $12,460. Both the short-term and the long-term moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index is above 61. This suggests that the bulls are in control. This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could pull the price down to the next support at $10,500. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart has formed a bearish descending triangle pattern that will complete on a breakdown and close (UTC time) below $11,165. This bearish setup has a pattern target of $10,611. However, if the bulls can propel the price above the downtrend line, the bearish pattern will be invalidated. Such a move could attract short covering by the bears, resulting in a rally to $12,000. The gradually upsloping 20-EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. XLM/USD Stellar Lumens ( XLM ) broke below the 200-day simple moving average ($0.077) on Sep. 21 but the bears could not capitalize on this move and sink the price below $0.066841. This shows buying by the bulls at lower levels. XLM/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The XLM/USD pair has formed an ascending channel and the bulls are attempting to push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.084584. Although the bears defended the overhead resistance on Oct. 17, the bulls have not given up much ground. If the pair stays above the moving averages, the buyers will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.084584. If they succeed, the pair could start a new uptrend that may rally to $0.10. The gradually upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls have the upper hand. XLM/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The pair had broken above the channel but the bulls could not clear the hurdle at $0.084584. However, on the downside, the bears have not been able to drag the price below the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.079239. This suggests that the bulls will again try to thrust the price above the overhead resistance. If they succeed, a rally to $0.091042 will be on the cards. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the 20-EMA, a drop to $0.076546 is possible. A break below this level could result in a decline to the support line of the channel. CRO/USD The descending triangle completed on Oct. 14 when Crypto.com Coin ( CRO ) plummeted and closed (UTC time) below the $0.144743 support. This bearish setup has a target objective of $0.10607. CRO/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bulls might attempt to defend the 200-day SMA at $0.121. A bounce off this level could retest the breakdown level at $0.144743. In a downtrend, traders sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA ($0.144) as the path of least resistance is to the downside. Hence, if the CRO/USD pair turns down from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the sentiment is bearish. The sellers will then again try to sink the price below the 200-day SMA. If they succeed, the decline could extend to $0.10607. The 20-day EMA is sloping down and the RSI has plummeted deep into the oversold territory, which suggests that the advantage is with the bears. However, a relief rally cannot be ruled out in the short-term. CRO/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The RSI on the 4-hour chart has also plunged deep into the oversold territory. This suggests panic selling and usually, after such a round of such intense selling, a minor pullback occurs. Any relief rally is likely to face selling at the 20-EMA as bears will try to consolidate their advantage. This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair rises and sustains above the breakdown level of $0.144743. Until then, every rally is likely to be viewed as a selling opportunity. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) turned down from $31.9798 on Oct. 16 but the bulls purchased the dip to the immediate support at $29.5646. This suggests that the previous resistance level has now flipped to support. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($29.06) and the RSI above 61 indicates that bulls have the upper hand. The 200-day SMA ($19.95) has also started to turn up, which suggests that the long-term trend is also tilting in favor of the bulls. If the buyers can thrust the BNB/USD pair above the $32– $33.3888 resistance zone, the momentum could pick up and a retest of the all-time highs will be on the cards. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink and sustain the pair below the 20-day EMA, it will signal weakness. BNB/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are defending the $31–$32 zone aggressively. The flattened 20-EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand. This balance will tilt in favor of the bears if they can sink and sustain the price below $29.5646. If this support cracks, a drop to $28 and then to $26 is possible. Conversely, if the bulls propel the price above the overhead resistance zone, it will signal the resumption of the uptrend. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) is attempting to form an inverse head and shoulders pattern that will complete on a breakout and close (UTC time) above $51.50. The flat moving averages and the RSI below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the long tails on the candlesticks on Oct. 2 and Oct.16 show that the bulls are buying the dips to the trendline. If the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the LTC/USD pair could again rise to $51.50. A breakout and close (UTC time) above this level could start a new uptrend. The pattern target of the reversal setup is $61.50. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the trendline. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound for a few more days. LTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the rebound off the trendline is struggling to sustain above $47.7845. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. The 20-EMA is sloping down and the RSI is in the negative zone. Therefore, the bears may take one more shot at breaking the trendline support. If they manage to do that, the pair could drop to $42. Conversely, if the bulls can sustain the price above $47.7845, a move to $50 and then to $51.50 is likely.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/19: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BNB, LINK, DOT, ADA, LTC, BSV     ","Crypto market sentiment appears to be improving across the board and the global push to mainstream central bank digital currencies is also making headway.  In China’s Shenzhen province about 2 million people had applied for the  digital yuan giveaway  and the lucky 50,000 among them received “red envelopes” of digital yuan totalling $1.5 million. By the end of Oct. 18 about 47,573 of the recipients had spent roughly $1.3 million of the bounty, amounting to 88% of the total giveaway. This suggests that the pilot program was a success and shows that China is far ahead of other developed economies in developing their central bank digital currency.. To speed up the process of launching its CBDC, the Bank of Canada recently listed a  job opening  for an economist with thorough knowledge of financial technology and digital currencies. However, U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell seems unfazed by the  progress  other countries are making with CBDCs. According to Powell, “it’s more important for the United States to get it right than it is to be first.” Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 In other news, a survey by Statista shows that only  7% of Americans  have used or owned Bitcoin ( BTC ). This figure is far less than Nigeria where the penetration rate is 32%, but also higher than Germany and Japan. This shows that the asset class has a long way to go before it can truly become a ‘mainstream’ currency. Currently, the bearish sentiment that dominated the markets for the past month appears to be alleviating as Bitcoin price moves closer the the $12K level. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to spot the ones that may perform well in the short-term. BTC/USD BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Bitcoin ( BTC ) has risen to the resistance line of the ascending channel where it could face selling pressure from the bears. However, the upsloping 20-day exponential moving average ($11,201) and the relative strength index above 67 suggests that bulls are in command. If the bulls can exploit this advantage and push the price above the channel, the up-move could pick up momentum and quickly rally to $12,048.05. A breakout of this level may challenge the yearly highs at $12,460. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. They will try to stall the rally at the resistance line. If the price turns down from the current levels but stays above $11,500, then the BTC/USD pair could slowly grind higher inside the channel. The first sign of weakness will be a break below $11,178, and the trend will turn in favor of the bears if they can sink the price below the support line of the channel. ETH/USD The bears could not sustain Ether ( ETH ) below the moving averages on Oct. 16 and 17. This attracted buying and the bulls will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $395. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA ($368) has started to turn up slowly, and the RSI has risen above 57, which suggests that bulls are attempting a comeback. If the bulls can push and close (UTC time) the price above $395, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern. This bullish setup has a target objective of $478, just below the 52-week highs at $488.134. This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or from $395 and plunges below the uptrend line. Such a move could keep the pair range-bound between $308.392 and $395 for a few more days. XRP/USD Although  XRP  broke below the moving averages on Oct. 15, the bears could not capitalize on this advantage and sink the price to the bottom of the range at $0.2295. This suggests a lack of sellers at lower levels. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls have currently propelled the price back above the moving averages. If they can sustain the higher levels, there will be another attempt to clear the $0.26 hurdle. A breakout and close (UTC time) above $0.26 is likely to start a new uptrend that may reach $0.2905 and then $0.303746. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the XRP/USD pair turns down from the current levels or $0.26, the range-bound action could continue for a few more days. BCH/USD The bulls have held the critical support at $242 for the past two days, and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) is now attempting to resume its up-move. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($241) and the RSI above 58 indicates that the bulls are in control. The first target on the upside is $266.46, and if that is scaled, the up-move can reach $280. However, if the bulls fail to push the price above $266.46, the BCH/USD pair could remain range-bound for a few days. A break and close (UTC time) below the moving averages will indicate weakness and could pull the price down to $200. BNB/USD The support at $29.5646 is acting as a new floor for Binance Coin ( BNB ). Both moving averages continue to rise, and the RSI has been sustaining in the positive zone for the past few days, which suggests that bulls are in command. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls will now again try to push the price above the $32– $33.3888 resistance zone. If they can pull it off, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and challenge the all-time highs at $39.5941. This bullish view will be negated if the BNB/USD pair turns down from the current levels or from the overhead resistance and sustains below the 20-day EMA ($29.17). Such a move could drag the price down to the 50-day simple moving average ($26.83). LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has held above the 20-day EMA ($10.52) for the past three days but the bulls have not been able to push the price back above the $11.1990–$11.8028 resistance. This suggests that demand is drying up at higher levels. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. The momentum could pick up after the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance zone. The first target is $13.28 and then $18. This bullish view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below $10.15. Such a move could pull the price down to the $8.7975 support. DOT/USD The failure of the bears to sink Polkadot ( DOT ) to $3.5321 suggests that lower levels are attracting buying by the bulls. If the buyers can push the price above the downtrend line, the bearish descending triangle setup will be invalidated. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Above the downtrend line, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $4.6112 and if this level is crossed, the rally may extend to $5.5899. However, the bears are unlikely to give up without a fight. The sellers will try to reverse the direction from the current levels and again at $4.6112. If the pair turns down from either resistance, it could again drop to $3.5321. A breakdown and close (UTC time) below $3.5321 will signal that bears are back in command. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($0.103), which shows that the sentiment is positive and the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. The buyers will once again try to push the price above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can manage a close (UTC time) above the resistance line, a rally to $0.128062 and then to $0.1445 is possible. The upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the resistance line, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the 20-day EMA and the support line of the wedge. If they can do that, the advantage will tilt in favor of the bears. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has bounced off the uptrend line and the bulls will now try to push the price above the moving averages. If the buyers can sustain the price above the moving averages, a move to the overhead resistance zone of $51–$52.36 is possible. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bulls are unlikely to have it easy as the bears will try to defend the moving averages. If the LTC/USD pair turns down and breaks below the uptrend line, a drop to $42 will be on the cards. Currently, the flat 20-day EMA ($47.99) and the RSI at the midpoint suggests a balance between supply and demand. Hence, the price action could remain volatile for the next few days as both the bulls and the bears try to dominate proceedings. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the resistance zone will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that may signal the start of a new uptrend. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) is attempting to stage a recovery but the rebound off the Oct. 16 intraday lows lacks strength. This suggests that the bulls are in no hurry to buy as they are not confident that the bottom is in place. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the advantage is with the bears. If the bulls do not push the price above the moving averages within the next few days, the bears will make one more attempt to sink the price to $146.20. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages, the BSV/USD pair could move up to $180.63. A breakout and close (UTC time) above this resistance could start a journey to $189 and then to $227.

binance,Markets,"Tether Still Dominates Stablecoins, but USDC and Dai Are Winning DeFi","While tether ( USDT ), with a market cap surpassing $16 billion, continues to hold the lion’s share of stablecoins in circulation, two smaller rivals are trouncing it in crypto’s hottest market this year,  decentralized finance  (DeFi).   Measured by the total value locked in six of the most popular DeFi protocols – Compound, Maker, Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Balancer – USD coin ( USDC ) is in the lead among stablecoins followed by dai  (DAI) , the native stablecoin to MakerDAO. That’s according to data compiled by Flipside Crypto as of Oct. 19.  USDC and DAI have market caps of $2.74 billion and $608 million, respectively. Yet, unlike on centralized exchanges, where tether is the go-to stablecoin in dollar-based crypto trades, USDC and DAI seem to have found their niche as the preferred stablecoins in decentralized trades. The total value locked by day aggregated across Compound, Maker, Uniswap, Curve, Aave and Balancer for DAI, PAX, USDC and USDT. In an interview with CoinDesk, Jeremy Allaire, peer-to-peer payments company Circle’s co-founder, attributed USDC’s success in DeFi to his company’s early efforts in building relationships with the DeFi communities. The fact the two companies that co-founded USDC's governing Centre consortium, Circle and crypto exchange Coinbase, are both registered financial entities in the United States may also have something to do with USDC's recent upturn. According to Allaire, USDC is preferred by institutional investors for being “safe, trusted and regulated.” Read more:  Total Stablecoin Supply Nearly Doubled in Q3, Adding Record $8B Authorities around the globe are giving more direction on how cryptocurrencies should be used and regulated.  In late September , for instance, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) published its first regulatory guidance for stablecoins, clarifying that national banks can provide services to stablecoin issuers in the U.S.  “Having guidelines creates more certainty, which makes mainstream market participants ready and willing to engage in it,” Allaire told CoinDesk. In contrast to USDC, dai is a decentralized stablecoin that in theory does not have a centralized issuer and is censorship-resistant. Niklas Kunkel, the head of backend services at MakerDAO, told CoinDesk DAI's decentralization core has made it more popular than most of its competitors. He sees its decentralization as a good thing for regulators.  “One advantage you have from a decentralized stablecoin is that everything is completely transparent,” Kunkel told CoinDesk in an interview. “So from a regulatory point of view, this is almost like their dream scenario, right? Because they can see exactly how many dai are in existence and in circulation and they can see in real time.” “Dai is not the antithesis to regulation and regulator,” he added. “If anything, it's the opposite.” For stablecoin king tether, more than a few market participants question whether it is as transparent as the company claims. Tether the company has been  battling multiple lawsuits  accusing it of  not properly backing its currency with collateralized reserves. Tether has declined to answer CoinDesk’s questions on the lawsuits. However, in an email, Chief Technology Officer Paolo Ardoino called tether “the most stable and liquid stablecoin.” That assertion is challenged by at least some of its competitors.  Read more:  ‘No Other Option but More Collateral’: The Short- (and Long-) Term Fixes for Dai’s Broken Peg “Tether is not fully backed with dollars and there is very little transparency into their reserves,” the head of strategy at Paxos, Walter Hessert, wrote in an email response to CoinDesk. “That’s ok for some crypto traders because there are very liquid markets today. However, mainstream investors and institutions prefer stablecoins they can trust.” According to Tether’s website, its USDT stablecoin is backed by cash and equivalents “and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities.”  Paxos’ stable of stablecoins, including Paxos standard token (PAX), Binance USD (BUSD) and Huobi (HUSD), are all approved by regulators and are fully backed on a one-to-one basis with U.S. dollars, according to Hessert. Tether’s first-mover advantage may have been the leading reason for its overall dominance, but even in Asia, which  has historically driven demand in USDT , traders are beginning to turn to other stablecoins for liquidity. “We have seen a lot of guys in Asia are starting to trade more BUSD and USDC instead of tether,” Darius Sit, co-founder of Singapore-based crypto trading firm QCP Capital, told CoinDesk in an interview. “USDC is more fungible, meaning that it can be exchanged one to one anytime. The spread is tighter.” The total stablecoin supply  in the third quarter nearly doubled from the second quarter , and the total market capitalization of stablecoins has also breached $20 billion at press time, according to  data  from CoinGecko. That’s still relatively smaller than what’s found in traditional finance, a fact giving optimism to many in the stablecoin business hoping to overtake tether.  “When you think about the size of dollar money markets, it’s like four trillion"" dollars, Allaire said. “So clearly, tokenized dollars that are used in a really wide variety of applications should be eventually [worth] hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars.”",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/10/21/tether-still-dominates-stablecoins-but-usdc-and-dai-are-winning-defi/,coindesk,2020-10-21,09:00:00,en,858,5479,5.362470862470863,321,0.3741258741258741,tether usdt market cap surpassing continues hold lion share stablecoins circulation smaller rival trouncing crypto hottest market decentralized finance defi measured total locked popular defi protocol compound maker uniswap curve aave balancer usd coin usdc lead stablecoins dai dai native stablecoin makerdao data compiled flipside crypto usdc dai market cap unlike centralized exchange tether stablecoin based crypto trade usdc dai found niche preferred stablecoins decentralized trade total locked aggregated compound maker uniswap curve aave balancer dai pax usdc usdt interview coindesk allaire peer peer payment company circle founder attributed usdc success defi company effort building relationship defi community fact company founded usdc governing centre consortium circle crypto exchange coinbase registered financial entity united state usdc recent upturn allaire usdc preferred institutional investor safe trusted regulated total stablecoin supply doubled adding record authority globe giving direction cryptocurrencies regulated late instance office comptroller currency occ published regulatory guidance stablecoins clarifying national provide service stablecoin issuer guideline creates certainty make mainstream market participant engage allaire told coindesk contrast usdc dai decentralized stablecoin theory centralized issuer censorship resistant niklas backend service makerdao told coindesk dai decentralization made popular competitor see decentralization thing regulator advantage decentralized stablecoin completely transparent told coindesk interview regulatory point view dream scenario dai existence circulation time dai antithesis regulation regulator added opposite stablecoin tether market participant question transparent company claim tether company battling multiple lawsuit accusing properly backing currency collateralized reserve tether declined answer coindesk question lawsuit email chief technology officer paolo ardoino called tether stable liquid stablecoin assertion challenged competitor option collateral term fix dai broken tether fully backed dollar transparency reserve strategy paxos hessert wrote email response coindesk crypto trader liquid market today mainstream investor institution prefer stablecoins trust tether website usdt stablecoin backed equivalent time time include asset receivables loan made tether party include affiliated entity paxos stable stablecoins including paxos standard token pax binance usd busd huobi husd approved regulator fully backed basis dollar hessert tether mover advantage leading reason dominance historically driven demand usdt trader beginning turn stablecoins liquidity lot guy starting trade busd usdc tether sit founder singapore based crypto trading firm qcp capital told coindesk interview usdc fungible meaning exchanged anytime spread tighter total stablecoin supply doubled total market capitalization stablecoins breached press time data coingecko smaller found traditional finance fact giving optimism stablecoin business hoping overtake tether size market dollar allaire tokenized dollar wide variety application eventually hundred billion trillion dollar,0.044,positive,0.41800000000000004,"{'neg': 0.031, 'neu': 0.817, 'pos': 0.153, 'compound': 0.9929}",0.9929,0.031,0.817,0.153,positive,0.0,0.08130081278780267,neutral

Ultimately, this move by PayPal proves that companies cannot ignore the rise of digital assets anymore. Although the news is bullish, a vertical rally may not materialize immediately. After the initial buying frenzy dies down, the extent of any future correction will confirm whether a new roaring bull market has begun or if institutional investors used this news to lighten up their positions in order to buy at lower levels. Let’s analyze the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies and spot the critical levels to watch out for. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) soared above the resistance line of the ascending channel on Oct. 20. That was followed by a sharp up-move today when the bulls propelled the price above the stiff overhead resistance at $12,460. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A new 52-week high is generally a bullish sign. The breakout of the ascending channel gives the BTC/USD pair a target objective of $12,975. If this level is crossed, the rally may extend to $14,000. The current up-move has pushed the relative strength index to 80. Previous instances show that the risk of a correction increases when the RSI rises above 80. The first sign of weakness will be a break and close (in UTC) below the previous resistance turned support at $12,000. Conversely, if the bulls can arrest the next correction at $12,000, it will signal strength and increase the possibility of a resumption of the up-move. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) has held above the 20-day exponential moving average ($370) for the past few days. The failure of the bears to break this support has attracted buying from the aggressive bulls who are trying to sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $395. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $478. The gradually upward-sloping 20-day EMA and the RSI above 61 suggest a marginal advantage to the bulls. However, the bears are unlikely to throw in the towel so easily. They will attempt to defend the overhead resistance at $395. If the ETH/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the uptrend line, it will signal weakness. XRP/USD XRP  is currently range-bound between $0.26 and $0.2295. After failing to sustain above the moving averages for the past two days, the altcoin has made a decisive move higher today. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can sustain the momentum and push the price above $0.26, the XRP/USD pair will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern. This setup has a target objective of $0.30. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls fail to push the price above $0.26, the bears will again try to sink the price below the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) broke down and closed (in UTC) below the critical support at $242 on Oct. 20, but the bears could not capitalize on this weakness. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The BCH/USD pair has surged today, which shows strong buying by the bulls and short covering by the aggressive bears who may have opened short positions hoping for a fall to $200. If the bulls can sustain the momentum and push the price above $266.46, the pair could rally to $280 and then to $300. The bounce in the RSI from 50 shows strength. This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sell the current rally and sink the pair below the $237.69. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) broke and closed (in UTC) below the $29.5646 support and the 20-day EMA ($29) on Oct. 21. However, the bears could not capitalize on this advantage by intensifying selling. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls are currently attempting to push the price back above the downtrend line. If the BNB/USD pair closes above the downtrend line, a rally to $31.9798 and then to $33.3888 is possible. Conversely, if the price turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to sink the pair below the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could decline to the 50-day simple moving average of $27. LINK/USD Chainlink (LINK) turned down from the overhead resistance at $11.199 on Oct. 19 and plunged below the moving averages on Oct. 20. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bulls are not willing to surrender without a fight. They are currently attempting to push the price above the $11.199–$11.8029 overhead resistance zone. If they succeed and the LINK/USD pair closes above the resistance zone, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $15. On the contrary, if the pair once again turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the price below the uptrend line. If that happens, a decline to $8.3817 is possible. DOT/USD The bulls are struggling to push Polkadot (DOT) above the 20-day EMA ($4.14) and the bears are finding it difficult to sink the price below $3.80. This has kept the altcoin stuck inside a tight range. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Usually, a squeeze is followed by expansion. If the bulls can push the price above the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $4.6112 and that could be followed by a rally to $5.5899. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen sharply to the midpoint. This suggests that the selling pressure has reduced. However, if the price once again turns down from the overhead resistance and slips below $3.80, a retest of the $3.5321 is possible. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) price soared today and has reached the critical $51–$52.36 overhead resistance zone. If the altcoin can close above this zone, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This bullish reversal pattern has a target objective of $61. The moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI has risen above 63, which suggests an advantage to the bulls. However, the bears will pose a stiff challenge in the resistance zone. If the pullback from the current level is shallow, it will suggest that traders are not booking profits at the resistance and this will increase the possibility of the start of a new uptrend. On the contrary, if the price turns down from the current levels and the bulls fail to arrest the decline above $50, the LTC/USD pair may again drop down to the moving averages. ADA/USD The bulls have once again purchased the dip to the support line of the rising wedge pattern. They will now try to push Cardano ( ADA ) to the resistance line of the wedge. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, it is unlikely to be an easy task because the flat 20-day EMA ($0.10) and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The bears will try to stall the recovery at the downtrend line. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will make one more attempt to drag the ADA/USD pair below the wedge. On the other hand, if the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, a move to the resistance line of the wedge is possible. A breakout of the wedge could start a new uptrend. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) largely remains range-bound between $180.63 and $146.20. The bulls are currently attempting to sustain the price above the moving averages. If they can do that, the altcoin could move up to the downtrend line and then to $180.63. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView On the other hand, if the price turns down from the downtrend line, the bears will try to sink the BSV/USD pair to $146.20. Currently, the flattish moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $180.63 or the bears break the support at $146.20. Until then, volatile range-bound action is likely to continue.

binance, News , Yearn Finance doppelganger scam tries to trick visitors out of their keys ,"Decentralized finance yield farming platform Yearn Finance has a doppelganger that is tricking visitors into sharing the private keys of their cryptocurrency wallets. The scam website of Yearn Finance perfectly copies almost every aspect of the original yearn.finance website down to its design, website copy and even domain name. The scammers behind the website chose the domain name “yaerm.finance,” making it look extremely similar to “yearn.finace.”  They have also promoted their landing page for the search keyword “yearn finance” so it shows up on top of the search results when people search for the actual real website. The fake address (in red) above the genuine address (in green). Once a user clicks the ad, it directs them to the yaerm.finance page that looks exactly like Yearn Finance’s official website. However, after scrolling down from the first window that appears, one finds that the website contains a strange guide to ""seven easy hairstyles."" Similar to the original website, the scam website also has six different options in the first window. These include Dashboard, Vaults, Earn, Zap, Cover and Stats. Irrespective of what option a user clicks, it directs them to a page that prompts users to connect their wallets. When users try to connect their wallets, the scam site presents a list of crypto wallets they may choose from. Then, it shows a pop up that asks the users to share the private key or passphrase. Doppelganger scams are relatively common in the crypto space. Another website is posing as Trust Wallet to cheat crypto users.  Crypto India  wrote  on Twitter that scammers have been sending Binance Coin ( BNB ) dust — a very small fraction of a cryptocurrency that cannot be exchanged or transacted — to random cryptocurrency wallets. Each of these transactions had a memo that notified users that they had won 30 or 50 BNB tokens and contained an external link to “claim” those tokens. The Trust Wallet-like website has a call-to-action button that reads “Claim Prize” and upon clicking, opens a window that requests the users to enter their private keys. Users who are new to crypto and are not aware of the importance of keeping their private keys “private” may easily fall for these scams and give the scammers easy access to their funds.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/yearn-finance-doppelganger-scam-tries-to-trick-visitors-out-of-their-keys,cointelegraph,2020-10-22,00:00:00,en,379,2282,5.013192612137203,147,0.38786279683377306,decentralized finance yield farming platform yearn finance doppelganger tricking visitor sharing private cryptocurrency wallet scam website yearn finance perfectly copy aspect original yearn finance website design website copy domain scammer website chose domain yaerm finance making extremely similar yearn finace promoted landing search keyword yearn finance show top search result people search actual website fake address genuine address user click ad directs yaerm finance yearn finance official website scrolling window appears find website guide easy hairstyle similar original website scam website option window include dashboard vault earn zap stats irrespective option user click directs prompt user connect wallet user connect wallet scam site present list crypto wallet choose show pop asks user share private passphrase doppelganger scam common crypto space website posing trust wallet cheat crypto user crypto wrote twitter scammer sending binance coin bnb dust fraction cryptocurrency exchanged transacted random cryptocurrency wallet transaction memo notified user bnb token contained external claim token trust wallet website action read claim prize clicking open window request user enter private user crypto aware importance keeping private private easily fall scam give scammer easy access fund,0.125,positive,0.4885416666666667,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.712, 'pos': 0.178, 'compound': 0.8885}",0.8885,0.109,0.712,0.178,positive,0.1428571224489825,0.040697674181990266,positive

According to a company  blog post  Friday, the Seychelles-based exchange said it was adding DeFi token yearn.finance (YFI) to its  quanto  futures contracts.  Polkadot (DOT) and Binance coin (BNB) contracts are also on the way. All three contracts will be paired against the dollar-linked  tether  (USDT) stablecoin. Currently live on BitMEX's testnet, the products are slated to start trading on Oct. 30 at 04:00 UTC.  Yearn.finance is currently the ninth largest DeFi protocol, with $458 million locked up in liquidity, according to  DeFi Pulse . It  sets out to be the gateway  to a range of yield-generating products. Meanwhile, DOT is the native token of Polkadot, a protocol for connecting decentralized applications and services, and BNB powers the ecosystem of cryptocurrency exchange Binance. ""These three contracts aim to provide our users with quality coverage of highly liquid products,"" BitMEX said. The exchange rarely lists new contracts: last month it announced upcoming listings for  Chainlink and Tezos futures , the first additions for two years. BitMEX was  recently charged by U.S. authorities  for allegedly facilitating unregistered trading.  It's since undergone a  major leadership shakeup  and brought in its  first chief compliance officer .

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/23: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BNB, LINK, DOT, LTC, ADA, BSV     ","PayPal’s crypto announcement acted as a trigger that drove Bitcoin ( BTC ) price to a new 52-week high. During such news-based events, traders holding short positions are caught off guard and are forced to cover their trades, resulting in the type of short squeeze seen during the Oct. 21 rally. Cryptocurrency market weekly performance. Source: Coin360.com However, after this initial burst, the next leg of the uptrend is only possible if demand picks up and the bulls continue to buy at higher levels. Data from Huobi exchange suggests that  pro traders are not convinced that the current rally warrants the opening of long positions  and Cointelegraph contributor Marcel Pechman explained that this could be a bearish signal. On the other hand, the  open interest  on CME Bitcoin futures paints a different picture. The CME has now become the second biggest Bitcoin futures exchange in terms of open interest, second only to OKEx. This suggests that institutional demand could be picking up. This opposing set of data from Bitcoin futures exchanges only adds to the confusion among traders about the next possible move. Let’s go a little deep into the psychology of the traders for a better understanding. Institutional investors rarely buy because of FOMO as they are generally more averse to These large traders may wait for the rally to sustain and complete a successful retest of the breakout level before buying. Let’s take a look at the top-10 cryptocurrencies in order to determine what the technical indicators project. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) broke out and closed above the $12,460 resistance on Oct. 21. This move helped the cryptocurrency notch a new 52-week high, which is a sign of strength. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day exponential moving average ($11,679) is sloping up and the 50-day simple moving average ($10,943) has also started to rise. This shows that both the short-term and the medium-term trend favors the bulls. However, the rally above $13,000 pushed the relative strength index close to 81, a level which attracted profit booking the last two times it was reached. The BTC/USD pair is facing selling above $13,000 but the bulls do not seem to be in a hurry to close their positions. If the pair does not drop below $12,460 within the next few days, it will increase the possibility of a rally to $14,000. On the contrary, if the bears can pull the price below the $12,460–$12,050 support zone, it will suggest a lack of demand at higher levels. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bear trap. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) broke out and closed above $395 on Oct. 22. This move completed the ascending triangle pattern, which has a target objective of $478. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The rising 20-day EMA ($377) and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that the bulls have the upper hand. However, the bears are currently trying to pull the price back below the breakout level of $395. If they succeed, it will signal that the current breakout was a fake one. The next support on the downside is the uptrend line. Conversely, if the ETH/USD pair rebounds off $395, it will suggest that the breakout is valid. The uptrend could pick up momentum after the bulls push the price above $421. XRP/USD XRP  attempted to rise above the $0.2295–$0.26 range on Oct. 21 but the bulls could not close the price above $0.26. This suggests a lack of buyers at higher levels. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The failure of the XRP/USD pair to break out of the range could have attracted profit booking. If the price breaks below the moving averages, it will suggest that the range-bound action is likely to extend for a few more days. Contrary to this assumption, if the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA ($0.24), the bulls will once again attempt to drive the pair above the $0.26–$0.265763 resistance zone. A breakout and close (UTC time) above the resistance zone will complete an inverted head and shoulders pattern that could signal the start of a new uptrend with a target objective of $0.30. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) is currently facing selling near the overhead resistance at $280. This shows that the bears are trying to keep the price below this level. If they succeed, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($247) is possible. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the oversold zone suggest that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the bulls can push the price above $280, a move to $300 is possible. This level could act as resistance but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, the BCH/USD pair could resume the uptrend and reach $326.30–$337.90. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the critical support at $242. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) broke above the downtrend line on Oct. 22. This suggests that the correction could be over. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 56 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push the price above $31.9798, a retest of the 52-week high at $33.3888 is possible. A breakout and close above this level could resume the uptrend that can challenge the all-time high at $39.5941. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price continues to decline from the current levels and plummet below $28.50. Such a move could start a deeper correction to $22. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) completed an ascending triangle pattern when it broke and closed above $11.8028 on Oct. 22. The target objective of this bullish setup is $15. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($10.71) and the RSI above 57 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bears are not willing to let bulls have their way. They are currently attempting to drag the price back below the $11.199–$11.8028 support zone. If they manage to do that, it will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. On the other hand, if the bears fail to sustain the price below the support zone, it will indicate that the bulls are accumulating on dips. This could increase the possibility of a rally to $13.28 and higher. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) closed above the 20-day EMA ($4.17) on Oct. 22. The bulls will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $4.6112. A close above this resistance could drive the price to $5.5899. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen above the 50 levels for the first time in more than a month. This suggests that the selling pressure has reduced and the bulls are attempting to make a comeback. However, if the price again slips back below the 20-day EMA, the DOT/USD pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. The pair may turn negative if the bears sink the pair below the critical support at $3.5321. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) completed an inverse head and shoulders pattern when it broke out and closed above the $51–$52.36 resistance zone. The pattern target of this bullish reversal setup is $61. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping 20-day EMA ($49) and the RSI near the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control. However, after the initial run-up, the price may retest the breakout zone of $51–$52.36. If the bulls purchase the dip to this zone and the price recovers sharply, it will suggest that the zone may act as a floor in the future. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears drag and sustain the LTC/USD pair below $51. Such a move will suggest that the current breakout was a bull trap. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) has been trading inside a rising wedge pattern for the past few days. The bulls have failed to push the price above the immediate resistance at $0.1142241, which shows a lack of demand at higher levels. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The rising wedge is usually considered as a bearish setup. The pattern will complete when the price drops and closes below the support line of the wedge. Such a move could drag the price down to $0.090 and then to $0.0755701. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.10) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. If the buyers can propel the price above the wedge, the ADA/USD pair could start an up-move that may reach $0.01445. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) has formed a symmetrical triangle pattern, which shows indecision among the bulls and the bears. Although the bulls had pushed the price above the triangle on Oct. 22, they could not sustain the higher levels. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The price has turned down from the downtrend line and the bears will now try to sink the BSV/USD pair to the uptrend line of the triangle. If this support cracks, a drop to $146.20 is possible. Conversely, if the pair rebounds off the uptrend line, the bulls will once again attempt to push the price above the triangle. If they can pull it off, a rally to $180.63 and then to $227 could be on the cards.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/26: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, DOT, LTC, BSV, ADA      ","Morgan Creek Digital co-founder  Anthony Pompliano highlighted data from Santiment, which showed that the 30-day rolling correlation  between Bitcoin ( BTC ) and the S&P 500 is 0. Pomp stressed that the lack of correlation shows that Bitcoin is a store of value.  Along with that, Bitcoin has also outperformed most traditional asset classes such as gold, the S&P 500, crude oil, and the U.S. dollar since the sector wide crash that took place in March when coronavirus fears reached a peak. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 Abra Co-founder and CEO Bill Barhydt recently said that “Bitcoin is the single best investment opportunity in the world right now” and he has  substantially  increased his Bitcoin holdings in the past few days. After the recent purchase, about 50% of Barhydt’s total investment portfolio is now held in Bitcoin. Is Bitcoin likely to resume its uptrend or will it take a pause and consolidate for a few days before starting the next trending move? Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out. BTC/USD The bulls are struggling to propel Bitcoin ( BTC ) above the $13,200–$13,343.66 resistance zone. This suggests that after the initial frenzy, buying has dried up at higher levels. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The failure to sustain above $13,200 could attract profit booking by the short-term traders that may result in a pullback to the $12,460–$12,050 support zone. However, the upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought territory, shows that the bulls are in command. Therefore, the bulls might buy the dip to the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,034). If the BTC/USD pair rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to resume the uptrend. If they succeed, a rally to $14,000 is likely. Conversely, if the bears can sink the pair below the 20-day EMA, a fall to the 50-day simple moving average ($11,109) is possible. ETH/USD The tight range consolidation of the past three days has resolved the downside. The bears have dragged Ether ( ETH ) back below $395 but the bulls are attempting to keep the price above the 20-day EMA ($383). ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the ETH/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA and rises above $400, it will suggest strong accumulation at lower levels. A breakout of $420 will signal the possible resumption of the uptrend. However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the uptrend line may intensify the selling. XRP/USD The failure of the bulls to push  XRP  above the $0.26 resistance in the past few days may have attracted profit booking by the short-term traders. The altcoin has broken below the 20-day EMA ($0.249) and is currently attempting to stay above the 50-day SMA ($0.244). XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the XRP/USD pair rebounds off the 50-day SMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $0.26. If they can pull it off, the pair is likely to pick up momentum and rally to $0.30. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, the pair could extend its stay inside the $0.2295–$0.26 range for a few more days. The flattening moving averages and the RSI just below 50 also point to a possible range-bound action in the short-term. BCH/USD The failure of the bulls to propel Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) above the $280 resistance attracted profit booking by the short-term traders. This selling has dragged the price down to the 20-day EMA ($252). BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the BCH/USD pair rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA, it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The bulls will then again try to push the price above the overhead resistance at $280. If they succeed, the rally may extend to $300 and above it to $326.30. Conversely, if bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could drop to $242. Such a move will suggest that the pair could remain range-bound for a few more days. The RSI has formed a negative divergence, which suggests that the bullish momentum may be weakening. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has turned down from close to $13 levels and the bears will now attempt to pull the price back below the $11.8028–$11.1990 support zone. If they succeed, it will suggest that the recent breakout of $11.8028 was a bull trap. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A break below the moving averages could signal further weakness and the trend will turn in favor of the bears if the uptrend line also fails to provide support. On the other hand, if the LINK/USD pair rebounds off the $11.8028-$11.1990 support, it will suggest that the bulls are buying the dips. The bulls will then make one more attempt to propel the pair above $13.28. If they succeed, the uptrend is likely to pick up momentum with a rally to $15 and then to $17. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) remains in an uptrend and the bulls have held the support at $29.5646 for the past four days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 57 signals that bulls are in command. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can thrust the BNB/USD pair above the $32–$33.3888 resistance zone, the uptrend may pick up momentum. A breakout of the resistance zone increases the possibility of a retest of the all-time highs. Contrary to this assumption, the first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA ($29.68) and the pair could signal a deeper correction if it sustains below the 50-day SMA ($27.91). DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) broke above the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Oct. 24. This bullish setup has a target objective of $5.40. The bulls are currently attempting to push and sustain the price above the overhead resistance at $4.6112. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the buyers can manage to sustain the price above $4.6112, the momentum is likely to pick up. The 20-day EMA ($4.22) has flattened out and the RSI has risen above 59, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced. This positive view will be invalidated if the DOT/USD pair turns around from the current levels and plummets below the moving averages. Such a move will suggest that the break above the neckline was a bull trap. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) turned around from the $60 mark as traders booked profits following the sharp gains of the past few days. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 62 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The LTC/USD pair has corrected to the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361 and if this support cracks, a drop to the 50% retracement level of $53.3915 is likely. If the pair bounces from either level, it will suggest buying on dips. In such a case, the bulls will again try to resume the up-move by driving the price above $60. If they succeed, the pair could rally to $64 and then to $68.9008. This bullish view will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the breakout zone of $51–$52.36. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) broke above the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 24 but the bulls could not build up on the strength and push the price above the overhead resistance at $180.63. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This has resulted in profit booking that has dragged the price close to the 20-day EMA ($167). A break below the moving averages could pull the price down to the uptrend line of the triangle. On the contrary, if the BSV/USD pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $180.63. If they are successful, a rally to $208 and then to $227 is possible. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) has broken down of the support line of the rising wedge pattern and the 20-day EMA ($0.10). The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at the 50-day SMA ($0.099). ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the ADA/USD pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will make one more attempt to drive the price above $0.1142241. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, a drop to $0.90 and then to $0.755701 is possible. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below 45 suggest that bears have a minor advantage.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/28: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, DOT, LTC, BSV, ADA      ","The equity markets across Europe closed deeply in the red and the U.S. markets are also witnessing intense selling pressure as  investors fear  a rise in COVID-19 cases could stall the fragile economic recovery. This increasingly negative sentiment has also dragged gold and Bitcoin ( BTC ) prices lower, while the U.S. dollar currency index has risen. In 2020, Bitcoin has largely acted as an uncorrelated asset, barring short periods of time when it has followed the S&P 500 or gold. Therefore, investors should take a l onger-term view  rather than panicking due to short-term volatility. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 A survey by Grayscale has shown that the number of investors who are  familiar with Bitcoin  has risen from 53% in 2019 to 62% this year. The poll also showed that about 55% of the respondents were interested in Bitcoin investment products this year, compared to 36% in 2019. With greater participation from both retail and institutional investors, the crypto markets may become less prone to manipulation and that could in turn attract more investments. When an asset enters a correction, knowing the strong support levels can help traders to make a more informed decision. Therefore, let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies in order to spot the critical levels that may attract buyers. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) has turned down sharply from just under the critical overhead resistance of $13,973.50, which suggests profit-booking by short-term traders and likely initiation of short positions by the aggressive bears. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price closes below $13,041.5, the BTC/USD pair would form a bearish engulfing candlestick pattern, which is a warning sign that the trend may be reversing. The first stop on the downside is the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,289). A break below this support will suggest that the bullish momentum has weakened and that could intensify selling, dragging the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($11,238) However, as the moving averages are sloping up and the relative strength index has corrected its overbought levels, the bulls are likely to buy the dips to the 20-day EMA. A strong bounce off this support will suggest that the sentiment is bullish as traders are buying on dips. ETH/USD The rebound off the 20-day EMA ($385) on Oct. 26 could not sustain the higher levels on Oct. 27 as the bears sold on recovery. This has dragged Ether ( ETH ) below the 20-day EMA today. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears sustain the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to the uptrend line is likely. A break below this support could drag the ETH/USD pair to the next support at $333 and then to $308.096. However, if the price recovers from the current levels and rises above the $400–$420 resistance zone, it will signal an advantage to the bulls. Above $420, the pair could start its journey to $450 and then to $488.134. XRP/USD XRP  continues to trade inside a range as the flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the bears can sink and sustain the price below the 50-day SMA ($0.245), the altcoin could drop to $0.2295. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A break below the $0.2295–$0.2197 support zone could tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. However, if the price rebounds off the support zone, the XRP/USD pair could extend its stay inside the range for a few more days. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the 50-day SMA and rises above the $0.26 resistance, it will indicate that bulls are in command. Above $0.26, the pair could start an up-move that may reach $0.30. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($256) on Oct. 26 and the bulls are currently trying to propel the price above the overhead resistance at $280. If they can pull it off, the altcoin could rise to $300 and then to $326.30. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 62 suggests that the bulls are in control. However, the RSI has formed a negative divergence and a possible symmetrical triangle. If the RSI breaks above the triangle, it will increase the possibility of an up-move in the BCH/USD pair. Conversely, if the RSI breaks below the triangle, it will suggest the start of a pullback. The failure to drive the price above $280 could attract profit-booking by short-term traders. A break below the 20-day EMA ($256) will signal that the momentum has weakened. LINK/USD The rebound off the $11.199 support on Oct. 26 was short-lived as the bulls could not sustain the higher levels on Oct. 27. The bears have jumped on this opportunity and are currently attempting to sink Chainlink ( LINK ) back below $11.199. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the trendline. A break below the trendline could signal an advantage to the bears that may result in a fall to $8.38. On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the bulls will once again try to push the price above $13.28 and extend the recovery to $18. The indicators are not giving any clear signals as both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI has dropped close to the halfway mark, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. BNB/USD The bulls pushed Binance Coin ( BNB ) above the $32 resistance on Oct. 27 but could not sustain the higher levels. This shows that the bears are defending the zone between $32–$33.3888. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The failure to sustain above $32 could have attracted profit booking from the short-term traders. If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($29.94), the BNB/USD pair may drop to the 50-day SMA ($28.24). However, the trend remains up as both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in the positive territory. Therefore, the bulls may attempt to buy on dips to the moving averages. The uptrend will resume on a close above $33.3888. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 50-day SMA, it may increase the possibility of a deeper correction to $26 and then 22. DOT/USD The bulls pushed Polkadot ( DOT ) above the $4.6112 resistance on Oct. 26 but the sellers were in no mood to relent and they aggressively defended the overhead resistance at $5 on Oct. 27. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The failure to sustain above $4.6112 has again dragged the price down to the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern. If the DOT/USD pair rebounds off this support, the bulls will again try to propel the price above $5 and reach the overhead resistance at $5.5899. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the price below the neckline, the pair may again drop to $3.5321. A bounce off this support could keep the pair range-bound for a few days. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) bounced off the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361 on Oct. 26, which showed that the bulls were not willing to wait for lower levels to buy as they expected the uptrend to resume. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Although the bulls had pushed the LTC/USD pair above $60 today, they could not sustain the higher levels. This attracted aggressive selling from short-term traders and the price again dropped to the 38.2% retracement level. If the bears can sink the pair below $54.9361, the correction may extend to $53.2915 and then to $51. However, if the pair again rebounds off $54.9361, a few days of range-bound action is possible. The pair is likely to pick up momentum after the price sustains above $60. BSV/USD The bulls purchased the dip to the breakout level of the symmetrical triangle on Oct. 26 but they could not push Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) above the $180–$185.14 overhead resistance zone on Oct. 27 and start a new uptrend. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The failure to rise above the overhead resistance could have attracted selling by the short-term bulls and the aggressive bears. As a result, the BSV/USD pair has again dropped down to the 20-day EMA ($168). If the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again attempt to propel the price above the overhead resistance zone. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the moving averages, the pair could may to the uptrend line of the triangle and then to $146.20. ADA/USD The long tail on the Oct. 26 candlestick shows that the bulls purchased the dip to the 50-day SMA ($0.098). However, the buyers could not build upon this strength and sustain Cardano ( ADA ) above the 20-day EMA ($0.103) on Oct. 27. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This shows that demand dries up at higher levels. The bears pounced on this sign of weakness and resumed their selling today and have managed to sink the ADA/USD pair below the 50-day SMA. If the price sustains below this level, the next support is at $0.090 and if this support also gives way, the decline could extend to the critical support at $0.0755701. With the latest fall, the 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI has dipped into the negative zone, indicating an advantage to the bears. This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair turns around from the current levels or the immediate support and rises above $0.104044.

binance, Market Update ," Impending pennant breakout sets Bitcoin price back on the path to $14,000  ","As the weekend approaches, Bitcoin ( BTC ) price appears set to close out the month with a remarkably strong performance which has many bulls calling for a new all-time high above $20,000 in the near future.  Traders attribute these lofty estimates to the fact that BTC appears to have flipped $12,000 to $12,500 to support and barring some unexpected price implosion, Bitcoin is on the path to painting a beautiful monthly candle. Crypto market weekly price chart. Source:  Coin360 Further ‘bullish’ evidence comes from today’s options and futures expiry which saw $450 million of futures open interest expiring as of Oct.28. According to Cointelegraph contributor  Marcel Pechman :  “The most recent options expiry for BTC and Ether really provided nothing surprising. Deribit is back to 137K BTC options versus the 150K open yesterday. Meanwhile, CME has $215 million futures open interest expiring on Oct. 30, but this appears to have had a very minimal impact on price, if any at all. Once again, the phenomenon of the pre and post BTC price drop on the occurrence of CME futures expiries no longer exists. This reaffirms the bull case for the recent run, despite the negative news from Asian exchanges and Tether.” Currently, BTC is trading above $13.5K, and the 4-hour chart shows the digital asset making higher lows and lower highs as the price pulls into a tighter range.  BTC/USDT 4-hr chart. Source:  TradingView Even as the price holds above the 20-day moving average, it wouldn’t be unexpected to see it range between $13,500 to $12,900 through the weekend and into early next week.  If Bitcoin price is able to push above the pennant trendline at $13,620 and secure a 4-hour close above it, then a renewed push for a new 2020-high above $13,859 is possible.  Currently, as trading volume increases, the moving average convergence divergence indicator shows the MACD has crossed above the signal line (orange) and the histogram shows an increase in momentum. The RSI is also above the midline, just reaching 60, but for the last few days, BTC has met resistance at $13,660.  In the event that BTC loses its current momentum and drops from the pennant below $13,100, there is support at $12,800. Failure to hold at this level opens the door for a retest of the next support at $12,000 and below this $11,500.  Bitcoin daily price chart. Source:  Coin360 From a bird’s-eye-view, Bitcoin’s current price action is encouraging and the digital asset is clearly in a strong uptrend with room to run higher.  The same cannot be said for altcoins which have taken an absolute pummeling throughout this week. At the time of writing Ether ( ETH ) price is down by 5.8% as the top altcoin struggles to reclaim $400 as support. Chainlink (LINK) has dropped 6.74% and Binance Coin (BNB has lost 6.10%.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 10/30: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, DOT, LTC, BSV, ADA ","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) dominance has risen from about 56% in early September to above 63%. This suggests that the market participants may be rotating their investments out of altcoins to buy Bitcoin. Due to this, several altcoins have either corrected or formed a range. While  legacy markets  are keeping a close eye on the U.S. Presidential elections, Grayscale CEO Barry Silbert believes that  Bitcoin price will gain  irrespective of the result because the next President will continue to print more dollars. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 Using data from CoinMetrics, Twitter user Julio Moreno recently highlighted that if Bitcoin could sustain above $10,000 for four more days, it would complete 100 days above this critical level. History suggests that Bitcoin rallies vertically after it completes  100 days  above a psychologically significant level. Bitcoin’s rally from $10 to $100, a 10-fold rise, took only 122 days after it had spent 100 days above $10. Similarly, a move from $100 to $1000 happened in two days, and the rally from $1,000 to $10,000 was completed in 150 days. Therefore, investors are watching to see whether Bitcoin will continue following its precedence or will it chalk a new course. Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out the path of least resistance. BTC/USD The long tail on the candlesticks of the past two days shows that the bulls are accumulating on dips. However, the failure to sustain Bitcoin ( BTC ) above $13,600 suggests that the bears are attempting to defend the overhead resistance. After the large range day on Oct. 28, the price action could be subdued for a few days as both the bulls and the bears try to gain an upper hand. However, the upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index still in the overbought zone suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The bulls will again try to push the BTC/USD pair above $13,973.50 and if they succeed, the uptrend could resume. Contrary to this assumption, if the index turns down from the current levels and slips below the 20-day exponential moving average ($12,518), the trend could turn in favor of the bears. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) has broken below the 20-day EMA ($385) today but the bulls are attempting to defend the support at the 50-day simple moving average ($370). The uptrend line is also just below this level, hence, a bounce is likely. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, the ETH/USD pair may rise to the $420.50 overhead resistance. A break above this level could increase the possibility of a rally to $450 and then to $488.134. On the other hand, if the bears sink the ETH/USD pair below the uptrend line, a drop to $333 and then to $308.392 is possible. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint do not indicate an advantage to either the bulls or the bears. Hence, the pair could remain range-bound for a few days. XRP/USD After failing to sustain above the $0.26–$0.2295 range on Oct. 22,  XRP  has dropped to the support of the range. However, the long tail on the candlestick today suggests that bulls are using this dip to buy. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout from the range, hence, it is better to wait for the price to break above or below the range before taking a large bet. In a consolidation phase, the signals from the moving averages are choppy. The oversold levels on the RSI are considered as a buying opportunity and overbought levels are used to book profits because the expectation is that the range-bound action will continue. A trending move could be expected if the bears sink the XRP/USD pair below the $0.2295–$0.219712 support zone, while a break above $0.26 will suggest that the bulls are in command. BCH/USD The long wick on the candlestick on Oct. 28 shows that bulls booked profits when Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) failed to rise above $280. Although the bulls purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($256) on Oct. 29, the price has again slipped today. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The RSI has broken down from the symmetrical triangle, which suggests that the bears are attempting to make a comeback. If the bears can sink the price below the 20-day EMA, a drop to $242 is possible. This support could attract buying as the 50-day SMA ($238) is just below it. If the BCH/USD pair rebounds off this support, it could remain range-bound between $280–$242 for a few days. Contrary to this assumption, if the bears sink the pair below the 50-day SMA, a drop to $210 could be on the cards. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has broken below the 20-day EMA ($11.21) support and the bears are now attempting to sink the price below the 50-day SMA ($10.58). If the bears succeed, the altcoin could dip to the uptrend line. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A break below the uptrend line could signal an advantage to the bears and open the gates for a possible decline to $8.38 and then $6.90. Conversely, if the rebound off the current levels or the uptrend line sustains above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to propel the LINK/USD pair above $13.28. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint indicate a balance between supply and demand. This could result in a range-bound action in the short-term. BNB/USD The bears are currently attempting to sink and sustain Binance Coin ( BNB ) below the $28.43 support. If they succeed, the altcoin will complete a double top pattern that could drag the price down to the target objective of $24.86. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA ($29.81) has started to turn down and the RSI has plunged into negative territory, which suggests the bears have the upper hand. However, if the bulls buy the current dip and push the price back above $28.43, the BNB/USD pair could rise to the 20-day EMA where it may face resistance. If the price turns down from this resistance, it will suggest that the sentiment has turned bearish and traders are looking to sell on rallies. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can push the price above $32, it will suggest that the bulls are back in control. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) plummeted back below the neckline of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Oct. 29. This drop has invalidated the bullish reversal pattern. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls are currently trying to find support close to $3.80. If this support cracks, the bears will try to break the $3.5321 support and if they succeed, the DOT/USD pair could start a downtrend that may reach $2.60. On the contrary, if the pair rebounds off the current levels, the pair may again attempt to rise above the moving averages and $4.6112. If that happens, it will suggest that the bulls are accumulating at lower levels. LTC/USD The reversal on Oct. 28 attracted further follow up selling on Oct. 29 and Litecoin ( LTC ) broke the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $54.9361. Currently, the bulls are attempting to defend the $52.36 support. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could consolidate between $52 and $60 for a few days. The flattening 20-day EMA ($53) and the RSI just above the halfway mark also suggest a few days of range-bound action. This assumption will be invalidated if the bears sink the pair below the $52.36–$51 support. If this happens, the pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($49) and below that to $46. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) broke below the 20-day EMA ($167) on Oct. 29 and that has been followed by further selling today. Currently, the altcoin has dropped to the uptrend line of the symmetrical triangle. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A break below the uptrend line could drag the price down to the $146.20 support where the bulls are likely to step in and buy. A bounce off $146.20 could keep the BSV/USD pair stuck inside the range for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory also suggest a balance between supply and demand. This view of a range formation will be invalidated if the bulls push the price above $180.63 or the bears sink the pair below $146.20. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) broke below the 50-day SMA ($0.092) on Oct. 29 and the bears are currently attempting to sink the price below the $0.0893 support. If they succeed, the altcoin may drop to $0.0755701. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.102) and the RSI below 38 indicate that bears are in command. Even if the ADA/USD pair rises from the current levels, the bears will try to sell the bounce to the 20-day EMA. If the pair turns down from this resistance, it will increase the possibility of a break below $0.0893. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the pair above $0.1040440. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels. The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

binance, Price Analysis ," Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, BNB, ADA, BCH, LINK ","Bitcoin ( BTC ) has rallied about 90% year-to-date and has risen close to 191% from its March lows. The rise has been gradual without much fanfare, which suggests that crypto believers are the ones who have been buying in 2020. October’s  monthly close  at $13,798.99 is the highest ever, surpassing the December 2017 close at $13,789.68. The strong performance of Bitcoin may now attract the momentum players and the speculators who look to benefit from the strength. Crypto market weekly performance data. Source:   Coin360 If that happens, then Bitcoin could pick up momentum and surprise investors to the upside. This could result in traders selling their altcoins to invest in Bitcoin. Hence, the  altseason looks to be over  in the short-term. Three of the top-five cryptocurrencies analyzed today may offer a trading opportunity to the upside while the other two may continue to decline further. Let’s watch the critical levels that may indicate the start of a trending move. BTC/USD Bitcoin rose above the $13,973.50 overhead resistance and reached an intraday high of $14,101.91 on Oct. 31. Although the bulls failed to sustain the price above the resistance, they have not given up much ground to the downside. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This suggests that traders are not closing their positions in a hurry because they expect another attempt by the bulls to propel the price above the resistance. Both the 10-day exponential moving average ($13,309) and the 50-day simple moving average ($11,505) are sloping up and the relative strength index is in the overbought territory. This suggests that the bulls are in command. If the BTC/USD pair closes above $14,000, the next leg of the uptrend could begin that can reach $16,500. However, if the bulls again fail to sustain the price above $14,000, then the short-term traders may dump their positions and the bears could initiate short positions. A break below the 10-day EMA will be the first sign that the momentum has weakened. The bears are likely to gain an upper hand if the pair drops and sustains below the critical support at $12,460. BTC/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The pair is currently attempting to hold above the 10-EMA. If that happens and the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the $13,973.50–$14,101.92 resistance zone, a new uptrend is likely. However, the bearish divergence on the RSI suggests that the upside momentum is weakening. If the sellers can sink the pair below the 10-EMA, a drop to the 50-SMA and then to $13,000 will be on the cards. The strong support in the $12,750–$13,000 zone could attract buyers. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) broke below the $28.50 support on Oct. 30 but managed to bounce from the intraday lows and close above $28.50. However, the doji candlestick pattern on Oct. 31 suggested indecision among the bulls and the bears. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are currently attempting to resolve the indecision to the downside and gain the upper hand. If the BNB/USD pair breaks and closes below $27.50, it will increase the possibility of a drop to $24.86. The downsloping 10-day EMA ($29.47) and the RSI in the negative zone suggests that the path of least resistance is to the downside. Contrary to this assumption, if the price reverses direction and rises above $28.50, then it will suggest a few more days of consolidation. BNB/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The 4-hour chart shows that the recovery from $27.5111 is facing stiff resistance at the 10-EMA. A break below $28 could challenge the $27.50 support, which if broken, the next stop could be $26.50. Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is close to the oversold zone, suggesting an advantage to the bears. This view will be invalidated if the pair turns around and rises above $29. Such a move will suggest accumulation at lower levels and will increase the possibility of a rise to $30.50. ADA/USD Cardano ( ADA ) broke below the bearish rising wedge pattern on Oct. 26 and plunged to the $0.0891 support. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the support and push the price above the moving averages. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the downsloping 10-day EMA ($0.988) and the RSI below 43 suggest that bears are in control. Therefore, the bounce is likely to face stiff resistance at the moving averages. If the ADA/USD pair turns down from this resistance, the bears will again try to break the $0.0891 support. Such a move will open the gates for a decline to the next support at $0.0755. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls can push and sustain the price above the moving averages. Such a move could result in a rally to $0.11. ADA/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls have pushed the price above the 10-EMA on the 4-hour chart. The pair could now move up to the 50-SMA where bears may again step in and sell. Although the 50-SMA is still sloping down, the 10-EMA is attempting to turn up and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests that the selling pressure has reduced in the short-term. However, if the pair turns down from the current levels or the 50-SMA, the bears will once again try to sink the price below the $0.0891 support. If they succeed, the next leg of the down move could begin. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) has formed a symmetrical triangle, which usually acts as a continuation pattern. However, as this setup suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears, it is better to wait for the price to break above the triangle before taking a directional bet. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is above 59, which suggests that the bulls have the upper hand. If the bulls can push and sustain the price above the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could move up to $280 and then to $296.87. Contrary to this assumption, if the price breaks below the triangle, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the critical support at $242. The 50-day SMA ($239) is placed just below this support, hence, the bulls may buy a drop to this zone. BCH/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls had pushed the price above the resistance line of the symmetrical triangle but they could not sustain the higher levels and the bears have dragged the price back into the triangle. However, if the pair bounces off the 50-SMA or the 10-EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to propel the price above the triangle. If they succeed, the momentum could pick up and a rally to $280 is likely. This positive view will be negated if the price breaks below the moving averages and drops below the symmetrical triangle. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has been trading inside an ascending channel for the past few days. Although the pace of rise has been slow, the altcoin has been making successive higher highs and higher lows. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The LINK/USD pair is currently correcting after turning down from the overhead resistance at $13. Both moving averages have flattened out and the RSI is close to the midpoint, suggesting a balance between supply and demand. The bulls are likely to purchase the drop to the support line of the channel. If the price rebounds off this support with strength, the bulls may again attempt to push the pair above $13. This positive view will be invalidated if the bears sink the price below the channel. Such a move could drag the price down to $8.3817 and below that to $7.2869. LINK/USD 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls are currently attempting to defend the uptrend line. If they can push the price above the downtrend line, the pair could start its journey towards $13. However, the 10-EMA has flattened out and the RSI has been trading in the negative territory, which suggests that bears are attempting a comeback in the short-term. If the bears can sink the price below the uptrend line, the pair could drop to the support line of the channel.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/4: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, LTC, DOT, ADA, BSV  ","Today Bitcoin ( BTC )  price briefly pushed through the $14,100 resistance to achieve a new 2020 high at $14,259 before pulling back to retest $14,100 as support.  Although this level represents a critical resistance, data suggests that Bitcoin  whales  are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect the current rally to continue. This strong show of confidence is occurring even as there is heightened uncertainty over the result of the U.S. presidential election shows that market participants expect Bitcoin price to move higher regardless of who wins the election. Another bullish sign for Bitcoin is the record  inflow of $215 million  into Grayscale Bitcoin Trust last week. This shows that along with the whales, institutional investors are also bullish on the prospects of Bitcoin.  If investors continue to pour money into Grayscale at the current rate, the fund may hold about 2.7% of Bitcoin’s circulating supply in approximately three weeks. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 During the 2017 bull market, the main driver of Bitcoin price action was the spot market. However, since then, crypto  derivatives volumes  have surged, according to Kraken’s November report.  The spot volumes hit a high of $570 billion in Q1 2018 but dropped off “to a low of $104 billion nearly two years later,” but “derivatives notional volume exploded from below $6B in Q2 2017 to over $1.7T by Q3 2020,"" the report added.  While data suggest greater participation by the professional traders and institutional investors, do the technicals project further upside for Bitcoin and altcoins?  Let’s study the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out.  BTC/USD The bears could not even sink Bitcoin ( BTC ) to the 20-day exponential moving average ($13,057) in the past few days, which showed that the bulls were in no hurry to book profits. This could have attracted another round of buying that has pushed the price to a new 2020 high at $14,259 levels today. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought zone suggest that the bulls are in control. If they can sustain the price above $14,102, the next leg of the up-move is likely to begin. The next major resistance is close to $16,200. However, the RSI is still showing signs of negative divergence, which usually acts as a reliable warning sign that the momentum may be weakening. But in a strong uptrend, the divergence may turn out to be a fake signal unless the price turns lower. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and the BTC/USD pair plummets below the 20-day EMA.  Such a move will suggest that the bears are attempting a comeback and they are likely to gain strength if the pair dips below the $12,460 support. ETH/USD The bulls bought the dip to the uptrend line on Nov. 3 and have followed it up with a breakout of the downtrend line and the $395 resistance today. This suggests that the short-term correction in Ether ( ETH ) could be over. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA ($388) has started to turn up and the RSI has jumped into positive territory, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. If they can push the ETH/USD pair above $420, the rally may extend to $450 and then to $488.134. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and drops below the 50-day simple moving average ($372). XRP/USD The bulls again purchased the dip to the $0.2295 support on Nov. 3 but they could not propel  XRP  above the moving averages. This suggests that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.244) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the bears are in control.  If they can sink the price below $0.2295, the XRP/USD pair could drop to $0.219712. A break below this support may resume the downtrend, with the next support at $0.19. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the moving averages, then a few more days of range-bound action is likely. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) plunged to $231.93 on Nov. 3 but the bulls purchased this dip as seen from the long tail on the candlestick. Today again, the buyers stepped in and bought the decline to $230.90. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This strong rebound suggests that the bulls are attempting to defend the $231.93 support aggressively. However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($255) and the RSI below 42 suggest that bears are in command. Hence, the bears are likely to sell on rallies to the 20-day EMA. If the BCH/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below $231.93, the decline could extend to $210 and then to $200. This negative view will be invalidated if the pair picks up momentum and rises above the 20-day EMA. If that happens, the pair could again rally to the $272 to $280 resistance zone. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) broke below the uptrend line today but the bulls purchased the dip to the $9.7665 support. However, the bears will try to stall the pullback at the 20-day EMA ($11) and then at $11.199. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI has slipped below 44, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. If the bears can sink the price below $9.7665, the LINK/USD pair could drop to $8.3817 and then to $6.90. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls build upon the current bounce and push the price above $11.199. Such a move will increase the possibility of a rally to $13.28. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) closed below $28.43 on Nov. 2, which completed a double top pattern. This setup has a target objective of $24.86 but the bulls are currently attempting to defend the support at $25.6652. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the downsloping 20-day EMA ($28) and the RSI below 37, suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside. If the bears sink the price below $25.6652, the down-move could resume, with the next major support at $22. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls buy the current dip and push the BNB/USD pair back above $28.43. Such a move will open up the possibility of a rally to $32. LTC/USD The bulls aggressively purchased Litecoin ( LTC ) on dips to $51.2027 on Nov. 3 and have again bought the dip to $51.6109 today, as seen from the long tails on the candlesticks. This suggests that the bulls are defending the $52.36 to $51 support zone. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the buyers can sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($53), a rally to $56.50 is possible. However, the flat 20-day EMA and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels, the bears will again try to sink the price below the support zone. If they succeed, the selling may intensify and the pair could drop to the next support at $46. DOT/USD The bears are attempting to sink Polkadot ( DOT ) below $3.80. If they can do that, the altcoin could drop to the critical support at $3.5321. A break below this support could start a new downtrend. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI continues to trade in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears are in control. On a break below $3.5321, the decline could extend to $2.60 and then to $2.00. This bearish view will be invalidated if the bulls defend the $3.80 to $3.5321 support zone and push the price above the moving averages. Such a move could keep the DOT/USD pair range-bound for a few more days. ADA/USD  The long tail on the Nov. 3 candlestick shows that the bulls are buying Cardano ( ADA ) on dips to $0.0893, but today’s price action suggests that they are not able to sustain the momentum at higher levels. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The downsloping 20-day EMA ($0.0990) and the RSI in the negative zone suggest that the bears have the upper hand. Hence, they may attempt to sell the pullback to the 20-day EMA. If the ADA/USD pair breaks below $0.0893, it could drop to $0.0755701. This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages. In such a case, a move to $0.104044 and then to $0.1142241 is possible. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) bounced off $145.20 on Nov. 3 and the bulls are again attempting a rebound off the $146.12 level today. This suggests that the bulls are accumulating on dips to the $146.20 to $135 support zone. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, unless the bulls push the price back above the uptrend line and the moving averages within the next few days, the bears will again try to sink the BSV/USD pair below the support zone. If they succeed, the pair could start a new downtrend that could result in a decline to $100. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($164) and the RSI in the negative territory suggest that the path of least resistance is to the downside.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/6: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, LTC, DOT, ADA, BSV  ","The United States Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently said that additional fiscal  stimulus  could result in a stronger recovery. He also emphasized that the Fed had enough tools to support the economy. After the winner of the U.S. election is announced, the focus of lawmakers could shift to the next stimulus package. However, additional money printing will only worsen the existing national debt which is currently at $27.2 trillion.  Even though a new round of stimulus measures may be required in the short-term to reduce the impact of the economic crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, analysts believe that the Fed may not be able to roll back the measures in the future.  Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 For this reason, apprehensive institutional investors have been hedging their portfolio with gold and a few others like billionaire hedge fund manager Paul Tudor Jones have advocated buying Bitcoin ( BTC ).  Galaxy Digital CEO and investor Mike Novogratz believes that Bitcoin is in a  bull phase . Hence, he recently advised Bitcoin HODLers to sit on their hands and lock away their phones to counter the emotion to book profits after the recent rally. While long-term investors could HODL their positions, short-term traders will have to be alert lest they may give back a large part of their unrealized gains.  Let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to see whether the rally has topped out or if it can extend further. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) closed above $14,000 on Nov. 4 and followed the move with a strong rally on Nov. 5. The price reached an intraday high of $15,956.26 today, which is currently acting as a resistance. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the trend is clearly in favor of the bulls and any dip is likely to be viewed as a buying opportunity. Although the relative strength index has invalidated the negative divergence, it has risen deep into the overbought territory, which suggests that a few days of consolidation or a correction may be around the corner. If the bulls buy the next dip to $14,000, it will suggest that the previous resistance has flipped to support and this level may act as a floor during future declines. Sometimes, during a buying frenzy, the RSI can remain deeply overbought for a long time. Hence, if the bulls can push the price above $16,000, a move to the $17,000–$17,200 resistance zone is possible. This is the final hurdle before a shot at the all-time highs. However, vertical rallies rarely sustain and they usually end with sharp declines. Hence, traders should exercise caution even if the uptrend continues. The bullish view will be invalidated if the BTC/USD pair turns down and plummets below the $14,000 support.  ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) picked up momentum after the bulls pushed the price above the downtrend line on Nov. 4. The upsloping 20-day EMA ($395) and the RSI close to the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in control. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The next target on the upside is $450 and if the bulls can push the price above this resistance, the ETH/USD pair may reach $488.134. Even if the bears offer resistance at $450, the bulls are likely to buy the dips as the sentiment has turned positive. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA and the advantage will turn in favor of the bears if the 50-day SMA ($374) cracks. XRP/USD XRP  has largely been range-bound between $0.2295 and $0.26 for the past few weeks. The failure of the bears to break below the range on Nov. 3 attracted buyers who have pushed the price to the resistance of the range.  XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push and sustain the price above $0.26, the XRP/USD pair could start a new uptrend that may result in a rally to $0.303746. The RSI has risen above 60 for the first time since August, which suggests that the bulls are making a strong comeback. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from the current levels or fails to sustain above $0.26, then a few more days of range-bound action is likely. The trend will turn in favor of the bears if the pair plummets below the $0.2295 to $0.219712 support zone.  BCH/USD The rebound off the $231.93 support has reached the 20-day EMA ($255) where the bears may offer resistance. If Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) turns down from the current levels, the bears will again try to sink the price below $231.93. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the BCH/USD pair could rise to the overhead resistance zone at $272 to $280. The 20-day EMA has flattened out and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests a possible range-bound action in the near term. A breakout of $280 could signal the start of an up-move that may rise to $326 while a break below $231.93 could result in a fall to $200. LINK/USD The long tails on the candlesticks of the past three days show that the bulls accumulated on dips below the uptrend line. They have currently pushed Chainlink ( LINK ) above the downtrend line, which suggests that the correction may be over. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls will now try to push the price to the next overhead resistance at $13.28. A breakout and close above this resistance could complete a bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI just above 55 suggest a range-bound action in the next few days. This view will be invalidated if the LINK/USD pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below $9.7665. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) reversed direction from $25.6652 on Nov. 4 and the bulls are currently trying to sustain the price above the 20-day EMA ($28.83). This move suggests that the bears are losing their grip. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price sustains above the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the BNB/USD pair to the overhead resistance at $32. However, if the pair turns down from the current levels, the bears will once again attempt to break the $25.6652 support. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. This could result in a few more days of range-bound action between $25.6652 and $32. LTC/USD The successful retest of the breakout level of the inverse head and shoulders pattern on Nov. 3 and 4 attracted strong buying from the bulls who have pushed Litecoin ( LTC ) above $60. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is close to the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls are in control. If the bulls sustain the momentum and drive the price above $64, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $68.9008. However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They are currently attempting to stall the up-move at $64 but unless they pull the price back below $60, the advantage will remain with the bulls. DOT/USD The failure of the bears to sink Polkadot ( DOT ) below $3.80 on Nov. 3 and 4 attracted buying and the bulls have pushed the price above the moving averages.  DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The DOT/USD pair is currently range-bound between $3.80 and $4.95. If the bulls can push the price above $4.6112, the pair may attempt to break above $4.95. If that happens, then a rally to $5.5899 is possible. Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has risen into the positive territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. However, if the price turns down from $4.6112 or $4.95, the pair may extend its stay inside the range for a few more days.  ADA/USD  The rebound off the $0.0893 support picked up momentum after the bulls pushed Cardano ( ADA ) above the moving averages. The altcoin is currently attempting to rally to the overhead resistance at $0.1142241. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, the ADA/USD pair could remain range-bound between $0.0893 and $0.1142241 for a few days.  However, the flat moving averages and the RSI above 60 suggest that the bulls are attempting a comeback. If the buyers can push the price above $0.1142241, a rally to $0.128 and then to $0.1445 is possible. This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and plummets below $0.0893.  BSV/USD The bulls purchased Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) on dips to the $146.20 support on Nov. 3 and 4 as seen from the long tails on the candlesticks. The rebound picked momentum on Nov. 5 and the altcoin has currently risen above the moving averages. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can sustain the price above the moving averages, the BSV/USD pair could rally to $180.63. The bears may defend this level aggressively as the pair had reversed direction from this resistance on three previous occasions.  Both moving averages are flat and the RSI has risen to the midpoint, which suggests that the range-bound action is likely to continue for a few more days. Contrary to this assumption, a trending move could start if the bulls push and sustain the price above $180.63 or the bears sink the pair below the $146.20 to $135 support zone.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/9: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LINK, BNB, LTC, DOT, ADA, BSV  ","Professional traders are often perceived to be the smartest, as they weigh the risks before investing in an asset class. Opposite to that, most retail traders only keep an eye on the possible profits and disregard the risk before investing. Therefore, the increase in the number of Bitcoin ( BTC ) addresses holding more than 100 Bitcoin to a  seven-month high, at 16,271 , could be considered as a bullish sign. Furthermore, the low search volume for the keyword “Bitcoin” suggests that the current rally lacks the frenzied retail buying seen during the previous bull market in 2017.  Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 PlanB, the creator of the stock-to-flow model, has maintained his bullish stance on Bitcoin, as he  expects the price to at least rally to $100,000  by December 2021. If that happens, Bitcoin would command a market capitalization of about $2 trillion. While crypto analysts are voicing bullish forecasts for Bitcoin, noted economist and Bitcoin skeptic  Nouriel Roubini remains bearish , as he anticipates central bank digital currencies to start a big revolution in about three years. Thereafter, “Not only you don’t need crypto, you don’t even need Venmo,” said Roubini in a recent interview. In other news, U.S. equity markets surged higher on the positive news that Pfizer is  recording success in its COVID-19 vaccine trials . As the news broke, gold and Bitcoin prices corrected sharply, but it appears that crypto investors are viewing the dips as buying opportunities.  Let’s take a look at the top crypto assets to see how they are performing today. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) is in an uptrend but is currently facing stiff resistance near $16,000. The failure to rise above the overhead resistance could attract profit-booking from the short-term traders and shorting by the aggressive bears. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the BTC/USD pair breaks below $15,650, it could drop to the critical support at $14,000. The 20-day exponential moving average ($13,935) is placed just below this support; hence, the bulls are likely to defend this level aggressively. A strong bounce off the 20-day EMA will indicate accumulation by the bulls at lower levels. The price could remain stuck between $14,000 and $16,000 for a few days before starting the next trending move. If the bulls can push the price above $16,000, a rally to $17,200 and then to all-time highs is possible. Conversely, a break below the 20-day EMA could result in a fall to the 50-day simple moving average ($12,137). ETH/USD The bulls are struggling to push the price above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. Ether ( ETH ) formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Nov. 8 and is currently trading in a tight range. This suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears sink the price below $432, the possibility of a drop to the 20-day EMA ($409) increases. A break below the support line of the wedge will indicate an advantage to the bears. However, the upsloping 20-day EMA and the relative strength index in the positive zone suggest an advantage to the bulls. If they can push the price above the wedge, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $488.134.  A breakout of this resistance could resume the uptrend with the next target at $520 and then $550. XRP/USD XRP  attempted to break out of the range on Nov. 7 but the bears pushed the price right back in. The bulls are currently attempting to defend the moving averages. If they succeed, another attempt to push the price above $0.26 is likely. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price sustains above $0.26 for a day, the XRP/USD pair could start a new uptrend with the first target objective at $0.30. However, the flat moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the price slips below the moving averages, the pair could remain range-bound between $0.26 and $0.2295 for the next few days. A break below the $0.2295 to $0.219712 support zone will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) broke above $272 for the past two days but could not sustain the higher levels. The repeated price rejection shows that the bears are aggressively defending the $272–$280 resistance zone.  BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($257), the BCH/USD pair could drop to $242 and then to $231. Such a move will indicate the possibility of a range-bound action between $231 and $280 for a few days. However, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. If the bulls can push the price above the overhead resistance zone, a rally to $300 and then to $326.30 is possible.  LINK/USD The bulls tried to propel Chainlink's LINK above the $13.28 resistance on Nov. 7 but failed. However, the positive thing is that the altcoin bounced off the 20-day EMA ($11.46) and the bulls are again trying to push the price above the overhead resistance. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, it will complete a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $19.2731. The 20-day EMA ($11.46) has started to turn up gradually, and the RSI is in the positive territory, which suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. However, if the price again turns down from the overhead resistance, the bears will try to sink the LINK/USD pair below the moving averages. If they succeed, a drop to $9.7665 is possible. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) has been stuck between $32 and $25.6652 for the past few days. The bulls attempted to push the price above the moving averages on Nov. 7, but they failed. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28) and the RSI in negative territory suggest that bears have the upper hand. If the price sustains below the moving averages, a drop to $25.6652 is possible.  A bounce off this support could extend the stay inside the range for a few more days, while a break below it could start a new downtrend. This negative view will be invalidated if the BNB/USD pair turns up from the current levels and breaks above $30. Such a move could result in a rally to $32.  LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) once again turned down from the stiff overhead resistance of $64 on Nov. 7. Barring the breakout on Aug. 17, the price has turned down from this resistance on three occasions.  LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The RSI is forming a bearish divergence, which suggests that the momentum may be weakening.  If the LTC/USD pair turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($56), it will increase the possibility of a drop to the 50-day SMA ($50). On the other hand, if the pair rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $64. If they succeed, a rally to $68.9008 is possible. DOT/USD Polkadot's DOT is currently trading inside a small range that has resistance at $4.95 and support at $3.80. The price turned down from $4.8586 on Nov. 7, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bulls are trying to keep the price above the moving averages, and the RSI has also taken support at the 50 level. If the RSI can break out of the downtrend line, it will indicate an advantage to the bulls. If buyers can push the price above $4.95, a rally to $5.5899 is likely. The bears may again defend this level aggressively, but if the bulls can thrust the price above it, a new uptrend could begin. ADA/USD  Cardano's ADA turned down from the $0.1142241 resistance on Nov. 7, which shows that the bears are aggressively defending this level. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not allowed the price to dip below the moving averages. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The strong rebound off the moving averages on Nov. 8 shows that the sentiment is to buy the dips. The bulls will again attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance. If they can pull it off, the ADA/USD pair could rally to $0.128 and then to $0.1445. On the contrary, if the price again turns down from $0.1142241, then the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. A break below the moving averages will signal weakness, and the bears will then try to sink the pair below $0.0893. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV (BSV) continues to trade inside the broad range of $146 to $181. The price has been oscillating above and below the moving averages for the past three days, which shows that traders are undecided about the next move. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the halfway mark suggest a balance between supply and demand. If the price sustains below the moving averages, the bears will try to sink the BSV/USD pair to the critical support at $146. A rebound off this level could extend the range-bound action for a few more days. The trend will shift in favor of the bulls if they can push the price above the overhead resistance at $181.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/11: BTC, ETH, XRP, LINK, BCH, BNB, DOT, LTC, ADA, BSV ","Billionaire investor Stanley Druckenmiller became the latest famous name to  disclose a Bitcoin position . Although Druckenmiller did not specify the quantity he had purchased, he did say that Bitcoin will outperform gold a lot more “because it’s thinner, more illiquid, and has a lot more beta to it.” Paul Tudor Jones, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Bill Miller are some of the  most successful  traders and investors on Wall Street. A stamp of approval from them is likely to attract several other investors who may want to diversify their portfolio and outperform the markets. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 In further validation for the crypto space, controversial Australian politician Cory Bernardi has called Bitcoin ( BTC ) “the  millennial’s version of gold .” Even though Bernardi said that risks remain, he believes they are similar to that of any other asset class. Alex Saunders, founder of the crypto education site Nuggets News, views the endorsements for cryptocurrencies by high-profile figures as a sign of changing times and earlier this week the analyst predicted that Bitcoin price will reach $1 million by 2030.  These fundamental points are long-term positives for cryptocurrency prices. However, let’s analyze the charts of the top-10 cryptocurrencies to find out the path of least resistance in the short-term. BTC/USD Bitcoin ( BTC ) had formed an inside day candlestick pattern on Nov. 10, which showed indecision among the bulls and the bears. The uncertainty has been resolved to the upside today with the bulls attempting to push the price above the $16,000 resistance.  BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls succeed, the BTC/USD pair could start the journey towards the next target objective at $17,200. This level is likely to be the last stop before the pair retests the all-time highs. The rising moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought zone suggest that bulls are in command. Contrary to this assumption, if the price fails to sustain above $16,000, then the pair could remain range-bound between $14,000 and $16,000 for a few more days. A break below the 20-day exponential moving average ($14,242) will be the first sign of weakness. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) formed inside day candlestick patterns for three consecutive days from Nov. 8 to 10. This uncertainty has today resolved to the upside, which suggests that the bulls have absorbed the selling and have established their supremacy. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can sustain the price above the resistance line of the wedge, it will invalidate the bearish setup. That will open the gates for a retest of the critical overhead resistance at $488.134. A breakout and close above this level could resume the up-move. The first target on the upside is $520 and if the ETH/USD pair can ascend this level, a move to $550 is possible. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in command. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the 20-day EMA ($418), it will signal that the bears are aggressively defending the wedge. They will then try to pull the price down to the 50-day simple moving average at $382. XRP/USD The bulls pushed  XRP  above the overhead resistance at $0.26 on Nov.10 but failed to sustain the breakout. This suggests selling at higher levels, but the positive thing is that the bulls have not allowed the price to break below the moving averages on the downside. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Repeated jumps above a resistance level tend to weaken it. The bulls are currently again attempting to propel the XRP/USD pair above $0.26. If they succeed in sustaining the price above this level, a new uptrend is likely. The first target on the upside is $0.30. The RSI in the positive territory and the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($0.248) suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This positive view will be invalidated if the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. Such a move could drag the pair down to the support at $0.2295. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) has been trading close to the overhead resistance at $13.28 for the past few days. A tight consolidation near a resistance usually ends with a breakout favoring the bulls. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price closes above $13.28, it will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that may signal the start of a new up-move. The target objective of this setup is $19.2731.  The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest that bulls are in control. This bullish view will be invalidated if the price turns down sharply from the current levels. Such a move could result in profit-booking by short-term traders. A break below $9.7665 will signal a possible deeper correction to $7.30. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) is struggling to rebound off the 20-day EMA ($257). This suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at these levels as they may not be confident that the altcoin will rise above $280. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bearish divergence on the RSI also suggests that the momentum may be weakening. If the 20-day EMA support cracks, the BCH/USD pair could drop to the 50-day SMA ($245) and then to $231. This negative view will be invalidated if the pair rebounds off the current levels and breaks above the $272 to $280 resistance zone. The flattish 20-day EMA and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a range-bound action in the short-term. BNB/USD The intraday range in Binance Coin ( BNB ) is narrowing, which suggests indecision among the bulls and the bears. The flat moving averages and the RSI just below the midpoint also suggests a balance between the bulls and the bears. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the range expands to the upside and the bulls push the price above the moving averages and the overhead resistance at $30, the BNB/USD pair could rally to the $32 to $33.3888 zone. Conversely, if the range expansion happens to the downside, the bears will try to sink the pair below the $25.6652 support. The next trending move could start after the bulls push the price above $33.3888 or the bears sink the price below $25.6652. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) is currently stuck close to the midpoint of the $3.80 to $4.95 range. However, as long as the price sustains above the moving averages, the bulls will try to push the price to the resistance of the range. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA ($4.29) and the RSI in the positive zone suggest a marginal advantage to the bulls. A break above $4.95 could push the price to the next resistance at $5.5899. Conversely, if the price again turns down from $4.95, the DOT/USD pair may remain range-bound for a few more days. A break below the moving averages will be the first sign that the bulls have surrendered the advantage to the bears. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has bounced off the 20-day EMA ($56.75), which suggests that the sentiment remains positive and the bulls are buying on dips. The bulls will now try to push the price to the overhead resistance at $64.  LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Traders can keep an eye on the RSI as it has formed a symmetrical triangle. A breakout of the triangle will increase the possibility of a break above $64 while a break below the triangle could pull the price below the 20-day EMA. Currently, the upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This advantage could shift in favor of the bears if the support at $56.50 gives way. Such a move could drag the LTC/USD pair to $51. ADA/USD  Cardano ( ADA ) has been sustaining above the moving averages for the past few days. The bulls are now likely to attempt to push the price above the overhead resistance at $0.1142241. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, the ADA/USD pair will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.1391. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from $0.1142241, the pair may remain range-bound for a few more days.  The advantage will tilt in favor of the bears if the price reverses direction and breaks below the moving averages. If that happens, the pair could drop to the critical support at $0.0893. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) remains range-bound but the failure of the bulls to push the price above the moving averages suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. The bears will now try to sink the price to the critical support at $146. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both the moving averages are flat and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a balance between supply and demand. Even if the BSV/USD pair dips to $146, the bulls are likely to defend this level. A strong bounce off the support of the range could extend the stay inside the range. Contrary to this assumption, if the BSV/USD pair turns up from the current levels and breaks above the downtrend line, then it can move up to $181.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/13: BTC, ETH, XRP, LINK, BCH, LTC, BNB, DOT, ADA, BSV  ","Data shows that Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current rally is supported by greater participation from retail and institutional investors. The CME Bitcoin futures open interest has moved closer to the previous all-time high, a sign that institutional investors are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies. Similarly, Bitcoin’s spot  volume has hit a new 52-week high, according to data from Arcane research .  However, during strong uptrends, traders tend to get greedy and take on excessive  leverage . Hence, large open interest on derivatives could act as a double-edged sword because even a small decline in Bitcoin could force the highly leveraged traders to close their positions. Such a move could have a cascading effect that could lead to long liquidation. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 While traders should be cautious, there is no need to panic as yet because the current up-move in Bitcoin has happened without any euphoria or frenzy, especially among retail traders.  Moreover, several analysts have been skeptical of the rally, which is another positive sign. The top usually forms when the last bear in the market turns bullish and there is no one left to buy. This does not mean that there will be no corrections along the way. Pullbacks are necessary to periodically shake out the weak hands and this generally improves the longevity of the trend. Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to ascertain whether the uptrend will continue or is a correction around the corner. BTC/USD The bulls pushed Bitcoin ( BTC ) above the $16,000 overhead resistance on Nov. 12. This breakout started the next leg of the uptrend that may carry the price to the critical overhead resistance at $17,200. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The upsloping moving averages and the relative strength index in the overbought territory suggest that the bulls are in command. If the momentum can carry the price above $17,200, then the bulls will have a clear shot at the all-time highs.  However, traders can get cautious if the pair turns down from the current levels and drops below $16,000 once again. This will suggest that the market participants have rejected higher levels. If the price sustains below $16,000, the bears will try to sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day exponential moving average ($14,596). Such a move will indicate that bulls are not buying the dips as the sentiment has turned negative. ETH/USD The bulls are finding it difficult to propel Ether ( ETH ) above the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls will again attempt to thrust the price above the wedge. If they can do that, the ETH/USD pair may rise to $488.134. The bears may again try to stall the up-move at this resistance. If they succeed, a drop to the 20-day EMA ($426) is possible. Conversely, if the bulls can push the price above $488.134, the next leg of the uptrend is likely to begin. The first target on the upside is $520 and then $550. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 67 suggest that bears are in command. The first sign of weakness will be a break below the 20-day EMA. Such a move could result in a drop to the support line of the wedge.  XRP/USD XRP  has been consolidating near the $0.26 overhead resistance for the past two days. This suggests that the bulls are not closing their positions in a hurry as they expect the price to break above the range. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The rising moving averages and the RSI above 59 suggest that bulls are in control. A breakout and close above $0.26 could start the journey to $0.30. Above this level, the up-move may reach $0.326113. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls again fail to sustain the price above $0.26, then the bears will try to pull the price back below the moving averages. If they succeed, the XRP/USD pair may drop to $0.2295. LINK/USD The bulls failed to push and sustain Chainlink ( LINK ) above $13.28 on Nov. 11. This shows that the bears are aggressively defending this resistance. However, the positive thing is that the bulls have not given up much ground in the past two days. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bulls are currently attempting to drive the price above $13.28. If they manage to do that, the LINK/USD pair will complete an inverse head and shoulders pattern that has a target objective of $19.2731. Both moving averages are sloping up and the RSI has risen above 58. This suggests a minor advantage to the bulls. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair turns down from $13.28 once again, the bears will try to pull the price down to $9.7665. A break below this support will invalidate the bullish pattern. BCH/USD The bulls purchased the dip below the 20-day EMA ($257) on Nov. 12 but could not sustain the higher levels. This has attracted selling by the bears and Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) has broken below the 20-day EMA. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bears sink the price below the 50-day simple moving average ($247), the BCH/USD pair could drop to the next support at $231. The bulls have defended this support on two previous occasions, hence, a break below it may intensify selling and drag the price to $200. However, the 20-day EMA is flat and the RSI is close to the midpoint, which suggests a few more days of range-bound action. The momentum could pick up if the bulls push the price above $280 or the bears sink the price below $231.  LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has surged above the $64 resistance today, which shows that the bulls have overpowered the bears. The buyers will now try to sustain the momentum and drive the price above $68.9008. LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next target is $80 and then a rally to $100 is possible. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 67 suggest bulls are in charge. Contrary to this assumption, if the price again turns down from the current levels and plummets below $64, it will suggest a lack of buyers at higher levels. Such a move could attract profit booking that may result in a drop to the 20-day EMA ($57.86). BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) is currently stuck in a tight range between $28.97 and $27.30. The altcoin bounced off the support of this range on Nov. 12 and the bulls will now try to push the price above the moving averages. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, the BNB/USD pair could rise to $30 and a break above this resistance may open the gates for a rally to $32. However, the downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI just below the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bears.  If the price turns down from the current levels and breaks below $27.30, the pair may drop to $25.6652. A break below this support will signal weakness. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) turned down from $4.63 on Nov. 11 and the bears attempted to sink the price below the 20-day EMA ($4.31) on Nov. 12 but failed. This shows that bulls are defending the moving averages.  DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA is rising gradually and the RSI is above 55, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. However, the buyers will have to sustain the price above the immediate resistance at $4.50 to increase the possibility of a move to $4.95. Contrary to this assumption, if the DOT/USD pair again turns down from $4.50 or $4.63, the bears will try to sink the price below the moving averages. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the $3.80 support. ADA/USD  After the bulls failed to push Cardano ( ADA ) higher on Nov. 10 and 11, the bears tried to sink the price below the moving averages on Nov. 12 but could not. The altcoin has currently rebounded off the 20-day EMA ($0.102) and the bulls are attempting to push the price to $0.1142241. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The moving averages are rising and the RSI is in the positive zone, suggesting an advantage to the bulls. The ADA/USD pair could pick up momentum after the bulls push the price above $0.1142241. However, if the pair turns down from the current levels and plunges below the moving averages, the bears will try to pull the price down to the $0.0893 support.  The next trending move may start after the bulls push the price above $0.1142241 or the bears sink the price below $0.0893. BSV/USD The bulls have failed to propel Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) above the 20-day EMA ($162) in the past three days. This suggests a lack of urgency among the bulls to buy at the current levels. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, which suggests a minor advantage to the bears.  If the sellers can sink the price below the immediate support at $154.66, the BSV/USD pair could drop to the $146 support. This negative view will be invalidated if the bulls can push the price above the moving averages and the downtrend line. Such a move will increase the possibility of a rally to $181.

binance,Tech,New MIT Paper Roundly Rejects Blockchain Voting as Solution to Election Woes,"As media outlets waited to announce a winner until the Saturday following the U.S. presidential election, calls for how blockchains would have made this process easier emerged,  most prominently  perhaps by  Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance,  as well as Vitalik Buterin , who added that, though there are technical challenges, the call for a blockchain-based, mobile voting app “is directionally 100% correct.” A  new report from MIT , however, strongly argues against the idea of blockchain-based e-voting, largely on the basis that it will increase cybersecurity vulnerabilities that already exist, it fails meet the unique needs of voting in political elections and it adds more issues than it fixes.  The report's authors are Ron Rivest, MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) professor and one of the creators of RSA encryption; Michael Specter; Sunoo Park; and Director of MIT’s  Digital Currency Initiative  (DCI) Neha Narula. The paper was published on the research team's website this week and is being reviewed by a major cybersecurity journal for publication this winter..  “I haven't yet seen a blockchain system that I would trust with a county-fair jellybean count, much less a presidential election,"" said Rivest in a blog post accompanying the report.  Why online voting isn’t like digital banking The report recognizes the desire for people to want the voting process to be faster and more efficient, but pushes back on the idea that just because we do things like shop or bank online, that means elections should be done in the same way.  One reason is that those systems have “higher tolerances for failure.” For example, if an issue were to occur, such as credit card fraud, you could block your card and a bank might even reimburse you. But when it comes to election, there is little remedy if a vote is altered or not delivered, particularly given that online voting systems might not always recognize when one of these actions occurred.  Read more:  Overstock Touts Voatz ReBlockchain Voting App as Solution to US Election Fracas Another is that anonymity, or at least detaching the way you voted from your identity, is an important part of any electoral process. While a bank or shop can offer you a receipt, proving you did something to detect or prevent fraud, with voting, it’s important no such receipt exists so votes can’t be coerced or sold.  “For elections there is no insurance or recourse against a failure of democracy,” Rivest says. “There is no means to ‘make voters whole again’ after a compromised election.” And the cybersecurity issues are numerous.  Issues with cybersecurity in online voting One issue with online voting is that it opens itself up to attacks that are both scalable and undetectable.  In terms of scale, according to the report, a zero-day Android vulnerability only cost $60,000 to acquire in 2012. A zero-day vulnerability is a security flaw that is known about but for which a patch isn’t yet available.  The authors estimate that testing and weaponizing such a vulnerability would increase the associated costs by two orders of magnitude, meaning an election exploit could cost $6 million. While that may seem like a large sum, it’s little for a nation-state adversary, especially in comparison with the roughly $768 million that was spent on the 2016 U.S. presidential election. This makes a scalable attack on an election system attractive, in terms of getting a bang for your buck.  Such an attack could also be undetectable, resulting in large numbers of votes being exploited. This is, in part, due to the number of vendors and devices that would have to be involved.  “Voting system flaws might be introduced by the voting software vendor, the hardware vendor, the manufacturer or any third party that maintains or supplies code for these organizations,” reads the report.  “A voter using a phone to vote depends not only on the phone vendor, but on the hardware companies providing drivers for the device, the baseband processor, the authors of third-party code in the voting software, the manufacturer of the physical device and the network or any other systems that the device relies upon to cast the vote.” No concrete solutions to non-hypothetical problems Even important tools like encryption don’t offer a concrete solution. While encryption does offer some protections, it doesn’t prevent system bugs. Plus, implementing it is difficult, not to mention there are numerous examples of flaws in a system allowing cryptographic protocols to become compromised.  These concerns aren’t just hypotheticals. The report notes that  electronic-only voting devices at polling stations used in Georgia and Maryland, for example, have  previously been shown to be vulnerable , and internet voting systems in  cities like Washington, D.C ., and countries including Estonia and Switzerland were found to be vulnerable to serious failures.  Read more:  Downvoted: Security Researchers Slam Voatz Over Stance on White-Hat Hackers For comparison, tried-and-true methods such as mail-in ballots make a large-scale attack on them incredibly difficult to conduct with any ease because of substantial friction points, like needing physical access to the ballots.  When asked whether there were lessons the U.S. could take from other countries when it comes to voting online, an MIT CSAIL spokesperson said, “None that are positive. Online voting systems will suffer from major vulnerabilities for the foreseeable future, given the state of computer security and the high stakes in political elections.” The arguments for blockchain-based voting – and why they don’t hold up The report lays out a number of arguments that have been held up by blockchain proponents. These include using coins as votes, using a permissioned blockchain and employing zero-knowledge proofs for secret ballots.  Voting with coins Coins as votes is one model the report identifies as problematic. In it, a registered voter has a public/private key pair created by the voting authority, with each voter sending their public key to the voting registry.  “Then, the voter registry spends one coin to each public key. To vote, each user spends their coin to the candidate of their choice. After a period, everyone can look at the blockchain, total up each candidate's coins, and select the one with the most coins as the winner,” reads the report.  Read more:  Trump’s Post-Election Purge Reaches US Cybersecurity Agency The issue here is that it doesn’t provide a secret ballot – all the votes are on a public blockchain. It also relies on users being able to get their votes on the blockchain in a certain amount of time, something that could be compromised through distributed denial-of-service attack, making the network unavailable to users.  An adversary could drive up transaction fees on a public blockchain, further hampering the “vote.” Or the blockchain could be compromised if a majority of the miners or validators collude, creating multiple versions of the blockchain.  Finally, it relies on private key management, something that is user-dependent and, as cryptocurrencies have shown, something people are often bad at implementing.  Permissioned blockchains Another proposal the report challenges is using a permissioned blockchain. A permissioned blockchain is one in which a central actor approves who can be a part of it. There is also usually a control layer that governs what actions participants have permission to perform. Like voting with coins, use of this strategy would still suffer from key management vulnerabilities. Furthermore, permission parameters would also keep users from reading the blockchain to verify their votes were counted in order to preserve the secrecy of people’s votes.  A permissioned blockchain would also likely run on a smaller number of servers, with most of them running the same operating system, meaning it would be easier to compromise.  Zero-knowledge proofs A final proposal that MIT examines is the use of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). ZKPs are a cryptographic technique that allows two parties on the internet, such as an app and a user, to verify information with each other without sharing the underlying data related to this information. This would seemingly help ease the tension between secrecy and making a vote publicly verifiable.  But the report notes that, aside from the potential bugs in ZKPs and challenging cryptographic processes, it also doesn’t prevent physical monitoring by “coercers or vote buyers.”  Additionally, the report argues that “zero-knowledge proofs are designed for a setting where the party with secret information wants to keep it secret (that's why they're using zero-knowledge proofs) - they generally do not prevent that party from revealing information voluntarily.” Read more:  ‘Snake Oil and Overpriced Junk’: Why Blockchain Doesn’t Fix Online Voting A final and fundamental concern about any digital processes such as these, however, is that they rely on various vendors, hardware and software, all of which add additional complexities and likely vulnerabilities to the voting process.  “The biggest issue is that blockchain-based approaches require that voters use software in which a single bug could undetectably change what they see - for example, showing them that their vote was cast for a certain candidate when it actually wasn’t,” said a MIT CSAIL spokesperson.  “Blockchain is ripe for situations where election results could be changed in ways that are undetectable, or, even if detected, would be irreparable without running an entire new election.” The report also plays up that elections have stakes beyond just losing money, as would be the case if these online voting tools were compromised in regards to cryptocurrencies.  Blockchain has lots of potential, just not for actual voting The report notes it isn't addressing voting within a blockchain, such as EOS holders voting for validators in consensus networks, or Augur users using REP to vote on contract outcomes. These may fulfill some aspects of voting, but don’t map onto the system of political elections well, and leave many vulnerabilities that can't be accounted for.  The report also recognizes it’s focusing on voting, not areas such as voter registration management or auditing.  In conclusion, the report notes that blockchain and online voting don’t address fundamental security concerns; instead, they introduce more vulnerabilities than are present in current in-person and mail-in ballot systems.  “If vote-casting is entirely software-based, a malicious system could fool the voter about how the vote was actually recorded,” said Rivest in an accompanying blog. “Democracy – and the consent of the governed – cannot be made contingent on whether some software correctly recorded voters’ choices.”",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2020/11/16/new-mit-paper-roundly-rejects-blockchain-voting-as-solution-to-election-woes/,coindesk,2020-11-16,05:01:00,en,1712,10843,5.3078271028037385,690,0.4030373831775701,medium

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/16: BTC, ETH, XRP, LINK, BCH, LTC, BNB, DOT, ADA, BSV  ","As Bitcoin ( BTC ) continues to rally to a new 2020 high above $16,700, traders are pondering whether this is the start of a new bull market.  Mike McGlone, senior commodities strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence, believes that the main hurdle is at the all-time high near $20,000. Once that is crossed, Bitcoin could reach a  $1 trillion market capitalization . McGlone anticipates the uptrend to continue in 2021, and there are a growing number of analysts who agree with his view. Veteran trader Peter Brandt also believes that if previous bull runs are considered, Bitcoin is in the early stages of its next bull cycle. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 In another bullish projection, Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick believes that Bitcoin could  rally to $318,000 by December 2021 . Fitzpatrick arrived at this forecast by considering the previous bull markets in Bitcoin.  Every bull phase witnesses considerable corrections on the way up, and these provide opportunities for traders to sell high and buy again during dips. However, in order to do this, traders have to time their trades, otherwise they may miss out on the move. Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot any bearish or bullish setups that could project the next possible move.  BTC/USD In a strong uptrend, corrections usually do not last more than three days. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s rally that started in early October. The bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $16,500 and resumed the upward move. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The BTC/USD pair could now rally to the next significant resistance at $17,200. Here again, the bulls may have to overcome strong selling by the bears because once the buyers clear this resistance, there is no major hurdle until the all-time highs. The rising moving averages and the relative strength index in overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control. There is no negative formation on the chart that warns of a possible top at the current juncture. Still, traders should be careful and not get carried away with strength. They can keep a close eye on the 20-day exponential moving average ($15,032) because a break below it will be the first sign of weakness. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) has been facing selling pressure at the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. This line has now reached close to the overhead resistance at $488.134. Hence, the bears are likely to mount a strong defense of this level. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the price turns down from the overhead resistance and the bulls do not give up much ground, then it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $488.134. Above this level, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $520 and then to $550. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($435).  XRP/USD XRP  broke and closed above the $0.26 resistance on Nov. 13. Although the bears sold the rallies on Nov. 14 and 15, they could not pull the price back below the breakout level of $0.26.  XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView This shows that the sentiment has turned positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips. The 20-day EMA ($0.256) has turned up, and the RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside. The first target on the upside is $0.303746 and if this level is scaled, the XRP/USD pair could retest the $0.326113 resistance. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plummets below the $0.26 support.  LINK/USD Chainlink's LINK is currently attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($12). The bulls will now again try to propel the price above the $13.28 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin will complete an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The target objective of this bullish setup is $19.2731. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bulls. Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($11). A break below $9.7665 will invalidate the bullish setup. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) once again turned down from the overhead resistance zone of $272 to $280 on Nov. 15. This shows that the bears are defending this level aggressively. If the bears can sink the price below the immediate support at $242, a drop to $231 is possible. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The 20-day EMA ($256) is flat, while the 50-day SMA ($249) is moving up, and the RSI has been trading between 40 and 60 levels. This suggests a balance between supply and demand. Trading inside a range can be volatile and difficult to predict. Hence, it is better to trade when the price reaches the support or resistance of the range. Another possibility is to wait for the price to break above or below the range before taking large bets. If the bulls can push the price above $280, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $326.30. Conversely, a drop below $231 may sink the price to $200. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) has soared and broken out of the overhead resistance at $68.9008. If the bulls can sustain the price above the breakout level, it will signal the possible start of a new uptrend. The next target on the upside is $80, then $100.  LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to fake the current breakout and pull the price back below $68.9008. If they succeed, it will suggest strong selling close to the $70 mark. If the price sustains below $68.9008, the bears will then try to drag the LTC/USD pair down to the $64 support. If they can do that, it will suggest that the upward momentum has weakened.  BNB/USD The bears are trying to sink Binance Coin ( BNB ) below the tight range of $27.30 to $28.97. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28.29) and the RSI below 47 suggest an advantage to the bears. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the BNB/USD pair dips below $27.30, the next stop could be $25.6652. This is an important support, as the bulls have defended it aggressively on two previous occasions.  A strong rebound of this support will increase the possibility that the pair may consolidate in the $25.6652–$32 range for a few more days. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price above $28.97. If they succeed, a rally to $30 and then to $32 will be on the cards. DOT/USD Polkadot's DOT bounced off the 20-day EMA ($4.36) on Nov. 12, but the bulls could not push the price above the minor resistance at $4.63. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the bulls have again purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA and are currently attempting to push the price above the immediate resistance at $4.63. If they manage to do that, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $4.95. The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls.  This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to $3.80 is possible. ADA/USD  Cardano's ADA slipped below the moving averages on Nov. 15, but the bulls are trying to defend the support at $0.098822. If the altcoin rebounds and rises above the moving averages, the bulls will again try to push the price to $0.1142241. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView A breakout and close above the downtrend line will be the first sign of strength. Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below $0.098822, it could drop to $0.0893. As the bulls had purchased the previous two declines to $0.0893, they are likely to attempt it again. Hence, a bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the range.  The flat moving averages and the RSI near the halfway mark also point to a range-bound action for the next few days. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV (BSV) again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($161) on Nov. 14, which suggests that the bears are selling on minor rallies.

Source:  TradingView The downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 49 suggest a minor advantage to the bears. However, one positive development is the bullish divergence on the RSI. This suggests that the downside momentum may be weakening. If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it could clear the path for a rally to $181.

binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 11/18: BTC, ETH, XRP, LINK, LTC, BCH, DOT, BNB, ADA, BSV  ","Within the last 24-hours, Bitcoin ( BTC ) price hit an intraday high of $18,466.14 and this is just roughly 8% lower than the magical $20,000 figure being watched by many traders.  However, investors in several countries such as Russia, Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico have already seen their Bitcoin holdings hit a  new all-time high  in their local currency. Even Bitcoin’s  market capitalization  has hit a new record high, topping the high created in December 2017. With institutional investors finally arriving in herds, it seems it is only a matter of time before Bitcoin finally overtakes $20,000 and sets a new all-time high. Adding to the list of high profile billionaire’s acquiring Bitcoin, Ricardo Salinas Pliego, Mexico’s second-richest man, recently announced that he had invested in the digital asset. Accordion to Pliego,  10% of his liquid  assets are held in Bitcoin. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 Even existing investors have added to their holdings. Galaxy Digital chairman and CEO Mike Novogratz recently said that he had  purchased more  Bitcoin at $15,800 as he expects a rally to $65,000. Novogratz believes that “the network effect has taken over” and with “tons of new buyers” coming in, the limited supply will not be enough. The steady institutional inflow has resulted in Grayscale Investments Bitcoin holdings surging to over  500,000 Bitcoin . An annual survey from the company revealed that about 38% of the respondents have bought Bitcoin in the  past four months . 63% of these investors said that the coronavirus pandemic was the main factor that influenced their decision to purchase Bitcoin. After today’s spectacular rally, many investors are searching for hints on whether Bitcoin will continue its uptrend or correct sharply from the current levels.  Let’s analyze the top-10 cryptocurrencies to see what the charts project. BTC/USD Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) momentum was very strong in the past two days and while many investors believed that $17,200 would serve as a major resistance, the price sliced right through it with ease.  However, the cryptocurrency has been running hard since early October and it may soon tire out if it keeps proceeding at the current pace. BTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If it takes a break to regroup and then resume the uptrend, this would be a positive as it would all the current rally to have longer staying power. The price has currently formed a Doji candlestick and this shows there is indecision among the bulls and the bears. If the price corrects to the 20-day exponential moving average ($15,528), placed just above the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level, it may be considered a healthy sign. Even if the price does not correct, a range-bound action between $16,500 and $18,500 will be positive. Contrary to this assumption, if the momentum drives the BTC/USD pair to new highs without any pullback, then the possibility of the record highs sustaining will be lowered. At that time, a correction could be vicious as there is no major support until $12,500. The relative strength index (RSI) has been trading between 70 and 84 for about a month, which shows that the trend is strong but also overextended. Hence, at the risk of missing out on some part of the rally, traders should keep their greed in check and trade with suitable stop losses. ETH/USD Ether ( ETH ) inched above the overhead resistance at $488.134 today but the bulls could not sustain the breakout. This shows that the bears are defending the overhead resistance aggressively. ETH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, if the bulls do not allow the price to dip below the 20-day EMA ($442), it will suggest accumulation at lower levels. If the price consolidates near the overhead resistance, it will increase the possibility of a break above it. If the ETH/USD pair sustains above $488.134, the rally could extend to $520 and then to $550.  On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 50-day simple moving average ($399) will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.  XRP/USD XRP  reached its first target objective at $0.303746 on Nov. 17 and short-term traders seem to have booked profits at this level as seen from the sharp correction today. However, the bulls are trying to arrest the decline at the 50% Fibonacci retracement level of $0.278123. XRP/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If they succeed, then another attempt to push the price above the $0.308176 resistance is likely. The next level where the bears may again launch a stiff resistance is $0.326113. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI near overbought territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand. Contrary to this assumption, if the XRP/USD pair dips below $0.278123, a decline to the 20-day EMA ($0.264) is likely. LINK/USD Chainlink ( LINK ) broke above the $13.28 overhead resistance on Nov. 17 but the bulls are struggling to sustain the breakout. This suggests that the bears are attempting to sink the price back below the breakout level. LINK/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the LINK/USD pair breaks and sustains below the 20-day EMA ($12.26), it will invalidate the bullish inverse head and shoulders pattern. Conversely, if the bulls manage to sustain the price above the breakout level of $13.28, the pair could start its journey towards the target objective of $19.2731. The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 59 suggest that bulls are in command. LTC/USD Litecoin ( LTC ) is currently witnessing a pullback in an uptrend but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at the breakout level of $68.9008. This suggests that the bulls have managed to flip $68.9008 as support. This level may now act as a floor during future declines.  LTC/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The rising moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone suggest that the bulls are in control. They will now attempt to push the price above the $77.20 resistance and resume the uptrend. If they succeed, the LTC/USD pair could rally to $100.  On the contrary, if the bears sink the price below the immediate support at $68.9008, it will suggest that the momentum has weakened. A break below the 20-day EMA ($62.92) could signal that the bears have made a strong comeback. BCH/USD Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) continues to face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA ($255). This is a negative sign as it suggests that the bulls are not able to absorb the selling by the bears and push the price higher. BCH/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The price has broken below the moving averages and the bears will now try to sink the BCH/USD pair below the immediate support at $242. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the $231 support. A break below $231 will increase the likelihood of a fall to $200 but if the pair rebounds off $231, the range-bound action may continue for a few more days. The flat moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory suggest a minor advantage to the bears. DOT/USD Polkadot ( DOT ) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($4.41) on Nov. 16 and reached the overhead resistance at $4.95 on Nov. 17. The bears are currently trying to defend the resistance and keep the altcoin range-bound for a few more days. DOT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, the gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in positive territory suggest that bulls have the upper hand.  If the price rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the buyers may once again attempt to clear the hurdle at $4.95. If they can do that, the DOT/USD pair could move up to $5.5899. Contrary to this assumption, if the pair breaks below the moving averages, the range-bound action between $3.80 and $4.95 could continue for a few more days. BNB/USD The bulls failed to propel Binance Coin ( BNB ) above the $27.30 to $28.97 range today as the price turned down from the overhead resistance. This suggests that buying dries up at higher levels. BNB/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, this tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long. Soon, the BNB/USD pair will either break above or below the range. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout because the indicators are suggesting a balance between supply and demand. Therefore, it is better to wait for the price to escape the range before placing large bets. If the bulls push the price above the range, a rally to $32 is possible. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below $27.30, the pair could retest the critical support at $25.6652. ADA/USD  The bulls pushed Cardano ( ADA ) above the downtrend line on Nov. 17 but they have not been able to clear the hurdle at $0.1142241. This suggests that the bears are defending this overhead resistance. ADA/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView However, if the ADA/USD pair does not dip back below the downtrend line, the bulls will once again try to propel the price above the overhead resistance. If they manage to do that, the pair will complete a double bottom pattern that has a target objective of $0.1391. If the RSI breaks and sustains above 60, it could signal a possible pick up in momentum that could result in a break above $0.1142241. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair breaks below the $0.098822 support. BSV/USD Bitcoin SV ( BSV ) rallied above the downtrend line on Nov. 17 but the bulls have not been able to sustain the momentum. This suggests that traders are closing their positions even on minor rallies. BSV/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The bears are currently trying to sink the BSV/USD pair back below the downtrend line, while the bulls are attempting to achieve a close above it. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to the midpoint does not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. A close above the downtrend line could increase the possibility of a rally to $181 while a close below the line may result in a drop to $146. The next trending move could start after the pair breaks above or below the $181 to $146 range.

binance, News ," DeFi boom drives 1,200% increase in DApp volume in 2020: Report ","DApp transaction volume has topped $270 billion so far in 2020, with 95% of this figure belonging to Ethereum’s DeFi ecosystem, according to DappRadar. That’s an astonishing 1178% increase from last year’s total of $21 billion. The blockchain data provider revealed the figures in its annual  DApp Industry Report  today, summarizing the highlights and failures of a record-breaking year for DApp-based economics.  The report noted that money has been flowing from BTC to ETH throughout the year, resulting in a rise in the price of ETH, from 0.018 BTC on Jan 1. 2020 to its current price of 0.028 BTC.  DappRadar speculates that attractive yields in DeFi were the “main trigger of Bitcoin flowing to Ethereum,” with  Wrapped Bitcoin  (wBTC) and  RenVM’s renBTC  playing crucial roles in tapping Bitcoin’s vast reserves of liquidity for DApps. 2020 was a record year for the  #blockchain  industry: Dapp transaction volumes surpassed $270B with 95% accounted for by  #Ethereum ’s DeFi ecosystem. #NFT  marketplaces demonstrated their potential with multiple sales worth more than $100,000. Read more⬇️ https://t.co/Y4ya8qiIPO — DappRadar (@DappRadar)  December 17, 2020 
 
 Describing 2020 as the “year that DApps tried to grow at all costs,” the report found that just 10 DeFi DApps accounted for 87% of Ethereum’s total transaction volume. Those 10 DApps  totaled over one million active users  in November, with the top three — DeFi Swap (Crypto.com), Uniswap, and Compound — dominating the total with 930,000 between them.  The report noted that the limitations of Ethereum became apparent this year as the network “effectively hit a wall in regards to scalability” with average gas prices several times higher than last year.  Congestion on the network accelerated the rise of competitors during the second half of the year, with DApp-friendly platforms like Binance Smart Chain, Tron, and Wax accounting for a rapidly increasing share of total DApp transaction value. Also on the rise is the severity of hacks and exploits of unaudited or improperly audited smart contracts used by DeFi projects. DappRadar estimates that more than $120 million was stolen across 12 major incidents in 2020. It predicted that ""insurance will be the next important DeFi ecosystem subcategory,” as a result. While it’s garnered a lot of attention lately the “NFT Marketplaces” category exhibited only moderate growth across the year. The “Games” category remained flat and the “Gambling” category ended slightly down. The DappRadar report concluded that COVID-19 has actually served to strengthen DApp ecosystems by encouraging their use as problem-solving measures: “It would appear the global pandemic brought increased attention to decentralized solutions as conversations deepened around the distribution of a basic universal income and worldwide database management systems.” Looking forward, DappRadar predicted that DeFi will play “an even more influential role” in 2021 and “form the foundation of the crypto economy” across all sectors, including NFTs, games, logistics, and other DApp categories.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/defi-boom-drives-1200-increase-in-dapp-volume-in-2020-report,cointelegraph,2020-12-18,00:00:00,en,473,3093,5.496828752642706,159,0.3361522198731501,dapp transaction volume topped figure belonging ethereum defi ecosystem dappradar astonishing increase total blockchain data provider revealed figure dapp industry report today summarizing highlight failure record breaking dapp based economics report noted flowing btc eth resulting rise eth btc current btc dappradar speculates attractive yield defi trigger bitcoin flowing ethereum wrapped bitcoin wbtc renvm renbtc playing crucial role tapping bitcoin vast reserve liquidity dapps record blockchain industry dapp transaction volume surpassed accounted ethereum defi ecosystem nft marketplace demonstrated potential multiple http ya qiipo dappradar dappradar describing dapps cost report found defi dapps accounted ethereum total transaction volume dapps totaled active user top defi swap crypto uniswap compound dominating total report noted limitation ethereum apparent network effectively hit scalability average gas price time higher congestion network accelerated rise competitor half dapp friendly platform binance chain tron wax accounting rapidly increasing share total dapp transaction rise severity hack exploit unaudited improperly audited contract defi project dappradar estimate stolen incident predicted insurance important defi ecosystem subcategory result garnered lot attention nft marketplace category exhibited moderate growth game category remained flat gambling category ended slightly dappradar report concluded covid served strengthen dapp ecosystem encouraging problem solving measure global pandemic brought increased attention decentralized solution conversation deepened distribution basic universal income worldwide database management system forward dappradar predicted defi play influential role form foundation crypto economy sector including nfts game logistics dapp category,0.05919540229885059,positive,0.5321839080459769,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.774, 'pos': 0.169, 'compound': 0.9761}",0.9761,0.057,0.774,0.169,positive,-0.15789472853185638,0.08636363597107438,negative
binance, Altcoin Watch , Binance Coin (BNB) hits a new all-time high one day before its token burn ,"Over the past 6 months, Binance Coin (BNB) has been quietly rallying higher, gaining 189% during this period and notching a new all-time high at $46.90 on Jan. 18. This price peak happened just one day before its quarterly token burn, leading investors to question whether or not BNB price will move higher once the event concludes.  A  token burn is a permanent removal of coins  from circulation and this deflationary technique is a common practice used by many projects in the crypto sector. As Cointelegraph reported, the process does not destroy the coins but rather renders them unusable. Aside from the supply change, Binance Chain recently launched smart contract capabilities which allow Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications and cross-chain asset swaps to join. The exchange has also been wildly profitable since launch so al of these factors provide good reason for BNB’s appreciation. BNB/USDT price (Binance). Source: TradingView When Binance Futures rolled out, the exchange announced that  futures platform revenue would be included in its BNB quarterly burn . These coins taken out of circulation will reflect a percentage of Binance’s earnings for the latest quarter of 2020. Despite being the absolute market leader on futures contracts, the ever-growing exchange launched this service fairly recently. Over the 16 months since inception, the platform has grown to a $4 billion open interest. This number surpasses more established derivatives exchanges like OKEx, Huobi and BitMEX. Initially, Binance stated that it would repurchase the coins slated for destruction, but this policy  changed in February 2019 . Thus, the actual token burn process involves reducing the potential supply until it reaches the 100 billion goal. The latest BNB burning round occurred on Oct. 16, 2020, and it involved a total of 2.25 million BNB. Although its reported supply stands at 142.41 million, Messari calculates a 108.35 million liquid supply. This difference comes from coins currently restricted or vested, meaning they are not actually being traded. Binance Chain’s evolution After launching staking and validation services in September 2020, Binance Smart Chain quickly started gaining traction. The network adds Ethereum compatible smart contracts capacity to the original Binance Chain. Shortly after launching, a host of decentralized applications started to emerge, totaling 60 projects and 600,000 unique smart chain addresses. Furthermore, 3 million BNB have been staked by network validators. To date, cross-chain assets to Binance Chain have surpassed $250 million, and a $100 million accelerator fund was created to attract decentralized finance applications.  Binance Launchpad is also another positive factor that supports BNB’s value. The platform hosts Binance’s Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) and in 2020 six successful token sales occurred. BNB Twitter user activity vs. market capitalization (USD). Source:  TheTie Data from TheTie, an alternative social analytics platform, shows that the recent price spike was accompanied by a sharp increase in Twitter user activity. Although this is not a fundamental factor, data shows that the more attention a token gets on social media, the easier it becomes to gather additional buying pressure. Many investors believe that token burns positively impact price as the supply is constricted and this supposedly incentivizes investors to hold their tokens rather than market sell them at each top.  Interestingly, the latest burn had little to no impact on BNB price. This situation could indicate that the market is evolving to price in these events ahead of the announcement date.  On the other hand, investors may have perceived a non-circulating token burn as a non-event. Therefore, those recently buying BNB with the expectation of a post-burn pump may be sorely disappointed.

binance,Tech,Privacy Coin Firo in Midst of 'Hash War' With 51% Attacker,"Firo (formerly known as Zcoin) has  experienced a 51% attack  and is now in the throes of a hash war. Firo recommends users not make transactions at this time, and said it is working with exchanges and pools to mitigate the damage. The team has also asked that all wallets and masternodes be upgraded with a newly released hot fix as soon as possible. A 51% attack occurs when a miner (or miners) acquires more than 50% of the network's mining hash power and takes control of the network. The Firo team first noticed the attack at 7 a.m. UTC, according to Firo Project Steward Reuben Yap. While the attack had ceased, it is now underway again as the attacker tries to move funds.  The Firo team implemented a block on the funds the attacker consolidated.  “Many of the pools have updated and are respecting it,” said Yap. “But the attacker is trying to get their own blocks in to make their own chain, as some of the ecosystem hasn't updated yet. The attacker is still trying to make their chain longer than ours. Once the ecosystem updates with the latest release, this problem will go away. For now, we are locking down the funds and attack vectors as we await further info from exchanges.” Hash war At the moment, from a Proof-of-Work (PoW) perspective, both chains are valid. Eventually, whoever has the most accumulated work, will become the chain of ""truth’,"" according to Yap.  The attacker is trying to move the funds, which includes transactions that move their ill-gotten gains. Other pools are trying to invalidate those transactions and keep them locked.  Read more:  Privacy Coin Firo Launches ‘Privacy by Default’ Protocol on Mainnet “So that’s why it’s a hash war,” said Yap. “The miner is mining their own chain and trying to overtake the legitimate chain.” What happened In an email, Yap told CoinDesk the attacker created a stealth chain that was mining secretly with a huge amount of hashrate.  “The hashrate doesn't appear to have been rented from the usual suspects, as Merkle Tree Proofs aren’t on NiceHash and there isn't sufficient hashrate on other sites to launch it,” said Yap. “Also, this chain was not broadcast so no one was aware of it.” Firo implemented Merkle Tree Proofs on its network for egalitarian mining. In the meantime, according to Yap, the attacker was selling huge amounts of FIRO on the market, causing a crash. Once that was done, they exposed their chain – which was longer. The longer chain invalidated the deposits they made, and the chain rolled back 300+ blocks. The attacker did several deposits of their funds on Binance before consolidating the vast majority of the funds into a single address. The Firo team then activated the Lelantus emergency switch to prevent the address from being anonymized, a function that was  previously approved by the community .  “To be clear, this was not a Lelantus flaw or a code flaw,” said Yap. “It appears to be a pure 51% attack on a large scale. What was interesting is the pattern of a massive amount of purchases prior and a big price run-up, and then these dumps.” Yap said his company is still investigating the motive behind the attack and is unsure if there is a correlation or if the funds used to do the double-spend attack were obtained during the run-up. To pull off a double-spend of this magnitude, the attacker would have had to have acquired significant amounts of FIRO legitimately. Chainlocks on Firo Firo was weeks away from deploying chainlocks, a  secondary validation layer that would have secured its chain by using its masternodes to “checkpoint every block so that you get instant finality upon block confirmation,” said Yap.  Once the chainlocks are activated, the attacker would need more than 50% control of all masternodes on top of 51% of the mining hashrate. In addition to providing a secondary layer of protection, chainlocks will also drastically increase the costs of the attack.

binance, Altcoin Watch , 3 reasons why Binance Coin (BNB) hit a new all-time high at $148 ,"On Feb. 10 Binance Coin ( BNB ) hit a new all-time high at $148 after the native exchange token rallied 121% since the start of the week.  Data from  Cointelegraph Markets  and  TradingView  shows that BNB rose from $35.37 on Jan. 11 to $148, a 256% increase in less than a month.  BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Three reasons for the explosive growth in the price of BNB include the recent surge in trading volume to a new record high, the expansion of DeFi related protocols to the Binance Smart Chain, and a steadily expanding ecosystem which is supported by new partnerships and integrations.  Surging volume Between September 2020 and December 2020 the price of BNB traded between $23 to $35 with an average daily volume of $400 million. Since Dec. 28 there has been a steady increase in 24-hour trading volume and token price as Bitcoin ( BTC ) price broke out to new highs and DeFi made its presence felt across the crypto sector.  BNB’s 24-hour trading volume surpassed $1 billion for the first time on Feb. 1 and a new record $7.52 billion volume record was set on Feb.10 as the price crossed above $148.  DeFi integration gives Binance an edge Since 2020 centralized exchanges had been ceding market share to decentralized finance protocols which offered users access to newly launched tokens and high APY returns for providing liquidity. Weekly DEX volume. Source:  Dune Analytics To make up for this loss of market share, Binance incorporated new DeFi components, including the creation of Binance DEX which supports a few interoperability-focused DeFi projects. Binance also increased the number of tokens available on its staking platform and the exchange raised the interest rates for each token to encourage investors to stay on the exchange instead of chasing yields at SushiSwap and Uniswap.  BNB plays a role in fee settlement and transfers, thus boosting its volume and value over the past few months. New listings and partnerships  Binance has not been shy about quickly listing new projects from the DeFi sector and these listings often spark a sharp increase in the trading volume and price of the newly listed token.  For example, when Uniswap and SushiSwap burst onto the scene and threatened to take some of Binance’s trading volume, the exchange countered by listing both UNI, SUSHI and many of the projects that were attracting investors’ attention.  Several prominent DeFi projects were initially launched on Binance Launchpad, the in-house token launch platform that helps blockchain projects raise funds, and more projects being added on a regular basis.  Projects like Kava, which operates on the Cosmos ( ATOM ) blockchain, and Venus (XVS), which operates on the Binance chain, were incubated on Binance Launchpad and have since become established DeFi projects that continue to gain momentum.  A scroll through Binance’s Twitter feed shows daily announcements of new partnerships and integrations and for investors to interact with many of these projects they are oftentimes using BNB as part of the transaction.  With a 24-hour trading volume of $32.8 billion, a figure 7 times larger than its closest competitor Coinbase Pro, Binance continues to dominate among centralized and decentralized exchanges.  Binance Coin appears well positioned for further growth, especially considering that BNB is an integral part of many of the platforms and processes at Binance.

binance, News , Ethereum devs grumble as Harvest Finance and Value Defi eye Binance Smart Chain  ,"Today, yield aggregator Harvest Finance and multi-service platform Value DeFi — two Ethereum-native decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols accounting for nearly a billion dollars in total value locked between them — announced planned expansions to Binance Smart Chain, the smart contract platform built by crypto exchange giant Binance. Not everyone in the Ethereum community is ready to take BSC seriously, however.  Harvest, which is among the largest yield aggregators and  currently boasts over 830 million in total value locked , said in a statement to Cointelegraph that the protocol is looking to hire two developers to bring Harvest to BSC. “At Harvest Finance we think this is an opportunity to show that ""cross chain"" yield farming is not only possible, it will be one of the next major milestones for the yield farming ecosystem,” said Harvest community moderator Red. Likewise, Value DeFi and its $40 million in TVL said in a Tweet that they were planning to port their yield-bearing governance vault to BSC, confirming earlier team statements on Discord: Cat is out of the bag on this one.  #BSC  here we come! More details on an updated roadmap coming soon   pic.twitter.com/CsTdWS6l5C — Value DeFi Protocol (@value_defi)  February 11, 2021 
 
 The announcements come during a period of explosive growth for BSC. Projects on Binance Smart Chain such as  PancakeSwap have been on a tear as of late , and even before the announced moves the recent run of success has led some members of the Ethereum developer community to ask which is more valuable: a platform scalable enough that all players can feasibly participate, or a credible degree of decentralization?  Testnet or true ecosystem? BSC, whose architecture is  supported by 21 validator nodes all run by Binance  or its affiliates, has been characterized by some developers as an elaborate Ethereum testnet, given its cheap transactions and centralization: Before you complain, BSC is hot rn because no one ever invested much in Ethereum testnets like  #goerli  and making them profitable as a playground — I'm just a doggie boi (@fubuloubu)  February 10, 2021 
 
 According to  Scoopy , the semi-anon co-founder of the forthcoming AlchemixFi project, the centralization means that BSC is destined to remain populated with copycat projects originally born on Ethereum. “My view on the matter is that while it may offer some improvements to user experience with faster and cheaper transactions, it is counter to the decentralized ethos that has inspired countless developers to build on Ethereum,” they said. “Innovation will continue to be centered in Ethereum as a result.” Other traders and developers are less concerned with originality and thorough decentralization, however. In an interview with Cointelegraph, Red said that even though Ethereum is “the king of kings,” profit maximalism is what motivates Harvest.  “Harvest sees a growing number of projects that are attempting to alleviate the pain associated with high gas costs on Ethereum,” said Red. “[...] Harvest is focused on providing the best sources of yield for farmers. If that yield exists on another chain, and can be safely utilized, we will turn on the tractors.” More accessibility, more users Aside from developmental and ideological scruples, BSC’s transaction costs are increasingly difficult to ignore for projects looking to provide value for their users. The recent  spike is gas costs is a genuine barrier for retail investors , especially when it comes to more complex contract interactions. Value DeFi specifically mentioned these gas costs as a pain point in their BSC announcement.  Members of the Premia Republic, an  all-anon team building the Premia options protocol , said that unless a project is building with explicit decentralization in mind, BSC is simply a path to a larger pool of users capable of using a smart contract product.  “[We] don't think building on bsc is a bad thing at all. Whether everyone agrees or not, retail and a large portion of the participating market are being priced out of some of the services offered in defi due to gas fees,” they said.  “Some may build/port to bsc because they would like to capitalize on the profits and economic activity happening, but in [our] opinion, you're simply opening yourself up to an additional market.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/ethereum-devs-grumble-as-harvest-finance-and-value-defi-eye-binance-smart-chain,cointelegraph,2021-02-12,00:00:00,en,693,4327,5.203463203463204,274,0.3953823953823954,today yield aggregator harvest finance multi service platform defi ethereum native decentralized finance defi protocol accounting dollar total locked announced planned expansion binance chain contract platform built crypto exchange giant binance ethereum community bsc harvest largest yield aggregator boast total locked statement cointelegraph protocol hire developer bring harvest bsc harvest finance opportunity show chain yield farming milestone yield farming ecosystem harvest community moderator likewise defi tvl tweet planning port yield bearing governance vault bsc confirming earlier team statement discord cat bag bsc detail updated roadmap coming pic twitter cstdws defi protocol defi announcement period explosive growth bsc project binance chain pancakeswap tear late announced move recent run success led member ethereum developer community valuable platform scalable player feasibly participate credible degree decentralization testnet ecosystem bsc architecture supported validator node run binance affiliate characterized developer elaborate ethereum testnet cheap transaction centralization complain bsc hot rn invested ethereum testnets goerli making profitable playground doggie boi fubuloubu scoopy semi anon founder forthcoming alchemixfi project centralization bsc destined remain populated copycat project originally ethereum view matter offer improvement user experience faster cheaper transaction counter decentralized ethos inspired countless developer build ethereum innovation continue centered ethereum result trader developer concerned originality decentralization interview cointelegraph ethereum king profit maximalism motivates harvest harvest see growing number project attempting alleviate pain gas cost ethereum harvest focused providing source yield farmer yield exists chain safely utilized turn tractor accessibility user developmental ideological scruple bsc transaction cost increasingly difficult ignore project provide user recent spike gas cost genuine retail investor complex contract interaction defi specifically mentioned gas cost pain point bsc announcement member premia republic anon team building premia option protocol project building explicit decentralization mind bsc simply path larger user capable contract product building bsc bad thing agrees retail portion participating market priced service offered defi due gas fee build port bsc capitalize profit economic activity happening opinion simply opening additional market,0.06400000000000002,positive,0.5542380952380952,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.812, 'pos': 0.131, 'compound': 0.9682}",0.9682,0.057,0.812,0.131,positive,0.05263157617728546,0.06440677944268888,positive
binance,Markets,Kakao to Record Private Securities on Its Own Blockchain as NFTs,"South Korean internet giant Kakao’s blockchain arm  Ground X  is now storing and verifying unlisted investments as nonfungible tokens (NFTs) on its public blockchain. Unlisted investments are shares of startups that are offered to investors for purchase prior to a public offering. Since these securities are not listed on formal markets, they are traded over the counter (OTC).  South Korea’s OTC trading market is growing: the country’s OTC exchange  K-OTC  ended 2020 with a  record-high market capitalization  of over 1 trillion won ($1.1 billion) since its launch in 2014. Foreign investors can also buy and trade OTC shares in South Korea. In 2018, South Korea  amended  its tax laws to exempt foreign investors from capital gains taxes on transfers of both listed and unlisted stocks.  Ground X has partnered with local equity management and trading platforms like  QuotaBook  and  Angel League  that offer investors the opportunity to buy shares of promising unlisted startups or record and store ownership information.  According to an emailed press release, information about unlisted shares, including face value, number of shares and the shareholder’s name will be recorded on Klaytn, the blockchain developed by Ground X.  The record of the share is then minted as an NFT and offered to shareholders as a digital card through the digital wallet  Klip , which is embedded in South Korea’s popular messaging app KakaoTalk. KakaoTalk serves around  50 million users  worldwide, and Klip is available to all KakaoTalk users.   Unlisted shares are typically available to investors through internal connections at the firm offering them, but they can also be bought via dealers that make the securities available for sale. According to Inés Chun ,  communications manager at Ground X, Angel League is open to anybody interested in investing in unlisted companies that are offered on the platform which are managed by experienced investors.  On the contrary, investors cannot buy unlisted shares on QuotaBook, Chun said.   “Many startups in their pre-IPO stage here in Korea use QuotaBook, and the shareholders of such startups can mint their unlisted investments information as NFT cards. Or let’s say, you have unlisted shares of some startup and that company now chooses to use QuotaBook, then you can also have your NFT,” Chun told CoinDesk via an email. In South Korea, people who buy unlisted shares can send or sell those shares to somebody else, but not through either QuotaBook or Angel League, Chun said. If shareholders want to sell a share bought on Angel League, they have to do so on the platform, he added.  “For Angel League, specifically, you can buy shares that Angel League only offers. But let’s say you’re interested in some shares that Angel League doesn’t offer, then maybe you’d have to look for some other platform,” Chun said.  According to  GrowthFunders , a U.K.-based platform that offers investors the chance to buy into unlisted companies, since these shares are not listed on an open market, they are  highly illiquid . This means they cannot be easily sold until a company goes public, after which the shares may be diluted. In March 2019, Ground X  raised  $90 million through a private coin offering, followed shortly by the  launch  of the Klaytn blockchain in June of the same year. In late 2019, Binance  joined  Klaytn’s 24-company governance council. In November 2020, MakerDAO also  joined  the council.  The launch of the Klip wallet, which was scheduled for late 2019, was  delayed . Klip and its token Klay, are now operational, and support the Kakao blockchain ecosystem accessible to all KakaoTalk users. ",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/02/17/kakao-to-record-private-securities-on-its-own-blockchain-as-nfts/,coindesk,2021-02-17,00:00:00,en,589,3657,5.142614601018676,224,0.38030560271646857,korean internet giant kakao blockchain arm ground storing verifying unlisted investment nonfungible token nfts public blockchain unlisted investment share startup offered investor purchase public offering security listed formal market traded counter otc korea otc trading market growing country otc exchange otc ended record market capitalization launch foreign investor buy trade otc share korea korea amended tax exempt foreign investor capital gain tax transfer listed unlisted ground partnered local equity management trading platform quotabook league offer investor opportunity buy share promising unlisted startup record store ownership information emailed press release information unlisted share including face number share shareholder recorded klaytn blockchain developed ground record share minted nft offered shareholder digital digital wallet klip embedded korea popular messaging app kakaotalk kakaotalk serf user worldwide klip kakaotalk user unlisted share typically investor internal connection firm offering bought dealer make security inés communication manager ground league open interested investing unlisted company offered platform managed experienced investor contrary investor buy unlisted share quotabook startup pre ipo stage korea quotabook shareholder startup mint unlisted investment information nft card unlisted share startup company chooses quotabook nft told coindesk email korea people buy unlisted share send share quotabook league shareholder share bought league platform added league specifically buy share league offer interested share league offer platform growthfunders based platform offer investor buy unlisted company share listed open market highly illiquid easily sold company public share diluted ground raised private coin offering shortly launch klaytn blockchain late binance joined klaytn company governance makerdao joined launch klip wallet scheduled late delayed klip token klay operational support kakao blockchain ecosystem accessible kakaotalk user,0.07228395061728395,positive,0.3916049382716049,"{'neg': 0.006, 'neu': 0.771, 'pos': 0.222, 'compound': 0.9946}",0.9946,0.006,0.771,0.222,positive,0.0,0.05128205106289722,neutral

At the time of writing, PancakeSwap’s average daily trading volume stands at $1.6 billion, up from $1.2 billion of Uniswap, according to  CoinGecko . Binance CEO  Changpeng Zhao  noted that BNB has been setting new all-time highs not only in fiat terms, but also in relation to the world’s largest cryptocurrency, Bitcoin ( BTC ). “From a humble 0.00001 BTC per BNB, we have grown 480x against BTC in the last 3 and half years,” Zhao  wrote . He said that BNB’s performance against BTC has been the main goal of Binance: “This has always been our goal, to grow a bit faster than BTC. Not over taking it, but with so much effort we put in, we want to see it grow a bit faster. Otherwise, we should just buy BTC and not work.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-coin-becomes-the-third-largest-crypto-following-parabolic-rally,cointelegraph,2021-02-19,00:00:00,en,349,2074,4.916905444126074,112,0.3209169054441261,binance coin bnb cryptocurrency issued world largest crypto exchange binance hit historical milestone largest coin market capitalization time history time writing bnb market cap stand outstripping biggest stablecoin tether usdt data crypto tracking source coingecko binance coin trading past hour skyrocketing past day publishing time source coingecko alongside propelled growth market capitalization bnb spike trading volume average trading volume binance coin hit time today yesterday binance coin entrance top coin market cap massive rally reported cointelegraph bnb recorded surge yesterday outperforming xrp largest coin polkadot cardano bnb surge amid success binance chain based decentralized exchange pancakeswap decentralized finance platform parabolic growth past overtaking uniswap largest decentralized exchange trading volume yesterday time writing pancakeswap average trading volume stand uniswap coingecko binance ceo changpeng noted bnb setting time high fiat term relation world largest cryptocurrency bitcoin btc btc bnb grown btc half year wrote bnb performance btc goal binance goal bit faster btc taking effort put bit faster buy btc work,-0.02333333333333333,negative,0.3415151515151515,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.935, 'pos': 0.065, 'compound': 0.8658}",0.8658,0.0,0.935,0.065,positive,0.99999950000025,0.012903225723204995,positive
binance, Altcoin Watch ," Exchange tokens BNB, HT, FTT and OKB are on fire in February — Here's why ","Bitcoin’s ( BTC ) current bull run continues to attract institutional investors who are finally realizing its long-term potential. The latest to take the Bitcoin plunge is  BlackRock Financial Management , which has “started to dabble a bit” in crypto investments, according to the investment giant’s chief investment officer Rick Rieder. In another positive, investment advisory The Motley Fool projected that Bitcoin could rise to $500,000 over the next 15 years. The firm  announced its plans to buy $5 million  worth of Bitcoin and has also advised its 10X real-money portfolio members to make the digital asset a part of their core holding. The firm said it is not worried about short-term price fluctuations due to its long-term investment horizon. Although Bitcoin garners most of the attention, there are several altcoins that have been skyrocketing in the past few days. One set of tokens that have been surging in February are exchange tokens. Let’s look at the fundamentals of the top four exchanges that make them stand out and attractive compared to their competitors and analyze their charts to project the target on the upside. BNB/USD Binance Coin ( BNB ) is the biggest cryptocurrency exchange token with a market capitalization of over $40 billion. In a bull phase, trading activity surges and Binance has benefited from this. A sign of a good business is when it quickly adapts to the changing landscape. When the decentralized finance boom happened, Binance was quick to jump on the bandwagon and add support to DeFi projects. Binance Smart Chain (BSC) has emerged as a possible substitute for the Ethereum network that is facing issues with  high transaction fees . BSC has grown in  popularity  and the total value locked (TVL) on the network has risen over $10.5 billion, according to  data  from Defistation. The two largest  projects  on BSC are Venus (XVS) and PancakeSwap (CAKE), which have $3.9 billion and $3.6 billion in TVL. To attract further customers and projects, the BSC community  reduced  transaction costs to 10 Gwei from 15 Gwei. The current bull run has attracted a record number of new traders to the crypto space. According to data from SimilarWeb, Binance was the third most popular website in the “Finance > Investing'' category, with 136 million monthly visitors in January making it the 381st most popular website worldwide. This web traffic  is continuing to rise further in February . Binance Coin has been in a phenomenal run in February putting it in  third place by market capitalization . The token has rallied from $43.4331 on Feb. 1 to an intraday high at $284.08 today, a 554% gain within 19 days. The vertical rally has pushed the relative strength index (RSI) above 93, which suggests the token is extremely overbought. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source:  Tradingview Such vertical rallies usually end up in a sharp correction. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $220.6374 and then the 50% retracement at $201.04. If the price rebounds off this support zone, the bulls will once again try to resume the uptrend. If they succeed in pushing the price above $284.08, the uptrend could resume, with the next target objective at $367. On the other hand, if the bears sink the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $181.4426, the BNB/USD pair could completely retrace the latest leg of the up-move and drop to $118, just below the 20-day exponential moving average at $125. Such a deep fall will suggest the momentum has weakened and that could delay the next leg of the uptrend, keeping the pair stuck inside a range for a few days. HT/USD Huobi Token (HT) has also benefited during the current crypto bull run and its market cap has risen to over $3.69 billion. Some of the steps taken by Huobi may have helped the platform attract traders. During a strong bull phase, traders use leverage and borrow money to trade. Huobi’s launch of crypto loans on Jan. 5 with up to 50% discount till Feb. 3 could not have come at a better time. In addition, the launch of the Huobi Eco-Chain Heco mainnet on Dec. 21 could be seen as a long-term positive. Heco seems to have quickly picked up momentum with the core assets TVL reaching $1.38 billion on Feb. 5. To further expand its services to the traders, Heco recently tied up with decentralized derivatives trading platform Injective, which could increase cross-chain derivatives adoption, enabling traders to bridge assets between the two entities. Additionally, Huobi DeFi labs has tied up with Kava Labs to expand into the DeFi market and offer its users access to the Kava ecosystem. HT has surged from $6.4808 on Feb. 1 to an intraday high at $19.4555 today, a 200% rally within three weeks. This sharp up-move has pushed the RSI above 88, which shows the token is overbought in the near term. HT/USDT daily chart. Source:  Tradingview The HT/USD pair is likely to face resistance between the $19.4017 and $20.3162 overhead resistance zone. If the price turns down from the zone, the first support is at the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement at $16.0981 and then at the 50% retracement at $15.0611. A strong rebound off either support level will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders are buying on dips. If the bulls can thrust the price above the resistance zone, the next leg of the up-move to $25 could begin. Conversely, if the price breaks below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement at $14.0240, the correction may deepen to the 20-day EMA ($11.51). A break below this support will suggest that a short-term top is in place. FTT/USD After starting its journey like any other crypto exchange in April 2019, FTX Token (FTT) started innovating in 2020 and that has helped it  attract a huge client base . FTX has focused on adding several products that benefit the short-term momentum traders. In early 2020, the daily and weekly binary Bitcoin options were launched and that was followed by the introduction of leveraged tokens such as the 3x Long Bitcoin and 3x Short Litecoin. The exchange further expanded its offering by starting tokenized equity trading where it allows traders to buy less than one share, which is useful for small traders who want to buy high-priced stocks. However, this service is currently not available to U.S. citizens. Its innovative products such as pre-IPO futures contracts, thematic products, and  prediction  markets attract a diaspora of clients that are not covered by other exchanges. FTX quickly introduces products to fulfill the trader’s requirements. A recent example of that was the  launch  of a Wall Street Bets Index that will contain the most discussed stocks in the hugely popular r/Wallstreetbets Reddit group. FTX’s Project Serum, the decentralized exchange and ecosystem, is an attempt to capture the DeFi crowd and it could  add  value in the long term if the innovation continues. FTT has been in a strong bull run for the past few weeks. It has risen from $10.815 on Feb. 1 to an intraday high at $30.077 today, a 178% rally in 19 days. The rally has pushed the RSI deep into the overbought territory, which suggests the token could be due for a correction or consolidation. FTT/USD daily chart. Source:  TradingView The long wick on today’s candlestick suggests profit-booking at higher levels. The first support on the downside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level at $25.655 and below that at the 50% retracement at $24.289. If the price rebounds off this support, it will suggest the sentiment remains bullish and traders continue to buy on dips. The bulls will then try to resume the uptrend by pushing the price above $30.077. If they succeed, the next leg of the uptrend could begin. The next target objective on the upside is $35.866 and then $37.232. Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $22.922, the correction could deepen to the 20-day EMA ($19.32). A strong rebound off this level will suggest the uptrend remains intact while a break below the 20-day EMA will tip the scales to the bears. OKB/USD OKEx ( OKB ) was struggling when the current bull market was starting last year.  Rumors  were afloat that its CEO was under criminal investigation and the exchange had halted withdrawals from mid-October to  late  November last year. Naturally, several investors  fled  the exchange when withdrawals resumed. However, OKEx has taken certain steps to again attract clients. It started real-time settlements for all perpetual swaps, futures and options contracts in a phased manner from the end of December last year. The exchange  launched  OKExChain mainnet on Dec. 31, 2020, offering an opportunity for the early adopters to earn about 10 million OKT tokens as rewards. On Jan. 22, two decentralized applications OKEx Swap and OKEx Farm were launched on OKExChain, enabling users to mine their OKT tokens. OKEx recently announced plans to  integrate  with Bitcoin’s Lightning Network “in the coming quarter” experimenting with faster and cheaper Bitcoin transactions. The exchange also announced  support  for the simplified address format from Unstoppable Domains. OKEx is trying to make a comeback and only time will tell if it has succeeded in redeeming itself. OKB has risen from $5.652 on Feb. 1 to an intraday high at $12.555 today, a 122% gain in less than three weeks. The token is currently in a strong uptrend but is nearing its target objective at $12.839. OKB/USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push the price above $12.839, the uptrend could extend to $13.87 and then $15. However, the RSI has risen above 81 level, which suggests the OKB/USD pair is overbought in the short term. If the price turns down from the current level or the overhead resistance, the first stop is likely to be a retest of the previous resistance turned support at $9.50. If the pair rebounds off this level, it will act as a new floor for launching the next leg of the uptrend. On the contrary, if the pair dips and sustains below $9.50, a fall to the 20-day EMA ($8.3) is possible. A break below this support will tilt the advantage in favor of the bears.

binance,Markets,BNB Gains 45% in 24 Hours as PancakeSwap ‘Flippens’ Uniswap Volume,"The native token of one of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges is astral planing above new heights. Binance Coin (BNB) is having its time in the sun, up 50% and trading at around $271, thanks to increased interest in decentralized exchanges and a relatively new decentralized finance (DeFi) project known as  PancakeSwap . The DeFi project has flipped its doppelganger  Uniswap , as Binance's CEO Changpeng Zhao  noted on Twitter  a short time ago.

binance, Altcoin Watch , Exchange tokens benefit as centralized exchanges battle with DeFi platforms  ,"Fresh institutional and retail investor inflows into the cryptocurrency market have led to bull market conditions for many top tokens from blue-chips like Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) to more recently established DeFi projects like AAVE and  Synthetix  (SNX). Exchange tokens are another easily overlooked sub-sector of the market but they have been performing exceptionally well in 2021 as increases in trading volumes results in a larger pool of fees to collect when the exchange’s native token is used for settlement. Native exchange tokens are also typically used as the base pair for funding new listings and token buybacks.  Here are three of the top-performing exchange tokens in 2021 that continue to see upside potential as new investors flood into the market.  Similar to the experience of CryptoKitty users in 2017, the decentralized finance community has discovered that the main drawback of increased usage of the Ethereum network is high gas fees and long transaction times.  As a result, centralized exchanges and their associated native tokens have seen renewed interest as new features like staking, yield farming and collateralization allow investors to profit from holding their investments. These new offerings also allow investors to participate in DeFi-like offerings without worrying about impermanent loss and they also receive access to the latest coin listings.  BNB/USDT Binance Coin ( BNB ) recently experienced a price breakout to a new high of $349.13 on Feb.19 as the top exchange by volume evolves both its centralized and decentralized exchange capabilities alongside further upgrades to the Binance Smart Chain. BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Several DeFi-related projects, including Venus (VNS) and Linear Finance (LINA) launched on the BSC in recent weeks which utilizes the BNB token to pay transaction fees on the network.  Binance also offers a continually expanding list of “investment products” that allow users to lend their tokens to the exchange pools in return for varying degrees of yield opportunities depending on lock-up periods and token demand.  Popular coins are quickly added to the growing list of tokens with options or futures trading capabilities, offering something for both devoted community members as well as pessimists who would rather take their chance at shorting newly listed assets.  Trading volume dominance and the benefits of having the first-mover advantage point to further upside potential for the Binance ecosystem and BNB.  Binance’s steady expansion and its active project incubator and Binance Smart Chain are designed to challenge Ethereum’s dominance in the sector, thus there remains a strong possibility that BNB could see an extension of recent gains.  FTT/USDT The traditional finance and cryptocurrency markets are slowly beginning to merge and developing products for all types of traders. In 2020, derivatives exchanges also increased in popularity and their trading volumes steadily rose to new highs on a weekly basis.  Following the U.S. government crackdown on controversial derivatives exchange BitMEX, the door was opened for a newer, more community focused option to fill the gap.  FTX Token (FTT) is the exchange token for the FTX cryptocurrency exchange which got its start in the summer of 2019. For much of that first year, FTT traded below $2 with an average trading volume of $2 million as the exchange worked on establishing itself and attracting new users.  The exchange began to see an uptick in activity in 2020 which coincided with an increase in trading volume for FTT as well as its price.  As the platform expanded, additional functionality was added to the token which now includes fee rebates, staking and a ‘Buy & Burn’ mechanism that helps decrease FTT’s circulating supply to increase token value.  FTT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Since Dec.11 when FTT was trading at $4.12, a surge in buying volume which reached a peak of $270 million on Feb.19 has propelled FTT to a new record high of $35.01 as the exchange is rapidly becoming the go-to derivatives exchange for the cryptocurrency community.  KCS/USDT KuCoin Shares (KCS) has been a late bloomer in this bull market, maintaining a relatively flat token value until the beginning of February when a sudden uptick in trading volume helped elevate KCS price from $1.19 on Feb.2 to a recent high of $3.99 on Feb.19.  VORTECS™ data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  began to detect a bullish outlook for KCS on Feb. 18 when it reached a high of 66, less than 24-hours before the price breakout.  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  - VORTECS™ Score (green) vs. KCS price The VORTECS™ score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity. A scroll through the project’s Twitter feed shows that on Feb.4 the biggest announcement coming out of the exchange was the listing of the popular blockchain-based  video streaming platform Theta , which had previously been difficult to obtain for U.S. residents.  KuCoin also offers a growing list of tokens available for derivatives trading along with various ways to earn through staking or providing liquidity, with fees generated by the platform distributed to token holders who keep their KCS staked on the exchange.  DeFi hype overshadows exchange token gains DeFi may be dominating the conversation in the cryptocurrency sector right now, but major issues including gas fees remain a barrier to widespread adoption.  While the roll out of layer two solutions may offer some relief to this problem, concerns about liquidity across separate blockchains continue to pose significant barriers to a smooth, low-cost trading experience.  Many who are chasing the DeFi hype fail to realize that popular token listings and lower trading fees have led to a resurgence in the use of centralized exchanges.  This translates into a larger user base that conducts more transactions, leading to an increase in trading volumes and healthy price appreciation for underlying exchange tokens like BNB, FTT and KCS.  Centralized exchanges still capture the majority of trading volume and this does not appear to be changing anytime soon. While decentralized exchanges like Uniswap and SushiSwap are growing in prominence and beginning to eat into the market share of centralized exchanges, they still comprise only a small portion of total trading volume seen in the cryptocurrency market. The battle between exchanges is continuing to heat up and as long as this is the case, the increased inflow to exchange tokens could lead to future upside.

binance,Business,Coinbase Is Going Public: Everything You Need to Know,"Coinbase, the largest crypto exchange in the United States, has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to become a publicly traded company through a direct listing (and not an initial public offering). Here’s what you need to know. Coinbase is a San Francisco-based crypto exchange that first opened its doors in 2012. Founded by  Brian Armstrong  and  Fred Ersham , the  platform  now has over 56 million users worldwide and has transacted more than $456 billion to date – per the S-1  filing  with the SEC. jwplayer(""jw-video-sgJzaF5p"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/sgJzaF5p""}) The story so far On Jan. 28, the exchange formally  announced  its plans to go public via a direct listing on Nasdaq, “pursuant to a proposed direct listing of its Class A common stock.” This confirmed rumors from a Reuters  report  that emerged in July last year that stated the company was interested in listing on the stock market. Initially, it was believed Coinbase would raise capital through an initial public offering (IPO); a process that involves creating new shares and employing the help of underwriters – usually banks – to help promote and market them to prospective investors. Instead, Coinbase has decided to pursue a direct listing, aka direct public offering (DPO), which essentially means cutting out intermediaries and only selling shares that already exist. No new shares will be created. There are three distinct advantages of this route over an IPO: It’s much cheaper : Companies that already have a strong market presence don’t necessarily need the help of underwriters. A DPO dramatically reduces the costs of going public. The existing shares aren’t diluted:  Because new shares aren’t created during direct listings, it means existing employee and investor shares aren’t at risk of being diluted once the company goes public. Dilution is where newly created shares enter the market and drive the price of the existing shares down. It’s much faster:  By cutting out middlemen, there are far fewer regulatory hurdles to jump through before going public, including filing underwriter contracts with the SEC. At the end of 2020, Coinbase  filed   preliminary documents  with the SEC, signaling the start of a public listing process. On Feb. 25, Coinbase’s Form S-1 was officially  published  by the SEC. Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Securities were among the banks chosen by Coinbase to aid it through the listing process. Following the  quarterly earnings call  on April 6, Coinbase said its monthly transacting users have grown 117% quarter-on-quarter, helping it to secure a net income of $800 million since the start of 2021. What symbol will Coinbase shares trade under? Coinbase Class A shares will debut on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker COIN. When will Coinbase COIN shares be listed? Coinbase  announced  on April 1 that COIN shares will be available to purchase on the Nasdaq exchange from April 14 with a  reference price  of $250 per share. Who will be able to buy Coinbase COIN shares? Since COIN shares will be listed on the Nasdaq exchange, it means anyone who has an account with a brokerage that deals in U.S. stocks will be able to purchase COIN shares. Similarly, investors will also be able to purchase COIN shares on any mobile trading app that lists Nasdaq Global Select Market stocks. Leading centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance  announced  it will be listing COIN stock tokens on its platform too. It  describes  these new stock token assets as ""zero-commission digital tokens fully backed by a depository portfolio of underlying securities that represents the outstanding tokens"" and entitles holders to ""economic returns on the underlying shares, including potential dividends."" COIN stock tokens will be traded against Binance's native stablecoin, BUSD, and means users will be able to purchase fractional COIN shares. On March 17, Coinbase  published  an amended  S-1a form  that stated the company plans to issue 114,850,796 shares of Class A common stock for a total price of $943,218,155.

binance, News , Top 3 NFT brands' sales grew 381% in February ,"NFTs had their best month ever in February, according to a  report  by DApp statistics trackers at DappRadar. Sales volume from the top three platforms grew to $342 million in February, up almost 400% from the $71 million recorded the month before. Sports memorabilia platform NBA Top Shot dominated the sector and is now responsible for 67% of total NFT transaction volume. The other NFT DApps in the top three are OpenSea, a general crypto collectibles market and CryptoPunks, an Ethereum-based collectibles series. CryptoPunks generated all-time high sales of $79M with the floor price of punks increasing from $10,000 to an average of $32,000. Keep up to date with the latest industry trends.

 The DappRadar report also mentioned the tremendous rise in the popularity of generative art, which is art created at least in part by autonomous systems.  High gas fees on the Ethereum network saw several DeFi and NFT projects move off the platform in February, in favor of those with less costly transactions. Binance Chain recently surpassed Ethereum in terms of transaction volume and unique active wallet count and the report noted the rapid growth of several copycat NFT projects on Binance Chain, such as Binance Punks and Bashmarks. 5) Move NFT platform to Binance chain to avoid high gas fees  — Matthew ₿lack [340-342➞] (@matthewjablack)  February 28, 2021 
 
 Despite high gas fees, statistics from CryptoSlam show that seven of last month’s top 10 best-selling NFT  products  are still hosted on Ethereum.   NBA Top Shot uses the Flow blockchain  and the remaining two arehosted on WAX.  The fastest rising brand among the top 10 is CryptoKitties, which saw a resurgence in popularity as month-over-month sales increased over 1,300%. The newest entrant to place in CryptoSlam’s top 10 sales list is  Capcom’s Street Fighter II series , which is currently #8, with $1.26 M in sales since its Feb. 16 launch.

 NFTs garnered so much attention in the first six weeks of the year that CoinMarketCap added a dedicated  section  for the sect on Feb. 15. A record price for a single NFT sale was set on Feb. 26 when a  Beeple Crossroads NFT sold for $6.6 million , more than 100 times its original price.  On Mar. 2, a new NFT sales record was set when electronic music artist 3LAU  sold  $11.6 M worth of NFTs from his own website in a single evening. Only hours earlier, musician Grimes  completed $5.8 M in NFT sales  in 20 minutes. Not everyone is impressed by the rapid rise of NFTs. On Mar. 2, Litecoin creator Charlie Lee  compared the surge in NFT popularity to the ICO craze  that occurred through much of 2017.

binance, News , Binance Smart Chain 'copykat' project loses $31 million in possible rugpull ,"At roughly 9 am UTC today Meerkat, a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol on Binance’s smart contract platform, lost $31 million worth of BNB tokens. While the team initially claimed that they had been the victim of an exploit, they have since  deleted  all social channels, and due to the nature of the exploit some believe the team liquidated and pilfered user funds — a type of scam colloquially referred to as a “rugpull.”  A fork of  Ethereum-native yield vault protocol Yearn Finance , Meerkat was just a few hours old when the attack drained its vaults. On-chain  transactions  show that an address upgraded the Meerkat deployer contract, granting the address permission to liquidate vault holdings. Users have now taken to Binance community channels to report their  losses .  As of publication, Binance has released no official statement on the loss.  Given BSC’s centralized nature and the lack of a  privacy-preserving “mixer” tool like Tornado Cash  on the chain, some users are hopeful that Binance will be able to track down the responsible party and step in to mitigate the effects of the hack.  Team's claiming it was a ""hack"" but the TXs don't lead to that conclusion.  Dev I talked to who looked at it said this should be catchable by  @binance  due to the sheer size, 13m+, no dex that can handle BEP has enough LIQ for that.  https://t.co/tg8npVZcBi — Pen (@Crypto_Pen)  March 4, 2021 
 
 However, Binance has yet to intervene in BSC traffic in such a manner, despite significant goading in the form of a racist yield farming project released last week.  Rugpull or exploit, there is now ongoing cause for concern for BSC users.  Last week an Ethereum-native yield vault project, Yeld, was drained of all funds from their stablecoin DAI vault. In a since- deleted  blog post, the team warned that the exploit was the result of a flaw in the code they’d forked from Yearn, which the Yearn team had since patched. Dozens of other forked projects could be similarly exposed, they said.  While forking is common in Ethereum DeFi circles, BSC has elevated it to an art: many of the staple Ethereum dapps and even art projects have an exact Binance replica, meaning that  previous attack vectors that plagued the DeFi summer  may now have been reopened on the increasingly-popular chain.  Centralization and forking risks aside, the allure of cheap BSC transactions has nonetheless been too potent for many Ethereum developers to resist. A swath of teams including  Harvest Finance, Value DeFi, Sushiswap, and 1inch  have announced implementations on the chain.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-smart-chain-copykat-project-loses-31-million-in-possible-rugpull,cointelegraph,2021-03-04,00:00:00,en,427,2576,4.964871194379391,174,0.40749414519906324,roughly utc today meerkat decentralized finance defi protocol binance contract platform lost bnb token team initially claimed victim exploit deleted social channel due nature exploit team liquidated pilfered user fund type scam colloquially referred rugpull fork ethereum native yield vault protocol yearn finance meerkat hour attack drained vault chain transaction show address upgraded meerkat deployer contract granting address permission liquidate vault holding user binance community channel report loss publication binance released official statement loss bsc centralized nature lack privacy preserving mixer tool tornado chain user hopeful binance track responsible party step mitigate effect team claiming tx lead conclusion dev talked looked catchable binance due sheer size dex handle bep liq http tg npvzcbi pen crypto pen binance intervene bsc traffic manner significant goading form racist yield farming project released rugpull exploit ongoing concern bsc user ethereum native yield vault project yeld drained fund stablecoin dai vault deleted blog team warned exploit result flaw code forked yearn yearn team patched dozen forked project similarly exposed forking common ethereum defi circle bsc elevated staple ethereum dapps project exact binance replica meaning previous attack vector plagued defi reopened increasingly popular chain centralization forking risk allure cheap bsc transaction nonetheless potent ethereum developer resist swath team including harvest finance defi sushiswap inch announced implementation chain,0.09166666666666667,positive,0.4286458333333334,"{'neg': 0.169, 'neu': 0.759, 'pos': 0.072, 'compound': -0.9559}",-0.9559,0.169,0.759,0.072,negative,-0.6521738846880919,0.11386138557494364,negative
binance, News , Binance Smart Chain’s TurtleDex rug-pulls shortly after launch ,"Turns out a turtle’s arms are plenty long enough to pull a rug.  On Friday, Binance Smart Chain, or BSC, file storage project TurtleDex performed a “rug pull” exit scam — a colloquial term for when a project’s developers drain the liquidity or stored funds invested by the protocol. Coming off of a March 15 presale round that raised 9,000 Binance Coin ( BNB ) tokens worth nearly $2.5 million, the team drained those funds from trading pools on BSC-native decentralized exchanges PancakeSwap and ApeSwap, converted the liquidity to Ether ( ETH ), and sent the funds to Binance exchange wallets to be sold, according to TurtleDex team wallet  transactions . Jetfuel Finance, a yield vault protocol that had partnered with TurtleDex on a farming initiative, confirmed the rug pull on Twitter, saying it was “shocked” by the scam: Attention - The Turtledex ( #TTDX ) team has exit scammed. We are just as shocked as everyone to see this unfold.  Please see the tweet below from  @DefiStalker  and help us track down the funds sent to  @binance   #TTDX  is being removed from Jetfuel.  https://t.co/ZUjRmPbrs2   https://t.co/3WvsYSWATg — Jet Fuel BSC ✈️ (@Jetfuelfinance)  March 19, 2021 
 
 The TurtleDex website has gone dark, and social channels have been deleted.  Some investors pointed out that the project had previously been audited and no severe security issues were identified, prompting a renewed  round of criticism about the efficacy of audits .  #TurtleDex   $TTDX  s/contract was audited by  @TechRate1  on 21st of FEB, 2021. Whilst no big issues were found, it asks the question, what is the purpose of a s/contract audit?

 Ironically, according to screenshots, prospective investors had asked the team about the possibility of a rug pull in official channels. The team responded jokingly by saying that it would be impossible, as a turtle’s arms are too short.  hello, sir pls help, I am under the water  @cz_binance   @binance    $ttdx   pic.twitter.com/ORnpMoFFuw — Danusarf (@Danusarf)  March 19, 2021 
 
 “Chasing funds back” Despite the loss, there may be hope for the jilted TurtleDex investors. Shortly after the Meerkat Finance rugpull — one of the  largest-ever decentralized finance scams, at $31 million  — a developer for the project announced that the scam was an “experiment,” and that  all funds would be returned to users . This flimsy “experiment” backing and abrupt about-face prompted some speculation that Binance may have stepped in to mitigate the effects of the scam. BSC is a semi-closed system, with Binance controlling on- and off-ramps to the ecosystem; rug-pulled funds have few ways to exit BSC, without passing Binance’s centralized control.  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao — better known as CZ — noted on Twitter earlier in the week that the exchange had helped in “chasing funds back” when other rug-pulled projects attempted to sell funds via Binance.  Most welcome. We actually help with a few rug pulls recently too.

binance,Tech,Cosmos Investors Vote to Approve Inter-Blockchain Communication,"The long-awaited vision of the Cosmos blockchain has now been realized, as holders of the  ATOM  token have voted through  inter-blockchain communication  (IBC), enabling assets to transfer easily between blockchains. The  final vote  to enable the feature was 112 million to 75, overwhelmingly in support of activation. In the simplest terms, IBC enables messages to travel between blockchains that have implemented the standard. The most obvious use case in crypto is sending messages to transfer tokens off one chain and onto another. ""At its core, IBC is a method of securely exchanging data between two independent (sovereign) blockchains. This means that any two blockchains that support IBC can send communication back and forth in a permissionless manner,"" Zarko Milosevic, chief scientist at the blockchain consultancy Informal Systems, told CoinDesk by email. This development has the potential to open up opportunities in the  decentralized finance (DeFi)  sector, where a product on an application-specific blockchain could use an asset from a completely different chain. For example, ATOM is the governance token for Cosmos, the blockchain built to enable IBC. ""Previously, ATOM was relegated to the Cosmos Hub with regard to its utility as a governance token. It is now transferable and interoperable with all blockchains that support IBC,"" Milosevic said. Pent-up demand One place ATOM may go: the Terra blockchain, which runs  a DeFi savings account  called Anchor. Terra could plug in to IBC and make ATOM one of the tokens its underlying money market will loan. IBC was built into the Stargate upgrade enabled by the Cosmos ecosystem  in February . ATOM holders, however, opted to let Stargate run a bit longer and do further testing before enabling IBC. The vote put IBC into effect on Cosmos. There was no delay between the vote and the feature going live. ""Since it is a parameter change, it does not require for the chain to be halted,"" Milosevic explained. The activation of IBC is not enough for all blockchains to work in conjunction with each other, though. IBC is a protocol that other blockchains can use, but they must upgrade to the IBC standard. That is theoretically possible for  any blockchain to do , but those built on Tendermint, the  consensus model  native to the Cosmos ecosystem, are likely to be the first to adopt the standard. Some of the blockchains that are built on Tendermint include  Kava , Agoric, Akash,  Foam  and  Crypto.com . “It's like dropping a crystal into a supersaturated solution: The pent-up need for interconnection between chains will be unleashed,"" Dean Tribble, the CEO at  Agoric , told CoinDesk through a spokesperson. ""Some of the most interesting connections will be between chains that we have never heard of, accomplishing things not currently feasible.” Agoric is a secure smart contracts platform. It's not yet running in the wild, but its developers have tried IBC in tests. Open-source cloud services provider Akash and crypto-trading app Crypto.com both told CoinDesk that each is technically ready to join IBC and should do so in a matter of weeks, pending approval by their respective token holders. Mix and match Cosmos' funding came from a 2017 initial coin offering that raised $17 million to support a cross-blockchain future. Its war chest  appreciated dramatically  thanks to deft treasury management. The project had a variety of leadership changes through  a rocky 2020  but carried on. The website  Cosmos-Cap  estimates the combined market capitalization for the ecosystem’s blockchains at over $60 billion, led by Binance Coin, Terra, Crypto.com and Cosmos itself. ""Since IBC is modular by design, it can be easily extended to support more chains outside of the Tendermint ecosystem. For example, the modules needed to open IBC connections to the Polkadot and Kusama networks and other substrate based networks are under development,"" Milosevic wrote. Similarly, the venture fund  Multicoin Capital  recently released  a report  on one blockchain in the Cosmos ecosystem, Thorchain, a cross-chain decentralized exchange, in the same mold as  DeFi staple Uniswap . Multicoin's Tushar Jain wrote in an email to CoinDesk about Cosmos' latest upgrade:  ""It is a huge deal. Through things like IBC and Thorchain's bridge to non-Cosmos protocols and other bridges like Solana's wormhole bridge, we will see the cross-chain future come to life,” Jain said.

binance, Altcoin Watch , Exchange tokens rally ahead of next week’s Coinbase Nasdaq listing ,"Centralized cryptocurrency exchanges (CEX) have received increased attention over the past couple of months as excitement builds over Coinbase's April 14 NASDAQ listing and the exchange's recent announcement that it  pulled in $1.8 billion in revenue  during the first quarter of 2021.  Even as decentralized finance (DeFi) and popular decentralized exchanges (DEX) like Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (CAKE) attracted investors, high transaction costs and low liquidity on separate blockchain networks means that many crypto traders stick with CEXs for lower trading costs and the sense of security they offer.  While Bitcoin, DeFi tokens and a selection of altcoins have garnered most of the media's attention, exchange tokens have quietly amassed impressive gains over the past few months. KCS/USDT vs. BNB/USDT vs. WRX/USDT 1-day chart. Source:  TradingView Four exchange tokens that have seen significant gains of late are Binance Coin ( BNB ), KuCoin Token (KCS), FTX Token (FTT) and WazirX (WRX). BNB/USDT Binance continues to be the most dominant cryptocurrency exchange in the sector and that strength has been reflected in the growth of its native BNB token which has climbed 875% since Feb. 1 due in part to the rise of the Binance Smart Chain (BSC).  BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView As the Ethereum ( ETH ) network continues to struggle with congestion and high transaction costs, BSC emerged to capitalize on the situation by offering low-cost fixed transactions that are paid with BNB.  This added layer of functionality for BNB has significantly increased demand for the token as it powers the Binance DeFi ecosystem and PancakeSwap DEX which is now the fourth-largest DeFi platform by total value locked according to data from Defi Llama.  Total value locked on PancakeSwap. Source:  Defi Llama With signs that trading volumes across the cryptocurrency are on the rise, there is a strong possibility that BNB will see further upside as the Binance ecosystem continues to expand and the Etheruem network continues to face difficulties with scalability and high fees.  KCS/USDT KuCoin exchange was established in 2017 and operates out of the Seychelles. Similar to BNB, volumes for KuCoin Token (KCS) began to pick up in early February as the bull market began to gather steam.  KCS/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView Since Feb. 1, the price of KCS has increased nearly 1,000% from a low of $1.17 to a high of $12.96 on April 8, its highest price since January 2018.  The exchange has capitalized on the growth of DeFi by quickly listing popular and newly released tokens that would otherwise only be available on Uniswap and SushiSwap.  VORTECS™ data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  began to detect a bullish outlook for KCS on April 3, prior to the recent price rise.

FTT/USDT FTT is the native token for the FTX derivatives exchange which was launched in May 2019 by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang.  The token has received increased attention in 2021 partly due to its association with the Serum (SRM) decentralized exchange.  Since trading at a low of $5.68 on Jan. 2, the price of FTT has skyrocketed 750% to a new all-time high of $48.62 on April 8. FTT received an added boost on April 7 when FTX  announced  an official partnership with the National Basketball Association’s Miami Heat.  FTT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source:  TradingView As the FTX ecosystem grows by combining derivatives, centralized and decentralized finance offerings, FTT token could see further appreciation. The token's utility and integration to FTX is quite similar to that of BNB, leading some analysts to suggest that FTT is undervalued.  WRX/USDT WazirX is a cryptocurrency exchange based in India that claims to be the fastest-growing crypto exchange in the country. The project is part of the Binance ecosystem, which helped start the exchange throughthe launch of a $50 million ‘Blockchain for India’ fund in March 2020.  Compared to other exchange tokens, WRX has been a slower mover in 2021 and price action for the token didn’t really get moving until early April when the platform  revealed  that it would launch a  decentralized NFT marketplace .  Trading volume and token price for WRX began to pick up on March 29 when WRX traded around $0.50 and the subsequent announcement of the NFT marketplace on April 4 led to a surge in activity that lifted WRX price more than 1,200% to an all-time high of $6.65 on April 5.

binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin (BNB) market cap passes Santander and UBS — What’s next? ,"2021 has been an impressive year for Binance Coin ( BNB ), which so far has rallied by more than 900%.  One of the primary drivers of BNB's growth was continued congestion on the Ethereum network. As this struggle carried on, Binance Smart Chain (BSC) emerged as an alternative, meeting the rapidly growing decentralized finance (DeFi) sector's demands.  As BNB reached a $64 billion market capitalization, it has surpassed traditional banks, including Santander, the Bank of Montreal, and UBS. Meanwhile, some analysts point to the estimated value and impact of  Coinbase's upcoming direct listing ($100-billion valuation)  as a catalyst for the BNB price hike.  Binance financials are better than coinbase  $BNB Coinbase valuation 80-100 billion on NASDAQ listing  Quarterly burn  Can participate in  $TKO  launchpad  Can farm  $TLM  for 30 days  #BSC  ecosystem growing at a rapid pace  Estimated valuation for me is 80 bill+  Current = 62B — Yaz (@YazTrades)  April 6, 2021 
 
 A common narrative spun up over the past few weeks is that the direct listing of COIN is also adding value to centralized exchange tokens. Analysts are also speculating that other U.S.-based regulated exchanges like Kraken and Gemini will likely follow Coinbase's path and attempt to raise funds through a stock offering.  To understand BNB's potential, one must first understand the differences between equities (stocks). After this is cleared up, it will be possible to analyze the possible drivers of BNB's appreciation. BNB does not represent shares of Binance BNB token provides holders with a discount on trading fees, and it is required for those wishing to participate in Binance Launchpad token sales. As BNB gained liquidity, it also became a base pair for other cryptocurrencies at Binance exchange. Over time, other uses emerged as the Binance Smart Chain gained traction. For example, BNB can cover network fees and as serve as a utility token in the ecosystem, which includes decentralized apps (dApps) and games. Periodically  Binance burns (destroys) some of the non-circulating BNB tokens  based on the exchange's overall trading volume. This strategy's efficacy vanished over time as investors understood that these destroyed tokens never entered the circulating supply. The Binance Smart Chain network uses a Proof of Stake Authority which eliminates the need for miners or expensive transaction fees. The platform kept its compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and has a similar token and smart contract structure. Many tokenized (or pegged) cryptocurrencies have gained relevance in Binance's networks, allowing users to bypass miner fees. Another benefit provided by Binance Smart Chain's BEP-20 model is staking and farming capabilities in its vast network of decentralized applications, including the PancakeSwap DEX and Venus lending platform. Decentralized Finance Total Value Locked ranking. Source: DeBank As shown above,  Binance Smart Chain has been gaining ground on other DeFi  protocols in terms of total value locked. Thus, new use cases for the BNB token emerged to take center stage as farming, liquidity pools, and base pairs utilized the token throughout the network. Banks are reliable dividend providers, but DeFi could overtake the system Equity shareholders are entitled to a piece of a listed companies' net earnings. This amount will vary between each quarter, as the board of directors may opt to repay debt or incorporate some of that money into reserves. However, banks are known cash cows and thus usually a reliable source of dividends payouts. Santander (SAN) dividends paid over the last 12 months divided by the current stock price yield a 3.7% gain, and Bank of Montreal (BMO) shareholders received a similar yield. Switzerland-based UBS yields went down in 2020, but historically it has averaged 5%. Bank shareholders effectively have voting rights in shareholders meetings, and minority groups could block measures that would hurt them financially. On the other hand, these equity holders are 100% dependent on the bank's net income and growth. BNB, on the other hand, could survive without the direct influence of Binance exchange. In the future, if Binance Smart Chain achieves independent developers and validators, its ecosystem might continue to thrive. In theory, if token loses its dependency as the ecosystem grows, becoming less centralized. If done correctly, BNB's market capitalization could surpass that of the entire traditional banking system, but before this can happen these networks and decentralized applications need to gain adoption and prove that they can stand up to the needs of mainstream investors and banking clients.

binance, News , Messari researchers slam Binance Smart Chain over centralized validators ,"Despite Binance supporters celebrating Binance Coin’s ( BNB ) chart-topping performance for Q1 2021, concerns are growing regarding the centralization of the Binance ecosystem. On Monday, Messari researcher Ryan Watkins took aim at the centralization of  Binance Smart Chain ’s validators, stating: “Every cycle people get hoodwinked by the latest centralized solution to all blockchains problems.” “Every cycle influencers pump these narratives so they can dump on naïve retail traders when it’s over.” BSC uses proof-of-staked authority consensus, with its 21 active validators being chosen daily by Binance Chain — a network that is governed by just 11 validators. BSC validators stake BNB. “It’s hard not to presume that each Binance Chain validator is in some way connected or tied to Binance,” Messari’s Wilson Withiam speculated, adding: “They each take turns producing blocks in a seemingly predefined order. There doesn’t appear to be any stake-weighted mechanism to determine which one produces the next block.” Some might overlook the influence Binance Chain has over Binance Smart Chain's validator set. BSC has 21 active validators, making it more centralized than most platforms. This validator set is determined daily by Binance Chain, a network managed by just 11 validators.  pic.twitter.com/UeWDj0o1DY — Wilson Withiam (@WilsonWithiam)  April 12, 2021 
 
 Watkins sought to address perceived misconceptions regarding BSC’s performance, asserting its speed advantages over the Ethereum mainnet are a product of “the magic of centralization” rather than “technological innovation.”  “BSC is an Ethereum fork with a centralized validator set. That’s it. Nothing more,” he added. “If you really think BSC has achieved smart contract supremacy, and will become the world’s settlement layer, you are on crack.” However, Twitter-user Earoshthime  rebutted  the claim from Watkins and others that BSC offers little more than clones of Ethereum-based DeFi legos, describing copying as inherent to technological innovation. “When it comes to invention & innovation, copying is a feature not a bug. Copying is a sign that something there is worth exploring but it only takes one character difference to be better,” they said.  Twitter user Maurice K Taylo also responded in defense of BSC,  describing  Ethereum’s recent high fees and scaling woes as driving users away to seek out alternative protocols. Etherium needs to hurry and solve their scaling probablem that's causing ridiculously high fees. These fees are taking too much out of peoples pockets. At some point people care more about their money than Defi. — maurice k taylor (@mkt92z)  April 12, 2021

binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin reaches 37% of Ethereum’s market cap: 3 reasons why BNB is soaring ,"Binance Coin ( BNB ), the native cryptocurrency of Binance Chain and top digital asset exchange Binance, is starting to close in on Ether ( ETH ) in market capitalization.  As of Monday, BNB is  valued at $87 billion  at the price of just under $600. The valuation of Ether is hovering at around $246 billion, which is 2.8 times larger than that of Binance Coin. $BNB  volume >  $BTC  volume. Congrats  @Binance   @cz_binance    pic.twitter.com/vLkdGBnnIt — Joe Grech (@JoeBGrech)  April 12, 2021 
 
 The technical momentum of BNB has been so strong that it briefly surpassed the volume of the BTC/USDT pair on Binance. This trend is significant because Tether ( USDT ) is the biggest stablecoin in the global market, and the BTC/USDT pair is one of the most liquid trading pairs in crypto. Why is Binance Coin surging so hard? Binance Coin has been rising due to the three key reasons: an overall uptick in the popularity of Binance Smart Chain, strong technical momentum and the gap between BSC and Ethereum projects. Binance Smart Chain transaction volume. Source: BSCScan.io In recent weeks, the transaction volume on Binance Smart Chain has tripled the volume of the Ethereum blockchain. Particularly in Southeast Asia, the usage of Binance Smart Chain has been rising, according to Coin98, the biggest venture capital firm in Vietnam that is building a DeFi ecosystem targeted at Asia. Considering that the price of BNB was much lower than Ether until late March, this discrepancy between BNB and ETH likely made BNB a compelling trade. There is also a big gap in valuations between the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem and Binance Smart Chain, which has been fueling a large portion of the demand for BSC projects. This has caused the value of BNB to rapidly rise over the past two weeks, while ETH has been relatively stable at just over $2,000. A journalist who covers crypto in China known as “Wu Blockchain”  explained : “BNB broke through an astonishing $600, but Ethereum’s Fees fell to its lowest point in a month. Although the transaction volume of BSC is 3x that of Ethereum, the two are not in a competitive relationship. The top 10 addresses of BNB hold more than 88%, and Eth is 20%. The future of Ethereum depends on the upgrade of EIP-1559 and 2.0. The only two things Binance needs to worry about are the government suppression and hackers.” Traders foresee BNB to undergo a more explosive rally in the foreseeable future if it breaks out against Bitcoin. Kaleo, a pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader,  said : “$BNB breaking above this level on the $BTC pair could lead to the type of explosive momentum needed to actually close in on $1,000.” BSC/BTC 1-day price chart (Binance). Source: TradingView.com, Kaleo Will the capital rotate back into Ethereum? However, Kelvin Koh, the managing partner at Spartan Group — one of the largest DeFi-focused funds in Asia — said that for now, he expects the capital to rotate back into Ethereum as BSC projects near the valuation of ETH equivalents. He emphasized that there is a huge valuation gap between BSC and Ethereum projects. This gap could be making BSC projects compelling to the market. He said: “BSC is having its own DeFi summer....so much alpha to be discovered in BSC ($XVS, $CAKE). If you are wondering why Ethereum DeFi coins are lacklustre, it’s because of the huge valuation gap that still exists between the BSC coins and ETH equivalents. Until this gap closes, money isn’t rotating back to ETH DeFi coins.”",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-coin-reaches-37-of-ethereum-s-market-cap-3-reasons-why-bnb-is-soaring,cointelegraph,2021-04-12,00:00:00,en,589,3480,4.877758913412563,233,0.39558573853989815,binance coin bnb native cryptocurrency binance chain top digital asset exchange binance starting ether eth market capitalization bnb valued valuation ether hovering time larger binance coin bnb volume btc volume congrats binance cz binance pic twitter vlkdgbnnit grech joebgrech technical momentum bnb briefly surpassed volume btc usdt pair binance trend significant tether usdt biggest stablecoin global market btc usdt pair liquid trading pair crypto binance coin surging hard binance coin rising due reason uptick popularity binance chain technical momentum gap bsc ethereum project binance chain transaction volume source bscscan io recent transaction volume binance chain tripled volume ethereum blockchain southeast usage binance chain rising coin biggest venture capital firm vietnam building defi ecosystem targeted bnb ether late discrepancy bnb eth made bnb compelling trade big gap valuation ethereum defi ecosystem binance chain fueling portion demand bsc project caused bnb rapidly rise past eth stable journalist cover crypto blockchain explained bnb broke astonishing ethereum fee lowest point transaction volume bsc ethereum competitive relationship top address bnb hold eth future ethereum depends upgrade eip thing binance worry government suppression hacker trader foresee bnb undergo explosive rally foreseeable future break bitcoin kaleo pseudonymous cryptocurrency trader bnb breaking level btc pair lead type explosive momentum needed bsc btc chart binance source tradingview kaleo capital rotate ethereum koh managing partner spartan group largest defi focused fund expects capital rotate ethereum bsc project valuation eth equivalent emphasized huge valuation gap bsc ethereum project gap making bsc project compelling market bsc defi discovered bsc xv cake wondering ethereum defi coin lacklustre huge valuation gap exists bsc coin eth equivalent gap close rotating eth defi coin,0.08784722222222223,positive,0.4072916666666666,"{'neg': 0.038, 'neu': 0.852, 'pos': 0.11, 'compound': 0.9517}",0.9517,0.038,0.852,0.11,positive,-0.09090908264462885,0.04247104230706161,negative

binance, Market Analysis , Record $600M BNB burn suggests Binance made $750M in profit in Q1 ,"Binance Coin ( BNB ) saw its 15th burn to date on Friday. According to on-chain data, Binance burned nearly $600 million worth of BNB tokens.  Historically, Binance has burned around 20% of the exchange’s profits. But in the last burn, Binance burned much more than 20%, and the exact percentage of the burn remains uncertain. Imagine burning half a billion dollars, wait, don’t imagine. It’s real.  #BNB   https://t.co/rMFbiufFSG — CZ  Binance (@cz_binance)  April 16, 2021 
 
 BNB fundamentals keep improving Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX — one of the top cryptocurrency futures exchanges alongside Binance — estimated that Binance possibly generated $1 billion in revenue in the first quarter of this year. By contrast, the total lifetime profits of Coinbase — which was listed on Nasdaq this week — are  estimated  to be somewhere between $780 million and $1.3 billion. Bankman-Fried, commonly known as SBF,  said : “So, TL;DR, with a factor of ~1.5 or so uncertainty: Binance, Q1 2021: a) $1B rev, $750m profit --> $4B rev, $3B profit run-rate b) Blended average fee rate ~0.016% on trades c) They’re making it really clear that burn only goes until 100m tokens, but 60% of rev until then.” Although Binance burned 20% of the exchange’s profit in the past, it is possible that Binance burned 70%–80% of the profit in its latest burn. Considering this trend, Bankman-Fried said that the $600-million burn could equate to around $750 million in profit.  He added: “Based on the original specs, BNB was going to burn 20% of profit. Based on this  update , it’s now unclear what they’ll burn, but maybe something like: 80% of profit (up to 100m tokens, and nothing after that. Binance burned $600m of BNB for Q1. That would roughly imply $750m of profit. If we assume $1B of revenue, given their $6T of volume in Q1, that implies an average fee rate of 0.016% or so.” Since March 27,  the  price of BNB has rallied 180%  from $233 to as high as $640. The rally closed the gap between BNB and Ether ( ETH ), with BNB now comprising over a third of Ether’s market capitalization. The strong uptrend of BNB was influenced by the strong performance of Binance and its derivatives exchange, but also the upward trajectory of Binance Smart Chain. In recent months, Binance Smart Chain has seen a significant increase in daily transaction volume. According to BSCScan, the blockchain explorer for Binance Smart Chain, the blockchain network saw the number of daily transactions rise from around 380,000 in late January to over 4.7 million as of Friday.

binance, Altcoin Watch , Binance Coin regains 20% in a day: Why is BNB seeing such a strong recovery? ,"The price of Binance Coin ( BNB ), the native cryptocurrency of Binance and Binance Smart Chain, rallied by more than 20% in the last 24 hours.  BNB/USDT 15-minute price chart (Binance). Source: TradingView The swift recovery comes after a market-wide correction on Sunday, during which major cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) saw a sharp decline.  ETH’s price, for instance, declined from $2,400 to as low as $1,900  in a sudden pullback  as Bitcoin plunged below the $60,000 support level to as low as $52,000.  Overheated futures market gets a reset The market saw a steep pullback in a short period because the futures market was  extremely overheated .  Over $10 billion worth of cryptocurrency positions were liquidated on a single day, with Bitcoin accounting for over $5 billion of it.   Since the drop was more technical than fundamental and it was a cascade of liquidations that caused the pullback, the market pared most of the losses relatively quickly. It was also evident that the futures market led the correction because the price of major cryptocurrencies was trading lower in the futures market than the spot market.  Adam Cochran, a partner at Cinneamhain Ventures,  explained : “I think what we saw was a cascade of tightly wound retail positions on a weekend market, get toppled, but somewhere along the line, there was a matching book fail that caused stop-losses to not get hit and when that happened it put a massive $63M position in jeopardy.”  He added that the liquidation of a $63-million position shocked the market, which put even the major cryptocurrencies at risk of a speedy drop.  Cochran added: “That $63M position getting liquidated is what put the market in major jeopardy, but by that time there was already degraded performance issues connecting to Binance and spiking gas fees. So there was very little way for anyone to backstop or arbitrage that liquidation.”  BNB fundamentals remain strong  After the initial futures market-driven drop, cryptocurrencies with strong fundamentals began to recover first.  While Bitcoin and Ether rebounded relatively quickly by 12% and 15% from their respective lows, BNB outperformed both BTC and ETH within the past 24 hours in its recovery.  The strong performance of BNB stems from two positive catalysts: the record $600-million BNB burn by Binance and the uptrend of Binance Smart Chain metrics.  On Friday, Cointelegraph  reported  that Binance burned $600 million worth of BNB in the first quarter of 2021, which reduces the circulating supply and suggests the exchange generated at least $750 million in quarterly profit.  Moreover, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao emphasized on Sunday that the Binance team has no plans to sell its BNB holdings — 40% of the total supply — in a likely dig at Coinbase insiders  reportedly selling $5 billion worth of COIN shares  last week.  #Binance  team had an allocation of 40% of the total supply of  #BNB  from the ICO days, which is worth just over $37 billion dollars at today's (dropped) prices. We have not sold a single  #BNB  so far, and never intend to. We will burn it all. More info:  https://t.co/6YM7O7vqDZ — CZ  Binance (@cz_binance)  April 18, 2021 
 
 Thus, when the market started to recover, BNB saw a stronger rally possibly as a result of a delayed response to the $600-million burn.  Atop the token burn, the daily number of transactions on Binance Smart Chain surpassed 5 million.  Binance Smart Chain number of transactions.

Traders were ready to buy the dip A pseudonymous trader known as Altcoin Psycho stated that traders were ready to buy the dip in the altcoin market. He  said : “Traders were ready to buy the dip. Was anticipating a market dip all week, yet I got lazy and did a bad job positioning myself for success. Had 10+ alts on my list, only set bids for eth. Thankfully experienced minimal drawdown tonight, but still really played this opportunity poorly. Good learning lesson here.” The quick inflow of capital into the altcoin market shortly after the dip led many altcoins to recover swiftly, which likely catalyzed BNB’s upsurge.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-coin-regains-20-in-a-day-why-is-bnb-seeing-such-a-strong-recovery,cointelegraph,2021-04-19,00:00:00,en,712,4308,4.995786516853933,262,0.36797752808988765,binance coin bnb native cryptocurrency binance binance chain rallied hour bnb usdt minute chart binance source tradingview recovery market wide correction cryptocurrencies including bitcoin btc ether eth decline eth instance declined sudden pullback bitcoin plunged support level overheated future market reset market steep pullback period future market extremely overheated cryptocurrency position liquidated single bitcoin accounting drop technical fundamental cascade liquidation caused pullback market pared loss quickly evident future market led correction cryptocurrencies trading future market spot market partner cinneamhain venture explained cascade tightly wound retail position weekend market toppled line matching fail caused stop loss hit happened put massive position jeopardy added liquidation position shocked market put cryptocurrencies risk speedy drop added position liquidated put market jeopardy time degraded performance issue connecting binance spiking gas fee backstop arbitrage liquidation bnb fundamental remain initial future market driven drop cryptocurrencies fundamental began recover bitcoin ether rebounded quickly respective low bnb outperformed btc eth past hour recovery performance bnb stem positive catalyst record bnb burn binance uptrend binance chain metric cointelegraph reported binance burned bnb reduces circulating supply suggests exchange generated profit binance ceo changpeng emphasized binance team plan bnb holding total supply dig coinbase insider reportedly selling coin share binance team allocation total supply bnb ico day dollar today dropped price sold single bnb intend burn info http ym vqdz cz binance cz binance market started recover bnb stronger rally possibly result delayed response burn atop token burn number transaction binance chain surpassed binance chain number transaction source bscscan bnb native token binance chain blockchain network rising user activity positively affect bnb contributing recovery trader buy dip pseudonymous trader altcoin psycho stated trader buy dip altcoin market trader buy dip anticipating market dip lazy bad job positioning success alt list set bid eth thankfully experienced minimal drawdown tonight played opportunity poorly learning lesson inflow capital altcoin market shortly dip led altcoins recover swiftly catalyzed bnb upsurge,-0.05130884740259739,negative,0.43740192099567093,"{'neg': 0.111, 'neu': 0.787, 'pos': 0.102, 'compound': -0.3182}",-0.3182,0.111,0.787,0.102,neutral,-0.18918918407596802,0.12457912415966625,negative
binance, Altcoin Watch , Exchange tokens bounce from key support levels as COIN looks for direction ,"A lot of hype was built up before the Coinbase  listing  on the Nasdaq on April 14 and several cryptocurrencies rallied in the run-up to the event.  However, traders usually buy the rumor and sell the news. In this case, they bought until the event, and then several investors seem to have  booked  profits aggressively. This resulted in a correction in several major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin ( BTC ). Crypto market data daily view. Source:   Coin360 In the run-up to the Coinbase listing, several  exchange tokens rallied  as traders bid up their price in relation to Coinbase's $100 billion valuation. Now that COIN has been trading on Nasdaq for nearly a week, let's take a look at how exchange tokens are performing since the listing. BNB/USDT Binance Coin ( BNB ) was quoting at $256.72 on Feb. 19 and from there, it rallied to an all-time high at $638.56 on April 12, giving 148.73% returns to investors.  VORTECS™ data from Cointelegraph Markets Pro began to detect a bullish outlook for BNB on April 2, before the rally picked up momentum. The VORTECS™ Score, exclusive to Cointelegraph, is an algorithmic comparison of historic and current market conditions derived from a combination of data points including market sentiment, trading volume, recent price movements and Twitter activity. VORTECS™ Score (green) vs.BNB price. Source:  Cointelegraph Markets Pro As seen from the one-month chart above, the VORTECS™ Score for BNB flipped green on April 2 when the price was close to $335.  Barring small periods, the VORTECS™ Score remained in the green all through the rally to $601 on April 13. Thus the indicator could have assisted traders in sticking with the rally even while other analytical methods may have warned of overbought levels. The coin witnessed profit booking above $600 and corrected to the 20-day exponential moving average ($463) on April 18. However, a positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to hang below the 20-day EMA.  BNB/USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView Both moving averages continue to slope up and the relative strength index (RSI) is above 68, indicating that the bulls are in control. Buyers may face resistance at $600 but if they can clear this hurdle, the BNB/USDT pair could march up to $638.56. The bears will again try to stall the uptrend in the $600 to $638.56 zone. If the price turns down from this zone, it could once again dip to $428 and the pair may remain range-bound for a few days. However, if the bulls drive the price above the all-time high, the pair could pick up momentum and rally toward $832. This bullish view will invalidate if the bears sink and sustain the price below $428. Such a move will suggest that supply exceeds demand and that could pull the price down to $348.69.  FTT/USDT FTX Token (FTT) rallied from $28.82 on Feb. 19 to an all-time high at $59.59 on April 14, clocking gains of 106.76%. Since then, the token has been in a corrective phase but the positive sign is that the bulls have not allowed the price to sustain below the 20-day EMA ($48.70). This suggests strong buying on dips. The news of the FTX exchange burning over  $6.4 million  worth of FTT, $2 million more than their previous record, is likely to attract buyers as it shows the exchange has been doing robust business. As more tokens are burned, the supply will reduce and with increasing demand, the price is likely to move higher. FTT/USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView If the bulls can push the price above $52.55, the FTT/USDT pair could rally to $59.59. If the bulls can thrust the price above this resistance, the momentum is likely to pick up and the pair could rally to $71.89. However, if the bulls fail to propel the price above $52.55, it will suggest that demand dries up at higher levels. That could strengthen the bears and they will then try to sink the price to the 50-day simple moving average ($41.32).  This is an important support to watch out for because the price has not closed below it since mid-November of last year. Therefore, a break below it will suggest a change in trend and open the gates for a deeper correction to $32. HT/USDT Huobi Token (HT) was trading at $18.94 on Feb. 19 and from there it moved up to an all-time high at $26.89 on Feb. 20, but since then, it has not been able to come close to the level.  The token witnessed a sharp correction after hitting the all-time high and it dropped to an intraday low at $12.13 on March 25, losing about 55% from the highs.  HT/USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView Generally, after a deep fall the price consolidates in a range before starting the next trending move. The same thing happened with the HT/USDT pair as well. The pair traded between $12.13 and $18 until the bulls pushed the price above the resistance on April 10.  However, the bulls could not sustain the breakout as the price turned down from $22.76 on April 12 and re-entered the range on April 18.  The bulls are trying to defend the 50-day SMA ($16) but are struggling to sustain the price above $18. This shows selling at higher levels. If the price turns down and breaks below the 50-day SMA, the pair could drop to $12.13 where buyers may step in. Contrary to this assumption, if the bulls can sustain the price above $18, the pair could rally to $22.76. A break above this resistance could challenge $26.89. The bulls will have to clear this resistance to resume the uptrend. OKB/USDT OKEx ( OKB ) jumped up from $12.50 on Feb. 19 to an all-time high at $24.74 on April 12, a gain of 98%. However, it was not a one-way move but a roller coaster ride for the investors. The coin had hit an intraday high at $23.80 on Feb. 22 but it witnessed a sharp fall and dipped to $12 on March 25, losing about 50% from the highs. However, instead of forming a range, the price quickly started a V-shaped recovery. OKB/USDT daily chart. Source:  TradingView Although the bulls cleared the $23.80 hurdle on April 12, they could not sustain the higher levels. The OKB/USDT pair again witnessed a sharp decline and hit an intraday low at $13.92 on April 18. The bulls are currently attempting to start a relief rally but have hit a wall at the 20-day EMA ($17.98). This suggests the sentiment has turned negative and traders are selling on rallies. If the price turns down and breaks below $14, the pair could drop to $12.  A break below this level could intensify the selling and the pair could drop to $8. The 20-day EMA has started to turn down and the RSI is just below the midpoint, suggesting a slight advantage to the bears. This negative view will invalidate if the bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA. Above this resistance, the pair could move up to the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level at $20.60. This level is again likely to act as stiff resistance but if it is scaled the pair could retest $24.74.

binance,Markets,Binance's Tesla Stock Token May Have Raised Regulatory Red Flags: Report,"Binance’s marketing campaign to citizens in Hong Kong for its security token representing Tesla stock may be a violation of local securities regulations, according to a prominent local news outlet. Inducing the public to purchase securities is a regulated activity that requires a license from the city’s top financial watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), Gaven Cheong, a partner at law firm Simmons & Simmons,  told  the South China Morning Post on Wednesday. Binance does not appear to have secured a license to market or trade security tokens in the region, according to the report.   Binance, one of the largest crypto exchanges by volume,  launched  its Binance stock token on April 12. This new service allows its users to buy fractions of companies’ shares with digital tokens. The zero-commission tokens qualifies holders for returns including dividends.  The users can purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular stock. Such transactions can only be settled by Binance USD (BUSD), a U.S. dollar stablecoin issued by the exchange. The underlying stocks are in  the custody of a third-party brokerage company, according to Binance’s website. It is unclear which brokerage firm is the custodian and where it is located.   The posting of announcements that advertise a security token could be seen as an invitation amounting to “dealing” in securities, the report said. The SFC considers security tokens “likely to be securities,” according to its  statement  regarding security tokens in March 2019.  Binance had not responded to requests for comments by press time.  The first stock token issued by Binance is backed by electric car maker Tesla’s shares. Binance also added tokens representing Coinbase’s $COIN stock after the exchange went public in the U.S. last week.

The Bitcoin dominance index, which measures BTC’s market capitalization relative to the broader cryptocurrency market,  reached  a low of 49.35% on Thursday, according to CoinMarketCap. At the beginning of 2021, BTC dominance was 70.68%.  Ether ( ETH ), meanwhile, accounted for nearly 15% of the overall market at its peak on Thursday. ETH dominance is up nearly 4 percentage points since the start of 2021.  ETH has outperformed BTC over the past seven days, charting an impressive 9.5% return. The second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap is down 10% from its  previous all-time high , whereas Bitcoin has corrected over 20%.  Binance Coin ( BNB ) has also seen its share of the overall market grow steadily this year, from 0.71% on Jan. 1 to 4.17% on April 25. BNB is being  supported by several fundamental factors , including growing adoption of the Binance platform and a coordinated burn of $600 million worth of tokens in the first quarter.  Meanwhile, cryptocurrencies outside the top 10 have seen their share of the overall market inflate from less than 11% to over 18% since Jan. 1.  Cryptocurrency market capitalization dominance.

binance,Markets,"Microsoft, Apple, MicroStrategy to Be Listed on Binance as Tokenized Stocks","Cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance is looking to tokenize more stocks of some of the world's largest companies. According to a  blog post  on Monday, Binance will list MicroStrategy, Microsoft and Apple, providing Binance users with exposure via the tokenization of equities. The tokens are expected to be denominated in the exchange's stablecoin, BUSD. The move means Binance users will be able to qualify for economic returns on the underlying shares, which will include potential dividends. The tokens also allow Binance customers to purchase as little as one-hundredth of a regular stock using BUSD. Binance's stock tokens are tokenized equities that can be traded on traditional stock exchanges. Each tokenized stock represents one ordinary share of the stock and is backed by a depository portfolio of underlying securities held by CM-Equity AG, Germany, according to the post.

binance, News , $50M reportedly stolen from BSC-based Uranium Finance ,"Uranium Finance, an automated market maker platform on the Binance Smart Chain, has reported a security incident that resulted in a loss of about $50 million. Tweeting  on Wednesday, Uranium revealed that the exploit targeted its v2.1 token migration event and that the team was in contact with the Binance security team to mitigate the situation. (1/2)‼️ Uranium migration has been exploited, the following address has 50m in it  The only thing that matters is keeping the funds on BSC, everyone please start tweeting this address to Binance immediately asking them to stop transfers. — Uranium Finance (@UraniumFinance)  April 28, 2021 
 
 The hacker reportedly took advantage of bugs in Uranium’s balance modifier logic that inflated the project’s balance by a factor of 100. This error reportedly allowed the attacker to steal $50 million from the project. As of the time of writing, the contract created by the hacker still  holds  $36.8 million in Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Binance USD (BUSD). The remaining stolen funds include 80 Bitcoin ( BTC ), 1,800 Ether ( ETH ), 26,500 Polkadot (DOT), 5.7 million Tether ( USDT ), as well as 638,000 Cardano ( ADA ) and 112,000 u92, the project's native coin.  Details from BscScan show the attacker swapping the ADA and DOT tokens for ETH, upping the Ether stash to about 2,400 ETH. Meanwhile, the alleged mastermind of the theft has already moved 2,400 ETH, worth about $5.7 million, using the Ethereum privacy tool Tornado Cash. Data  from Ethereum chain monitoring service Etherscan shows the funds moving in 100 ETH sums, with the cross-chain decentralized exchange bridge AnySwap used to migrate funds from BSC to the Ethereum network. Source: Etherscan According to Uranium, the project has reached out to the Binance security team to prevent the hacker from moving more funds out of the BSC ecosystem. Binance did not immediately respond to Cointelegraph’s request for comment. A spokesperson for Uranium revealed that the bug was yet to be patched and that users have been advised to stop providing liquidity on the project and to cash out their funds. The team also created a Telegram group for victims of the hack while promising to provide updates on the progress being made to recover the stolen funds. Wednesday’s hack is the second attack on the Uranium project in quick succession. Earlier in April, hackers exploited one of the platform’s pools, stealing about  $1.3 million  worth of BUSD and BNB. Indeed, the incident led to the first migration to v2 less than two weeks ago. In a previous  announcement , the Uranium developer team said that multiple entities had audited its v2 contracts and that it had learned from its previous mistakes. Meanwhile, speculation is rife as to whether the attack was an inside job, given the sudden decision to engineer another version upgrade barely 11 days after completing the v2 migration. Today  @UraniumFinance  got rekt. The Uranium devs had just deployed v2 of their contracts, and 11 days later they asked everyone to migrate to v2.1. Pretty odd timing for an upgrade, right?  Here's how the bug worked. ⬇️ — Kyle ""1B TVL"" Kistner | Fulcrum | bZx (@BeTheb0x)  April 28, 2021 
 
 Hacks associated with smart contract bugs are commonplace within the decentralized finance arena even for fully audited projects — as was the case with MonsterSlayer Finance earlier in April. Back in March, Meerkat, a Yearn.finance clone on the BSC, reportedly “exit-scammed” its users,  stealing $31 million in the process . Days later, the project’s developer team revealed  the alleged “rug pull” was a test  while outlining plans to return the funds. TurtleDex, another BSC-based project, also exit-scammed shortly after its launch,  draining over 9,000 BNB tokens  raised during the pre-sale.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/50m-reportedly-stolen-from-bsc-based-uranium-finance,cointelegraph,2021-04-28,00:00:00,en,620,3785,5.062903225806451,215,0.3467741935483871,uranium finance automated market maker platform binance chain reported security incident resulted loss tweeting uranium revealed exploit targeted token migration event team contact binance security team mitigate situation uranium migration exploited address thing matter keeping fund bsc start tweeting address binance immediately stop transfer uranium finance uraniumfinance reportedly advantage bug uranium balance modifier logic inflated project balance factor error reportedly allowed attacker steal project time writing contract created hold binance coin bnb binance usd busd remaining stolen fund include bitcoin btc ether eth polkadot tether usdt cardano project native coin detail bscscan show attacker swapping token eth upping ether stash eth alleged mastermind theft moved eth ethereum privacy tool tornado data ethereum chain monitoring service etherscan show fund moving eth sum chain decentralized exchange anyswap migrate fund bsc ethereum network source etherscan uranium project reached binance security team prevent moving fund bsc ecosystem binance immediately respond cointelegraph request comment spokesperson uranium revealed bug patched user advised stop providing liquidity project fund team created telegram group victim promising provide update progress made recover stolen fund attack uranium project succession earlier hacker exploited platform pool stealing busd bnb incident led migration ago previous announcement uranium developer team multiple entity audited contract learned previous mistake speculation attack inside job sudden decision engineer version upgrade barely day completing migration today uraniumfinance rekt uranium devs deployed contract day asked migrate pretty odd timing upgrade bug worked tvl kistner fulcrum bzx betheb hack contract bug commonplace decentralized finance fully audited project monsterslayer finance earlier meerkat yearn finance clone bsc reportedly exit scammed user stealing process day project developer team revealed alleged rug pull test outlining plan return fund turtledex bsc based project exit scammed shortly launch draining bnb token raised pre,-0.019642857142857146,negative,0.30238095238095236,"{'neg': 0.162, 'neu': 0.756, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.9833}",-0.9833,0.162,0.756,0.082,negative,-0.7499999687500013,0.08791208759006561,negative
binance,Markets,Forbes' Would-Be Acquirer Outlines Blockchain Media Strategy,"The takeaway Patrick McConlogue’s Borderless Services is offering $700 million to buy Forbes. McConlogue has a grand vision to reinvent media using crypto wallets, tokens and radio transmitters. But first he has to close a deal and is bidding against a SPAC for the 104-year-old property. There are at least two competing bids to buy out storied chronicler of capitalism Forbes Media LLC. It’s a competitive race that speaks to the disruption reshaping the current media landscape, as well as an increasingly frothy financial ecosystem where new economic models – from novel cryptocurrencies to less-traditional investment strategies – are making their presence known.  Reuters  reported last week  that Forbes’ owners are considering a bid from tech investor Michael Moe, who would merge the media giant with an unnamed special purpose acquisition company (SPAC). Also reported was a $700 million offer from Patrick McConlogue’s Borderless Services Inc., a crypto-focused investment vehicle.  In an interview with CoinDesk, McConlogue outlined new details of his proposal, including the cryptocurrency features he would embed in Forbes, as well as his grander ambitions for a media empire powered by blockchain technology.  “The Forbes asset is not our primary target. It's the first stop on our acquisition strategy,” McConlogue said in an interview. “Media is ripe for change, just like banking is ripe for change.”  Cryptocurrencies are the way to reshape both, he said.  McConlogue’s bid comes as crypto explodes into global prominence. Distributed technologies offer new ways to model trust, build economic units and finance deals; it’s possible cryptocurrencies could follow everywhere money flows. Though the sector promises much, it often underdelivers in practice.  McConlogue said his offer is “fully capitalized,” meaning Borderless is in the position to immediately buy out Forbes’ owners, Integrated Whale Media Investments (which purchased 95% of the company in 2014) and the Forbes family (which owns the remaining 5%).  The deal would be financed with debt and equity arranged by private equity firm Ares Management Corp. McConlogue has a background in traditional finance, including a stint as an engineer at  storied hedge fund  Citadel, experience he leveraged to gain access to a “deep equity table of long‑term, legacy members of Wall Street.”  See also:  Binance Drops Defamation Lawsuit Against Forbes Over ‘Tai Chi’ Document Neither Forbes nor Ares responded to CoinDesk’s requests for comment by press time. Integrated Whale could not be reached for comment. It is unclear how far along discussions are – there is no guarantee Forbes would accept any offer. McConlogue said the $700 million valuation is fair for a magazine that claims 6 million readers and reached 140 million people on the web. It was valued last at  $475 million in 2014. jwplayer(""jw-video-HL2P33aw"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/HL2P33aw""}) Crypto media empire In addition to making a bid for Forbes, McConlogue said he plans to acquire a number of “cable networks and print media.” These deals would also be financed through Ares, McConlogue said. The endgame is to bring awareness of cryptocurrencies to readers and viewers interested in traditional finance.   “That is because the demographic that's untouched here is still, you know, the people who are opening up a magazine,” he said. McConlogue said he would change the scope of Forbes’ coverage to focus on “news of the future of finance.” (Forbes, it should be noted, already has a crypto and blockchain news wing, with  CoinDesk alum   Michael del Castillo  among its writers.)  This widened scope would include more dedicated reporting on crypto, robo-trading and quantitative trading: “Things like that, where the world is changing quickly and markets are changing without news,” McConlogue said. He would keep Forbes' popular list products, such as 30 Under 30.  Further, a Borderless-owned Forbes would boast a one-click crypto wallet integration, such as with MetaMask, that would feature prominently in a reader’s browsing experience. Readers might receive token disbursements for finishing articles, commenting or sharing over social media channels, similar to media site Decrypt’s experimental app. Each publication under Borderless’ remit would issue its own token, McConlogue said. (Token-supported journalism has been tried before, by the defunct ConsenSys-backed startup  Civil  and more recently the  Brick House collective .) The protocol Borderless Services is “a skunkworks project” that has developed a “technology that changes the way that people consume information,” McConlogue said.  Details were scant and McConlogue asked to go off the record at times, but he said he’s building a “wireless protocol” called Overline that can operate offline across blockchains. It sounded like Polkadot meets  mesh networks . McConlogue has a background in computer science. While in his early 20s he made headlines for teaching  a homeless man  how to code. Crunchbase cites him as a core developer at  Block Collider , an interoperable blockchain project funded through a 2017  initial coin offering .  It’s unclear if Block Collider and Borderless are related, though McConlogue said he has hired an in-house team of 17 developers, plus several contractors, to work on technological breakthroughs, including what he calls “attention mining.”  See also:  Opinion – Crypto Is Still the Frontier for Journalism In all, the Borderless media empire would eventually involve a host of radio transmitters, and an antenna atop a New York skyscraper, to allow global crypto transactions “without ever touching the internet,” McConlogue said.  If all this sounds ambitious if not fanciful, McConlogue said it begins with baby steps. His first tenth of a  BTC  was mined with a  Raspberry Pi , he said. The plan now is to make just one acquisition, then many. One node, then many. That is, if Forbes’ owners buy his story.   jwplayer(""jw-video-YZRTal3B"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/YZRTal3B""})",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/05/04/forbes-would-be-acquirer-outlines-blockchain-media-strategy/,coindesk,2021-05-04,22:36:00,en,921,6095,5.575461454940283,316,0.34310532030401736,takeaway mcconlogue borderless service offering buy mcconlogue grand vision reinvent medium crypto wallet token radio transmitter bidding spac property competing bid buy storied chronicler capitalism medium llc competitive disruption reshaping current medium landscape increasingly frothy financial ecosystem economic model cryptocurrencies traditional investment strategy making presence reuters reported owner bid tech investor merge medium giant unnamed special purpose acquisition company spac reported offer mcconlogue borderless service crypto focused investment vehicle interview coindesk mcconlogue outlined detail proposal including cryptocurrency feature embed grander ambition medium empire powered blockchain technology asset primary target stop acquisition strategy mcconlogue interview medium ripe change banking ripe change cryptocurrencies reshape mcconlogue bid crypto explodes global prominence distributed technology offer way model trust build economic unit finance deal cryptocurrencies follow flow sector promise underdelivers practice mcconlogue offer fully capitalized meaning borderless position immediately buy owner integrated whale medium investment purchased company family owns remaining financed debt equity arranged private equity firm are management corp mcconlogue background traditional finance including stint engineer storied fund citadel experience leveraged gain access deep equity table term legacy member binance drop defamation lawsuit document are responded coindesk request comment press time integrated whale reached comment unclear discussion guarantee accept offer mcconlogue valuation magazine claim reader reached people web valued jwplayer jw video hl aw setup playlist http cdn jwplayer medium hl aw crypto medium empire addition making bid mcconlogue plan acquire number network print medium deal financed are mcconlogue endgame bring awareness cryptocurrencies reader viewer interested traditional finance demographic untouched people opening magazine mcconlogue change scope coverage focus news future finance noted crypto blockchain news coindesk alum writer widened scope include dedicated reporting crypto robo trading quantitative trading thing world changing quickly market changing news mcconlogue popular list product borderless owned boast crypto wallet integration metamask feature prominently browsing experience reader receive token disbursement finishing article commenting sharing social medium channel similar medium site decrypt experimental app publication borderless remit issue token mcconlogue token supported journalism defunct consensys backed startup civil recently brick collective protocol borderless service skunkworks project developed technology people consume information mcconlogue detail scant mcconlogue asked record time building wireless protocol called overline operate offline blockchains sounded polkadot meet mesh network mcconlogue background computer science made headline teaching homeless code crunchbase cite developer collider interoperable blockchain project funded initial coin offering unclear collider borderless related mcconlogue hired team developer contractor work technological breakthrough including call attention mining opinion crypto frontier journalism borderless medium empire eventually involve host radio transmitter antenna atop skyscraper global crypto transaction touching internet mcconlogue sound ambitious fanciful mcconlogue begin baby step btc mined raspberry pi plan make acquisition node owner buy jwplayer jw video yzrtal setup playlist http cdn jwplayer medium yzrtal,0.1459293394777266,positive,0.44477726574500775,"{'neg': 0.034, 'neu': 0.842, 'pos': 0.124, 'compound': 0.9899}",0.9899,0.034,0.842,0.124,positive,0.0,0.03422982876716423,neutral
binance,Markets,Chinese Crypto Traders Are Pouncing on SHIB Coin Known as ‘Doge Killer’,"Watch out,  dogecoin : A new digital token trending (and price pumping) in Chinese cryptocurrency circles is billing itself as the “DOGE killer.”  The new SHIB token has unabashedly coopted the name of the Shiba Inu dog breed whose image has come to represent the joke cryptocurrency dogecoin. Perhaps as menacing, SHIB has just garnered fresh listings on the three most popular cryptocurrency exchanges among Chinese users, Binance, Huobi and OKEx.  And this puppy is all of a sudden garnering astonishing investment from Chinese traders, even though they seem well aware that the project appears to have no earnest technological promise. On Monday, when Binance  launched  trading in the SHIB token, the price nearly doubled on Huobi, where it was already trading.  That’s despite Chinese traders being as likely to call it “s**tcoin” in their local language, as SHIB coin.     The new obsession shows the extent to which the recent  dogecoin phenomenon  – where money seems as playful as a slobbery toy – has spread to denizens around the world. Traders seem happy enough to go along as dogecoin’s price pumps and dumps repeatedly, often timed to a fresh tweet from billionaire Elon Musk. Over the past weekend, Musk mentioned dogecoin multiple times when he hosted  “Saturday Night Live.” The DOGE price has tumbled 29% in the past two days.  “SHIB's price performance over the weekend clearly shows that the crypto industry hasn't had its fill of canine-themed meme coins just yet,” Rick Delaney, senior analyst at OKEx Insights, said. 'Billions or even trillions' OKEx listed the SHIB coin  on May 8 , just a few days ahead of Binance. Huobi has the most trading volume of SHIB, according to CoinGecko. A Huobi spokesperson didn’t respond to CoinDesk's request for comment by press time. The Shiba Inu coin, as the SHIB token is formally known, has a price so low, at $0.00002766, that the project’s backers say it “allows users to hold billions or even trillions of them.”  The price “can remain well under a penny and still outpace dogecoin in a small amount of time,” according to the token's  website . “SHIB is an experiment in decentralized spontaneous community building,” the website continues. “BONE is our next token!” There’s a even link to a “ woofpaper ,” dated April 29.   The website goes on to recite some surprisingly sophisticated crypto-industry insider references: “We locked the 50% of the total supply to Uniswap and threw away the keys,” the website added. “The remaining 50% was burned to Vitalik Buterin and we were the first project following this path, so everyone has to buy on the open market, ensuring a fair and complete distribution where devs don't own team tokens they can dump on the community.” A market cap of... ? It should be noted that the website offers no identifying information about any individuals associated with the project. And as cryptocurrency professionals know, the digital-asset industry is replete with scams. So investors should exercise caution.    On  CoinGecko,  a cryptocurrency pricing website, the total market capitalization of SHIB is given as a question mark, with a maximum token supply of 1 quadrillion.  No professional cryptocurrency analysts in China expressed confidence to CoinDesk about any fundamental reasons for SHIB’s bounding price.  Such admonishments appear to have done little to dissuade traders.   
 Binance temporarily suspended all withdrawals on its exchange after the listing, according to  a tweet on its official Twitter account . The   speculation https://www.wu-talk.com/kuaixun/5281.html  was that the suspension was caused by the sudden traffic from SHIB trading. 
 The price pump “is made possible because this token is so cheap that even a single retail investor can buy a few tokens with no trouble,” Colin Wu, a popular Chinese crypto industry blogger, told CoinDesk. In China, “there is a mood that people believe its price would go up.” A billionaire influencer The sudden popularity of SHIB appears to be partly the handiwork of social-media influencers on popular Chinese platforms, including Weibo and WeChat. Charles Xue Biqun or Xue Manzi, a billionaire venture capitalist and one of the most active investors in the Chinese internet industry, has mentioned SHIB in multiple posts on Weibo to his more than 11 million followers. He has also been actively talking about dogecoin, according to his Weibo feed. “Doge No. 2 hits new all-time highs, almighty,” he wrote in a Weibo post dated May 8, with screenshots of SHIB/USDT and DOGE/USTD pairs on crypto exchange Huobi. “Doge has already gone up a lot,” Alex Zuo, vice president of China-based crypto wallet Cobo, said. “It gives an example of the ‘wealth-making effect.’ Plus that Shiba inu coin may also benefit from the localization.... With all the promotions by influencers on Weibo.” “We find it very inexplicable,” Zuo said. “I didn’t buy any SHIB and no one around me has bought any.” Screen grab of Xue Manzi's Weibo post.

binance, Sponsored , Cross-chain protocol brings together liquidity sources from multiple networks ,"A cross-chain aggregation protocol allows crypto enthusiasts to access liquidity sources from multiple networks on one platform — making it easier than ever to find the best prices. O3 Swap  says its goal is to help users discover the most efficient routes for their trades, and complete transactions without limitations and hidden fees. Just some of the liquidity sources it supports include Uniswap, SushiSwap and Curve on the Ethereum blockchain; PancakeSwap, DODO and BakerySwap on Binance Smart Chain; as well as Flamingo, Nash and Switcheo on Neo. All of this ensures that multi-chain assets can be freely exchanged, and different blockchains can be accessed with ease. The blockchain industry can prove exceedingly fragmented — and is often littered with a number of networks that can’t communicate with each other directly. To counter this, O3 Aggregators are deployed on mainstream networks to track down the most competitive trading rates, while the O3 Hub is at the heart of this ecosystem — executing transactions through the use of a cross-chain pool. Developers behind O3 Swap liken their offering to a multi-chain version of 1inch or a cross-chain version of Curve. Given the high fees and inefficiencies that can exist in some areas of the decentralized finance sector, this project hopes to simplify transfers for all… and eliminate some of the limitations that exist in market-leading products today. The project recently secured investment from SoftBank Singapore, saying: “We are looking forward to strengthening and developing the partnership further toward achieving common goals.” ‘Made with love in Tokyo’ O3 Swap is the brainchild of O3 Labs — an open-source project that says it is dedicated to turning ambitious visions of a smart economy into reality. The platform’s testnet is now live, meaning that crypto enthusiasts can put the infrastructure through its paces. Maximum transaction amounts on offer are currently set at below $20. In the middle of April, O3 Swap announced that it had successfully completed a $2 million funding round with a number of contributors — including NGC Ventures, OKEx Blockdream Ventures and the Neo Eco Fund. This new platform is complemented by O3 Wallet, which delivers an on-ramp and enables Bitcoin, Ether, NEO and other top digital assets to be purchased using local fiat currencies, with credit card payments accepted. Desktop apps are available for Apple and Windows devices, and mobile apps have also been developed for iOS and Android. As work continues on O3 Swap, a research and development club has been established on Discord that allows users to deliver their feedback and suggestions on the trial version of this new product. Rewards are going to be offered in exchange for quality contributions. More insights from O3 Swap  here Big milestones ahead Now O3 Swap’s official website and litepaper has launched, alongside a Neo swap module, attention is turning to the roadmap for the rest of 2021 and beyond. ETH and BSC swaps will soon be supported, and the O3 Swap testnet will give way to Version 1, which will enable crypto enthusiasts to enjoy all of these promised features in full. By the end of the year, a decentralized autonomous organization is going to be established, and O3 Swap’s aggregation protocol will have been deployed on layer-two networks. This will pave the way for Version 2 to make its debut in 2022, with support for instant quotes and pending orders. Further enhancements are also going to be made to its cross-chain functionality. O3 Swap says it has been designed in response to an urgent problem — network congestion and poor scalability on the Ethereum blockchain. Although alternative networks for retail investors have emerged, barriers between blockchains are holding DeFi back from achieving its full potential. This project hopes to provide the winning solution that stops network isolation in its tracks. Learn more about  O3 Swap Disclaimer.

binance,Markets,Dogecoin Jumps 22% as Elon Musk Hints at Improving Network's Transaction Efficiency,"Dogecoin  (DOGE) is once again running with the wolves after Tesla's Elon Musk tweeted ""potentially promising"" news for the network. According to a  Twitter comment  by Musk on Thursday evening, Tesla and its CEO are ""working with Doge"" developers to ""improve system transaction efficiency.""  Prices across major exchanges including Binance, Bitfinex, FTX, Gemini and Poloniex are posting around 22% gains over a 24-hour period for the Shibu Inu-inspired meme coin.

The increase came even as other major cryptocurrencies' prices sank.  jwplayer(""jw-video-am9NBZ3H"").setup({playlist:""https://cdn.jwplayer.com/v2/media/am9NBZ3H""}) Meanwhile, U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase announced it would be  adding DOGE  to its suite of crypto offerings in six to eight weeks, likely due to  client demand  as has been the case with other  major exchanges . Doge price The world's second-richest man has played a large role in DOGE's astronomical 9,400% rise in value since it was just a pup trading at around $0.005 on Jan. 1. Musk's handiwork has previously affected DOGE's price. Last month, Tesla's CEO hinted the Shibu Inu-inspired crypto would feature on ""Saturday Night Live,"" with Musk calling himself the "" Dogefather ."" Prices immediately spiked on the tip, jumping 24% from $0.25 to $0.31. DOGE's price  continued to soar  leading up to Musk's appearance on the show, touching an all-time high of around $0.74, but  immediately cooled  after traders'  hopes were dashed  by Musk's meager mention of the crypto that night. See also:  Coinbase to Add Dogecoin in the Next 6-8 Weeks The problem,  some argue , is that DOGE is unlikely to survive without Musk's help, though developers appear to be  making headway  in a project that once had zero involvement from crypto technicians.

binance, News , PancakeBunny tanks 96% following $200M flash loan exploit ,"Popular Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized finance protocol PancakeBunny has suffered a major exploit that allowed a hacker to make off with more than $200 million worth of crypto assets. 
 According to a series of threads posted by the PancakeBunny team in the past hour, the protocol was subject to a flash loan attack from an external actor. The attacker borrowed “a huge amount” of Binance Coin (BNB) before manipulating the asset’s price and dumping it on the platform’s BUNNY/BNB market. 
 
 4⃣ The hacker then dumped all the bunny in the market, causing the bunny price to plummet 5⃣The hacker paid back the bnb through pancakeswap https://t.co/ph9OoLQQAD https://t.co/IWYfBHuijb — pancakebunny.finance (@PancakeBunnyFin)  May 20, 2021 
 
 
 The attack saw the price of BUNNY quickly pumped from $150 to $240 before plummeting to $0 in just 30 minutes. After consolidating below $10 for roughly two hours, BUNNY last changed hands for $8.8. 
 BUNNY/BNB:  Poocoin.app BUNNY/BNB was the only pool to be drained by the hacker, with the malicious actor making off with 697,000 BUNNY and 114,000 BNB. With Binance Coin trading for roughly $296 at the time of writing, the hacker is believed to have made off with  $200 million  in assets. 
 The attacker also attached a private note containing a rabbit-themed pun to the transactions that drained the pool that reads: “ArentFlashloansEaritating.” All funds borrowed to execute the attack were returned via PancakeSwap. 
 As the hack wreaked havoc across one of Binance Smart Chain’s leading projects — with Bunny representing a total value locked of more than $1 billion prior to the hack — onlookers are  discussing  whether Binance will move to roll back the incident. 
 In May 2019, Binance lost more than $40 million in a major attack, with CEO Changpeng Zhao suggesting the losses could be reversed by convening with miners to  roll back transactions from the Bitcoin blockchain . 
 PancakeBunny is the latest DeFi protocol to suffer a flash loan attack, with the exploit increasingly manifesting as a  scourge on the decentralized finance sector . 
 In April, crypto data aggregator Messari reported that flash loans had become the most popular attack vector in the DeFi ecosystem, accounting for roughly  half of the $285 million worth of DeFi exploits  identified since 2019.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/pancakebunny-tanks-96-following-200m-flash-loan-exploit,cointelegraph,2021-05-20,00:00:00,en,371,2340,5.218328840970351,138,0.3719676549865229,popular binance chain based decentralized finance protocol pancakebunny suffered exploit allowed make crypto asset series thread posted pancakebunny team past hour protocol subject flash attack external actor attacker borrowed huge amount binance coin bnb manipulating asset dumping platform bnb market dumped market causing plummet paid bnb pancakeswap http ph oolqqad http iwyfbhuijb pancakebunny finance pancakebunnyfin attack quickly pumped plummeting minute consolidating roughly hour changed hand bnb poocoin app bnb drained malicious actor making bnb binance coin trading roughly time writing believed made asset attacker attached private note rabbit themed pun transaction drained read arentflashloansearitating fund borrowed execute attack returned pancakeswap wreaked havoc binance chain leading project representing total locked onlooker discussing binance move incident binance lost attack ceo changpeng suggesting loss reversed convening miner transaction bitcoin blockchain pancakebunny latest defi protocol suffer flash attack exploit increasingly manifesting scourge decentralized finance sector crypto data aggregator messari reported flash loan popular attack vector defi ecosystem accounting roughly half defi exploit identified,0.12692307692307694,positive,0.528846153846154,"{'neg': 0.279, 'neu': 0.631, 'pos': 0.09, 'compound': -0.9885}",-0.9885,0.279,0.631,0.09,negative,-0.5714285306122479,0.09333333271111112,negative
binance, Follow up ," Growing pains? DeFi exploits plunder BSC, which calls for reinforcements  ","Several decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols running on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) have fallen victim to major exploits in recent months as the sector continues to see substantial growth in 2021. Binance’s very own smart contract blockchain platform has seen a surge in demand since its launch in September 2021, due to its low fees and high throughput. This has allowed the Binance Smart Chain to appropriate a percentage of the DeFi market as platforms looked for an alternative to Ethereum’s high gas fees. While Ethereum still commands the lion’s share of the DeFi network’s transaction volume due to the number of major platforms running on its blockchain, BSC is an attractive alternative that has enjoyed real success, spurred on by its interoperability with the larger Binance ecosystem. Given that Binance is the largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume in the world, its ecosystem drives a significant amount of cryptocurrency transactions and trading. Nascent DeFi platforms running on BSC have attracted large user bases, but an unfortunate consequence has been the prevalence of nefarious individuals exploiting smart contract flaws.  The result has seen millions of dollars fleeced through these exploits. BurgerSwap saw a combined $7.2 million worth of various cryptocurrency tokens  drained from its liquidity pools in May . Attackers also managed to net  around $6 million in profit  through a flash loan attack on Belt Finance in May as well. PancakeBunny saw  $200 million worth of various tokens stolen  through another flash loan exploit in the same month. Cream Finance, bEarn, Bogged Finance, Uranium Finance, Meerkat Finance, SafeMoon and Spartan Protocol have also suffered exploits on BSC in recent months, highlighting the scale of attacks across the ecosystem. The recent spate of exploits of some significant BSC-based DeFi platforms has prompted Binance to directly  address  questions regarding the security of BSC in recent times. Moreover, Binance moved to  secure help from blockchain intelligence firm CipherTrace  with hopes to rectify the situation. Cointelegraph also reached out to Binance for additional comment regarding the hacks but did not receive a reply at the time of publishing. External and internal threats The reality of the situation is that  judging  by the rising amount of total value locked in the platforms, it seems that people enjoy using Binance Smart Chain. Since it’s a public blockchain, however, the decentralized, permissionless nature leaves the door open for exploits. BSC differs slightly from other public blockchains like Ethereum in that it employs a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm and relies on 21 main elected validators to maintain the network. This also allows BSC to prevent individual validators from gaining significant control and potentially making changes to transactions or the blockchain. Related:  DeFi hacks on Binance Smart Chain rise as TVL and volumes increase In this sense, the blockchain itself is secure, and there is no risk of a 51% attack or exploits of that nature, where most of the network gets taken over and exploited. However, platforms and smart contracts deployed on BSC can fall prey to what Binance describes as external threats.  An external threat could include any type of exploit of technical or operational vulnerabilities of platforms and projects built or deployed on BSC. Meanwhile, internal threats would include rug pulls, exit scams and insider theft or hacks. As Binance highlighted in its recent blog post addressing exploits of BSC-based DeFi platforms, auditing every DeFi project and decentralized application that is launched on BSC is a serious undertaking and realistically cannot be carried for every single project running on the chain: “Not every project on BSC is open-source, and even then, being open-source doesn’t automatically mean secure. Then there’s the security of smart contracts and no zero-defect codes, and as each project is developed by an independent team, there’s always a chance of defects.” Binance also noted that it does not enforce any “reviewal process or centralized governance” to prevent malicious projects from launching on BSC. This is described as “not technically or logistically possible,” while the exchange notes that it would also constitute a form of censorship that would essentially threaten the decentralization of its ecosystem. Nevertheless, BSC does work with a couple of third-party firms that carry out verification and audits of various projects and tokens running on its blockchain. This does have its limitations as well, as Binance highlighted: “These audits are not mandatory and they rarely cover new or emerging DApps. When looking for a genuine project, it’s recommended to avoid uncertified projects and always prefer projects with multiple audits from different companies.” CipherTrace to the rescue In an effort to address the uptick of exploits of DeFi platforms running on BSC, Binance has also tapped into the services of CipherTrace. The support will aim to identify higher-risk financial transactions on BSC and more than 600 decentralized applications running on the platform. Cointelegraph reached out to CipherTrace to unpack the extent of its analytics services to BSC and what this will entail. CipherTrace CEO Dave Jevans stated that the company’s monitoring services would offer BSC similar insights to those provided to other clients, projects and platforms: “Our compliance monitoring tools provide functionality to identify proceeds of crypto crimes and rug pulls for financial institutions, cryptocurrency companies and law enforcement. Monitoring for all chains, including BSC, provides similar outcomes — identifying illicit sources of funds to prevent bad actors from offramping their ill-gotten gains.” CipherTrace has been extensively involved in cryptocurrency and blockchain analytics, having traced cryptocurrency that has been stolen from exchanges, as well as transactions from dark web marketplaces. Jevans expressed some insights as to why BSC has been the biggest target of DeFi exploits in 2021. He believes that due to the high fees on Ethereum, “BSC makes for an attractive alternative.” However, he added: “The more DApps that are built on BSC, the more exploits we will see take place.” Jevans also added that the prevalence of exploits targeting BSC-based DeFi platforms is a direct result of the novelty of BSC and the number of unaudited smart contracts deployed by the projects: “Bad actors flock to new projects that haven’t performed adequate smart contract audits. Especially in the current climate, hackers are examining every single DeFi protocol to see what exploits they can find.” Interestingly, Jevans also noted a difference in carrying out blockchain analytics on Binance Smart Chain in comparison to other blockchains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin: “Ethereum and BSC are account-based blockchains, making it more difficult to track the flow of Ether or BSC-based tokens. In contrast, Bitcoin and Zcash are UTXO-based, enabling the tracking of actual Bitcoins or Zcash like is possible with dollars that have serial numbers.” Step by step? While the Binance Smart Chain continues on its growth path — all while fending off  claims of severe network centralization  — as things stand, it may not have the necessary resources or tools to completely safeguard DeFi platforms from suffering exploits while running on BSC. However, the platform is at least taking meaningful steps in helping address the issue.  CipherTrace could become an important cog in the Binance ecosystem thanks to its tracing and analytics tools, and this may well give users some peace of mind when using BSC-based DeFi platforms. Should more exploits occur, at the very least, the analytics firm will supposedly be on-hand to trace stolen funds and identify illicit transfers to and from platforms running on BSC.  From here on out, BSC can move on to finding a possible cure for the route of the illness instead of addressing the aftermath.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/growing-pains-defi-exploits-plunder-bsc-which-calls-for-reinforcements,cointelegraph,2021-06-05,00:00:00,en,1248,8047,5.434294871794871,475,0.38060897435897434,decentralized

binance, Sponsored , NFTs and DeFi are coming together on a launchpad tokenizing creative work ,"A new project is bringing NFTs and DeFi together to build a launchpad that will help creative artists and inventors tokenize their intellectual property and raise funds on a single platform. Built on the Binance Smart Chain, LEXIT’s platform does more than just turn works of art, music, books, video, collectibles, games, source code and inventions — any copyrighted or patented intellectual property — into nonfungible tokens. It also brings in decentralized finance (DeFi) to make those NFTs available to anyone via DeFi liquidity pools,  LEXIT  CEO Amir Kaltak and CBO Katia Zaitsev explained on a Cointelegraph AMA on May 25.  There’s a reason LEXIT is a launchpad and not a marketplace. It’s not making NFTs of the actual art, video or code. It is tokenizing the IP, and splitting it up into multiple tokens that lets creators raise the funds needed to support their creation. “You need money to protect your invention, and to approach companies to excite them about it and to license it and to create a product out of it, because that costs even more money,” Kaltak said.  What LEXIT does is provide access, he added. Access to capital for creators, and access to investment opportunities for supporters. However, the platform is not a free-for-all, Kaltak noted. First, creators who approach the site will be vetted to ensure they have the rights to the property they want to tokenize, and undergo Know Your Customer checks. “Then you come to the evaluation side of things where we try to deem if that's something interesting to our community at this time or not.” This gives LEXIT the ability to support artists and creators from less fortunate parts of the world, Zaitsev said. “There's so much hidden talent all over the world that normally goes unnoticed, bumped down the queue, or don't even have the support to make it to that queue in the first place,” she said. “With LEXIT, what we want to bring is equality to the industry and not have privilege decide whether you're entitled to your own success. We want to focus on that creative side. On our platform everyone has a fair shot."" The DeFi pools LEXIT’s DeFi pools will not be open only to its own tokens. “Any external project can create a LEXIT DeFi pool and then provide liquidity to make their coin or token available on LEXIT,” the company’s  whitepaper  notes. “They can choose among a wide range of trading pairs for their swaps or also create mixed portfolios to leverage the market for their project.” More insights from LEXIT  here LEXIT pool managers can choose from a variety of LEXIT NFTs, staking at least 5% of the pool’s liquidity. The pools can be set up as single pair swaps or offer a mixed portfolio of NFTs, coins, and tokens. Staking programs are coming, Zaitsev added.  Pool managers will be vetted, identified and give a LEXIT rating by pool participants.  A new blockchain rising LEXIT recently held a two-part initial DEX offering (IDO) of its LEXi at PancakeSwap and BitMart for 650,000 LEXi Coins. Built on the Binance Smart Chain, the LEXi Coin will be the only currency with which to purchase NFTs on LEXIT.  The company chose BSC over Ethereum for a couple of reasons, Kaltak said. While the sky-high gas fees currently found on Ethereum were part of it, a bigger factor was that LEXIT felt the BSC Pad was the right partner to choose for its own launch. That said, the company is building its own blockchain, LEXNET, which Kaltak said is a high-performing, fully cross-chain oriented protocol. LEXIT will be a DApp on top of it.

binance,Business,"Binance-Backed Travala Launches Dtravel, a ‘Decentralized Airbnb’","Binance-backed booking site Travala.com is launching  Dtravel , a decentralized vacation rental service that gives homeowners a stake in the platform.  Unlike the setup on a centralized platform such as Airbnb, Dtravel homeowners and house guests share a joint ownership of the platform. Dtravel is community owned through the Dtravel DAO (decentralized autonomous organization), in which peer-to-peer communication and voting are core to the effort. The TRVL token will be the main conduit. “It really comes down to trust, and this is what we see with blockchain. You can guarantee trust on a level you would never be able to on a centralized platform,” Travala CEO Juan Otero said. The DAO model allows hosts and guests to vote on issues that include everything from last-minute cancellations to how community treasuries are spent. Over the past year, COVID-19 has challenged booking companies, which have taken away funds from hosts. With a return to travel, a decentralized platform like Dtravel has the potential to have a global reach, Otero said. It’s not the first crypto project to attempt this business modeal. Former Uber employees started the  Airbnb-esque Bee Token project , but they struggled to find users before they shut down the platform. Otero said recent developments in blockchain technology and usage could give Dtravel a better fate. The company plans to incentivize use of cryptocurrency across the platform by enabling the first 100,000 hosts to list their homes on Dtravel to collectively earn more than $35 million in TRVL coins.  Travala.com has more than  3 million listings  of homes and hotels and more than 200,000 monthly users, Otero said. The platform offers more than 30 methods of payment, though 70% of users pay with cryptocurrencies. Dtravel is based on the Binance Smart Chain. Over the past past five months, it has raised $5 million in funds from Kenetic Capital, Future Perfect Ventures, DHVC, Plutus.

binance, News , Binance burns $390M worth of BNB tokens ,"Major cryptocurrency exchange Binance has completed its 16th quarterly Binance Coin ( BNB ) burn, destroying over $390 million worth of BNB. On Sunday, Binance reported that it had destroyed 1,296,728 BNB tokens valued at just under $400 million at the time. The exchange noted an additional 5,163 BNB that were destroyed through its Pioneer Burn Program — an  incentive  that aims to help users who have lost tokens through honestly mistaken transactions to smart contracts. Binance covers the losses, returning the tokens to users under specific circumstances. These token numbers are then deducted from the quarterly burn totals by the exchange. In summary: 1,296,728  #BNB  (390,855,150 USD) burned by  @Binance . The remaining 16m BNB unlocked, and moved to a team address, according to the schedule in the white paper. #Binance  team has never used or sold a single team  #BNB  thus far, only burned them. — CZ  Binance (@cz_binance)  July 18, 2021 
 
 Binance has pledged to burn 20% of the exchange’s profits every quarter, with the latest burn suggesting the exchange could have profited by $2 billion during the second quarter of 2021. The latest burn is the second-largest in Binance Coin’s history by fiat value, with a  whopping $600 million worth of BNB having been destroyed in March . Despite the scale of the burn, the event appears to have had little impact on the Binance Coin markets, with BNB prices trending sideways over the weekend.

binance, Market Analysis , Data suggests UNI is 36% overvalued and SUSHI is trading at a discount ,"Just looking at Binance Coin’s ( BNB ) reported market capitalization, one might conclude that the token is the dominant asset when compared to other exchange tokens. Although there is no direct relationship between Binance’s exchange volume (or revenue) and token economics, traders seem to use it as a proxy. The controversial burn mechanism has been losing impact since April 2019, when the  exchange changed the BNB white paper .  Initially, the white paper proposed a plan where BNB tokens equivalent to 20% of the exchange’s profit would be bought under a “repurchasing plan,” but the new version scrapped that plan. Exchange tokens market cap and volume. Source: Messari Screener and CoinGecko However, excluding the 60 million BNB that has never been in circulation drastically changes the outcome because these excess tokens are meant to be burned over time. The remaining exchange tokens are inflationary, meaning the issuing rate is very steep. For example, Uniswap (UNI) has 611 million tokens in circulation, but that number is expected to reach 1.14 billion in 10 years. BNB price (above) and Binance exchange daily volume (below). Source: TradingView and Nomics How BNB differs from other exchange tokens BNB has an actual use case apart from trading fee rebates, and it is the primary asset pair on the Binance Smart Chain. BNB captures a portion of the $17-billion total value locked in the BSC smart contracts, and it has decent market share and representation on decentralized exchanges. As a result, the network creates perpetual demand for BNB.  Based on these simple figures, should analysts discount BNB’s value by 50% compared to other exchange tokens? As mentioned earlier, the market appears to be pricing BNB based on Binance exchange’s volume, and thus it makes sense to use that as a valuation proxy. Uniswap has been averaging $1.63 billion daily volume, although it offers exclusively spot markets. Therefore, the figure is comparable with Binance’s $24.3-billion average, not factoring in derivatives markets.  Using Uniswap’s 93.3% lower volume, the gross estimate accrues a $10.3-billion market capitalization based on 50% of BNB’s reported $76.7 billion. Thus, the prediction comes out 36% below UNI’s actual data. PancakeSwap, the leading decentralized exchange on Binance Smart Chain, has been handling $750 million in daily volume. Using the same 50% of BNB’s market capitalization methodology, the estimated valuation of PancakeSwap’s CAKE token should be $4.73 billion, which is surprisingly in line with the current figure. FTX and SUSHI are trading at a discount Moving to a centralized exchange, FTX has amassed $1.7 billion in daily volume, including derivatives markets. Consequently, the indicator can be compared to Binance’s $54-billion average. Despite its 96.8% lower volume, FTX’s gross estimate valuation is $4.83 billion — 11% below the actual number. Using Huobi’s adjusted $5.4-billion volume and Binance’s entire $54-billion daily average volume, including its derivatives products, results in a $15.34-billion estimated valuation. When considering Huobi Token’s unprecedented inflationary model, applying a heavy discount for the reported market capitalization makes sense. Lastly, SushiSwap aggregates a daily $305-million transaction volume. Considering Binance’s $24.3-billion spot-only data, the same estimate yields a $1.92-billion valuation roughly 33% above the actual figure. It is worth noting that this estimate does not imply an investment recommendation. This unrefined and primitive methodology simply aims to show that traders are effectively using exchange volume as a proxy for native token valuation.  While this may have worked in the past, the current regulatory, Know Your Customer and removal of leverage trading options on centralized exchanges could impact the efficacy of this analysis method in the future.

binance, Altcoin Watch , FTX Token hits new record up 50% so far in September — What’s driving FTT price higher?  ,"FTX crypto exchange’s native utility token, FTT, reached a new record high on Monday a week after it agreed to  acquire LedgerX , a United States-based crypto derivative platform, for an undisclosed sum. On Monday, the FTT/USD exchange rate surged 16.37% to $73.99 in a market-wide rally that saw other top coins post similar but dwarfed price rallies. Additionally, the pair’s intraday climb coincided with gains among top exchange tokens, with Binance Coin ( BNB ) rising 2.3% and  Uniswap’s UNI  recording 3.5% profits on a 24-hour adjusted timeframe.  24-hour performance of the top 10 crypto exchange tokens. Source: Messari LedgerX acquisition The news of FTX’s Ledger acquisition served as the primary bullish backdrop behind FTT’s rally. On Aug. 31, the crypto exchange revealed that it wants to offer a wide array of crypto-based asset classes in the U.S. via its regional wing, FTX.US. As a result, its acquisition of LedgerX, a U.S.-regulated crypto derivatives exchange and clearinghouse for retail and institutional investors, would mean  broader market exposure for FTX services . FTT jumped 34.42% in response to the LedgerX news on Wednesday. Later, the cryptocurrency entered a consolidation phase, only to resume its uptrend on Monday, rising up to 16.37%. In total, its month-to-date gains came out to be a little over 50%. FTT/USD four-hour price chart.

Token holders can also use  FTT as collateral for futures positions . Meanwhile, institutions that want to buy a white-label version of FTX’s OTC portal and futures exchange can do so by using FTT. Therefore,  FTX’s network growth  tends to directly correlate with FTT’s price performance.

binance,Markets,South Korea’s Registration Deadline for Crypto Exchanges Could Erase $2.6B in Assets: FT,"Around $2.6 billion worth of digital assets could be wiped out when South Korea’s deadline for crypto exchange registration rolls around on Sept. 24, the  Financial Times  reported Sunday. South Korea’s  Financial Transaction Reports Act  is requiring all crypto exchanges to register with the Financial Services Commission (FSC) by the end of the month. To comply with the country’s anti-money laundering and know-your-customer procedures, crypto exchanges need to register with local banks and set up real-name accounts for their customers. Read more:  Binance Discontinues South Korean Won Trading Pairs, Payment Options The FSC has advised exchanges that are unable to meet regulatory obligations must inform their customers of any potential closure by Sept. 17. Around two-thirds or 40 exchanges out of 60 have yet to register, according to the report, with experts saying it could create a “bank run” scenario. A bank run occurs when the majority of customers attempt to withdraw their money fearing the institution will cease to exist. In some extreme cases, financial institutions’ reserves have failed to cover the cost of customer withdrawals, and experts are warning the same for smaller crypto exchanges in the country could occur. “A situation similar to a bank run is expected near the deadline as investors can’t cash out of their holdings of alt-coins listed only on small exchanges,” said Lee Chul-yi, head of medium-sized exchange Foblgate. “They will find themselves suddenly poor. I wonder if regulators can handle the side effects.” The Financial Times cites industry data and points out that roughly 90% of South Korean crypto trading is conducted in altcoins, some of which are known as “Kimchi coins.” Kimchi coins are tokens primarily developed by Koreans. Read more:  South Korea’s Financial Watchdog Warns Foreign Exchanges Must Register in 2 Months Around 42 Kimchi coins are expected to disappear, according to estimates by Kim Hyoung-joong, head of the Cryptocurrency Research Center at Korea University. Another expert cited in the report, Cho Yeon-haeng, president of Korea Finance Consumer Federation, said that “huge investor losses are expected” as trading is suspended and assets are frozen. Many of the smaller exchanges are unlikely to offer customer protection as they stare down immediate closure, he said. On Tuesday, Bitfront, a crypto exchange subsidiary of  Japanese tech giant LINE , is expected to cease providing a Korean-language service and halt payments with South Korean credit cards as it seeks to appease regulators and cut ties with the country. Last month, Binance halted  trading pairs  and payment options using the South Korean won, intending to proactively comply with local regulations.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/13/south-koreas-registration-deadline-for-crypto-exchanges-could-erase-26b-in-assets-ft/,coindesk,2021-09-13,18:39:00,en,426,2746,5.427230046948357,143,0.33568075117370894,digital asset wiped korea deadline crypto exchange registration roll financial time reported korea financial transaction report act requiring crypto exchange financial service commission fsc end comply country anti laundering customer procedure crypto exchange local set account customer binance discontinues korean trading pair payment option fsc advised exchange unable meet regulatory obligation inform customer potential closure third exchange report expert create bank run scenario bank run occurs majority customer attempt withdraw fearing institution cease exist extreme case financial institution reserve failed cost customer withdrawal expert warning smaller crypto exchange country occur situation similar bank run expected deadline investor holding alt coin listed exchange chul medium sized exchange foblgate find suddenly poor regulator handle side effect financial time cite industry data point roughly korean crypto trading conducted altcoins kimchi coin kimchi coin token primarily developed korean korea financial watchdog warns foreign exchange month kimchi coin expected disappear estimate hyoung joong cryptocurrency research center korea university expert cited report yeon haeng president korea finance consumer federation huge investor loss expected trading suspended asset frozen smaller exchange offer customer protection stare closure bitfront crypto exchange subsidiary japanese tech giant line expected cease providing korean language service halt payment korean credit card seek appease regulator cut tie country binance halted trading pair payment option korean intending proactively comply local regulation,-0.060344827586206906,negative,0.31810344827586207,"{'neg': 0.107, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.064, 'compound': -0.886}",-0.886,0.107,0.829,0.064,negative,-0.684210490304711,0.09793814382506112,negative
binance,Features,Play-to-Earn Is Already the Biggest Star in the Metaverse,"If you want to play the role of God, you can’t overlook the fish. This is the implied message of a woman named Kelsei, aka “Pandapops,” who, over a video live-stream, gives a class on how to create digital worlds. Imagine an empty grid. Then the grid is filled with an aquarium, water and spooky fish. One of the fish has creepy eyes. One has a weird little tail. One looks like an alien. Pandapops is upbeat and friendly, with a British accent and bright blue hair. “I really wanted the aquarium to look like there’s depth to it,” she explains. For the next two hours she meticulously creates and tweaks her digital assets: She adds splash effects to the aquarium, she grows a flower and paints it an eerie shade of blue, she completes her “witch’s cottage.” (The asset’s meta-description: “Witch’s cottage: humble home for any aspiring woodland witch.”) Jeff Wilser is the author of seven books including “Alexander Hamilton’s Guide to Life,” “The Book of Joe: The Life, Wit, and (Sometimes Accidental) Wisdom of Joe Biden” and an Amazon Best Book of the Month in both non-fiction and humor. The work is strangely fascinating, like a 2021 version of watching Bob Ross paint. Soon the virtual world begins to expand. Pandapops finishes her aquarium, drops it into a tavern, then plunks the tavern itself into a village she has created, nestling it between a patch of trees. The village is alive with people, and now it becomes clear that she’s designing a game. “This guy doesn’t give us quests yet, but he will,” Pandapops said of the barkeep, who, like all of the tiny avatars, look a bit like characters from the Lego movies. “That’s a bounty hunter,” she said. And soon we see our protagonist, the proverbial “player one,” who jogs through a courtyard with a cute little sword. Pandapops is not a professional game designer. She’s not an employee of Epic, Sony or Electronic Arts. She’s using a program called VoxelEdits to create a game for The Sandbox, the newest blockchain-enabled metaverse, which launches its “public alpha” in late September. And she’s not alone. Even before the launch of the metaverse, there have been over 100,000 downloads of Sandbox’s Game Maker engine (currently in beta), according to Sebastien Borget, the company’s co-founder and COO. “Our Game Maker requires no code, and you can make games without any experience,” Borget said. “That’s what we’ve been building for over three years.” Read more:  A Crypto Guide to the Metaverse They’ve actually been building for 10 years. Sandbox, which originally launched in 2011 as a normal and non-blockchain start-up, represents the shift from traditional gaming to crypto-gaming. Sandbox started as a mobile app. Borget said that while the app was downloaded 40 million times, “the success of the game came from the users.” These users created 70 million assets. None of them earned a nickel, which is typically the case with traditional games like Minecraft and Roblox. After Borget learned of CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks and the user-owned wizardry of NFTs, he flipped the model of Sandbox to a decentralized blockchain metaverse, which would “turn players into creators” and then “help players and creators monetize all the content they make.” Let’s back up. For the non-blockchain obsessed, the metaverse is still something of an obscure and opaque concept. That could soon change. The New York Times is running  metaverse explainers ; traditional brands like Sotheby’s and Coca Cola are dipping into the metaverse; and perhaps most consequentially, Mark Zuckerberg has  hitched Facebook’s future  to this virtual star, telling employees over the summer that the company’s overarching goal is to “help bring the metaverse to life.” Which begs the question, what is the metaverse, exactly? Is it just one platform, or the sum total of all? Ask 10 different people at a crypto conference, and you’ll get 10 different definitions. “We should not expect a single, all-illuminating definition of the ‘Metaverse,’”  writes  venture capitalist Matthew Ball. “The Metaverse is best understood as ‘a quasi-successor state to the mobile internet’. This is because the Metaverse will not fundamentally replace the internet, but instead build upon and iteratively transform it.” This is why the stakes are so high. Maybe today and tomorrow, the metaverse is just an online virtual world – like Decentraland, Crypto Voxel and The Sandbox – where you play a quick game, browse NFTs in an art gallery or have an online meet-up. This is the metaverse’s infancy. But in five or 10 or 20 years, perhaps the metaverse replaces much of what you do online, or even offline. Instead of a Zoom with your parents who live across the country, you join them for a metaverse game of tennis. Or instead of consuming the news on Twitter, maybe you’re dropped into a metaverse simulation of what’s happening in Afghanistan. What path will we take to arrive at this metaverse future? Through the centralized, big tech route of Facebook? Or through a new decentralized model? As NFT artist “6529.eth” framed the question in a viral  Twitter thread , “What we are playing for is whether our children will be fully free or residents in a digital company universe – with the illusion of free, but not really free.” Covid, art, zombies I first visited  Decentraland  a year ago. While I was intrigued by the world’s potential, it felt a touch under-populated. “I’ll be honest with you, we released a product before it was really ready,” said Sam Hamilton, who’s the community and events lead at Decentraland Foundation. “So we rolled our sleeves up.” The team pumped out more content, more events – art exhibits, conferences, music festivals, “  quests https://decentraland.org/blog/announcement/decentraland-quests-the-journey-begins/ ” – and the crowds rolled in. Monthly users jumped from 7,000 to 70,000. A few things help explain that growth: the boom in NFTs, the surge of play-to-earn crypto games and maybe even the pandemic. “COVID is a terrible, terrible thing, and we’ve all suffered greatly,” said Voxel Bunny, lead artist at Sandbox. (They use a pseudonym for anonymity.) “At the same time, going online is the norm. The metaverse feels even more approachable and appealing.” The metaverse can be a home for art. And we now live in a world where celebrities like Steph Curry, Grimes, Paris Hilton, Jack Dorsey and Shawn Mendes are buying or minting NFTs. Suddenly the metaverse has newfound relevance, or even urgency. How do you showcase your art? How do you flaunt your  Ape NFT ? Decentraland’s Art District is one of the world’s standout features, creating a more immersive way to admire NFTs than to just stare at your phone. Artists are pouncing on the opportunity. The NFT collection “World of Women” – featuring 10,000 women, with an emphasis on diversity and inclusion – plans to buy a chunk of land in Sandbox, and then build a museum to hang paintings and animations. “Is ‘metaverse maximalist’ a term yet?” asks Gordon Goner, one of the anonymous co-founders of The Bored Ape Yacht Club. Goner is a Metaverse Maximalist. (He just coined the term.) “I’m feeling fairly confident that we’re less than 20 years out from the “ Ready Player One ” experience,” said Goner. The Bored Apes are planting roots in both Decentraland and Sandbox; Goner said the club’s plan for Sandbox is still a “state secret,” but that you’ll be able to walk around in the metaverse as your three-dimensional “ape.” In Decentraland, you and your degenerates can hang in the Bored Ape Yacht Club riverboat casino. And the metaverse, in turn, is investing in art. On Sept. 7, the Sandbox purchased one of the rarest Bored Apes, “The Captain,” for 740 ETH, or roughly $2.4 million. “We strongly believe that culture, whether games, music, visual arts, will be one of the pillars of the open crypto metaverse,” The Sandbox  explained  at the time. “We don’t just build and sell. We invest and help build the ecosystem.” The building of that ecosystem is no longer just the work of spunky crypto startups, but also includes splashy brands. Sandbox’s partners include Atari, The Smurfs and “The Walking Dead.” Why zombies? “The Walking Dead” partnership gives at least two ways for Sandbox to create sticky content: First, the metaverse held “land sales” for people to buy coveted digital real-estate next to “Walking Dead” locations on the map, like the prison that featured prominently on the show. (Only in the upside-down world of crypto would land next to a zombie-prison be more valuable.) Second, the “Walking Dead” IP can be used as NFTs for games you create on Sandbox, boosting the crossover appeal. Read more:  The Metaverse Is Coming, Companies Need to Prepare You’ll spot this same kind of mainstreaming in Decentraland. Hamilton said that in the “early days” of the metaverse (last year), the only brands they partnered with were crypto players like Binance, Skale and Kraken. Then came Atari. Then came Sotheby’s, which opened a virtual art gallery in the metaverse. As the head of sales at Sotheby’s, Michael Bouhanna, told  theartnewspaper , “We see spaces like Decentraland as the next frontier for digital art.” Then came Coca-Cola. Decentraland created a “can-top party” where you could swim inside a bottle of Coke and experience being inside the bubbles. It’s easy to see the mutual benefits: The metaverse gets compelling content, the traditional brands get engaged eyeballs. “We loved how Decentraland embraced the brand and created unique experiences,” a Coke executive  later said . “We loved seeing NFT and metaverse artists take the iconicity of the brand and put a fresh, modern twist on it.” And then came the games. To (Axie) Infinity and beyond Crypto play-to-earn games, such as Axie Infinity and Alien Worlds, have exploded. (You’ll find a fine primer  here .) I tried playing Axie as a stunt for this article. You start by purchasing three Axies, cute little cartoon blobby creatures, that you then breed and send to battle. At the time of my attempt, the cheapest of these blobs cost $200, which put the entry fee at around $600 ... and thus ended the shortest experiment in my writing career. Other gamers are bolder (or they got in before the prices skyrocketed), as Axie  claims  to have 250,000 daily active players and 90,000 ETH (or over $300 million) traded in its in-house marketplace. “Everyone is looking at the success of Axie [Infinity] and saying, ‘Wow, this is definitely the future,’” said Decentraland’s Hamilton. He adds that it’s only part of the metaverse future, as “gaming isn’t everything,” but for many, it seems to be the real draw. Hamilton said that while events (such as the “ To the Moon ” music festival) provide spikes of traffic, play-to-earn crypto games have been “the most popular stuff on Decentraland on a consistent basis.” And this takes us back to The Sandbox, to the live-streaming of Pandapops, and to the make-your-own-game ecosystem. The Sandbox is betting on games. Their “Game Maker” console allows you to create games (even complicated quest games) from scratch, such as the one Pandapops is working on, with the aquarium and the tavern: Your character will start the game with no memories, you will unlock the memories along your journey, and you’ll need to find a way to escape a maze. Eventually, you will free a once-evil ogre from the ogre king. Honestly? The concept feels a bit flimsy, and Pandapops would later tell me with a laugh, “I’m not very good at the game-maker side of things.” (Her passion is live-streaming for blockchain gaming, which she does for both herself and Sandbox.) Yet some of the games are far more complex, thanks to an early decision by Sandbox. The company bankrolled a “Creator Fund,” recruiting digital artists to build the assets that would breathe life into this new metaverse. “We wanted to make sure that when we open a virtual world, it’s not going to be like an empty mall,” said Borget. So they incentivized artists in two ways: 1) Compensation for creating the artwork, and then 2) If the artist is able to sell their art to someone on the Sandbox marketplace, they pocket 100% of the proceeds, with Sandbox taking an extra 5% commission. “It’s unbelievable. In all the years I’ve been making art, since 2007, I’ve never seen anything like it,” said Voxel Bunny, who once sold a Witch Tower for 3,150 SAND, or roughly $2,300 in today’s prices. Then there’s the Game Maker fund. 450 artists and 54 studios, according to Borget, have been funded to create Sandbox games. One of these 54 studios is Sand Rush, co-founded by Christopher Weller, who goes by the alias of Necrobombicon. “I came into this industry as an artist,” said Weller. “I learned that Sandbox was willing to pay its artists with cryptocurrency.” First he thought he’d bang out some assets himself, then he met other like-minded artists on the Sandbox Discord. They created a game studio, Sand Rush, that creates elaborate games like Jungle Rush, described as “a place of old magic, mystery and lore,” where “ancient technologies lurk in the shadows.” He has already found Sandbox to be lucrative. Sand Rush collaborated on the creation of “The Shrine of Truth,” a mystical structure meant as a centerpiece for someone’s digital land, and sold it for 100,000 SAND, or roughly $100k at current prices. Beeple’s  $69 million this is not, but now imagine a pipeline of artists who can sell their NFTs in the marketplace, which in turn can be used to build games. That’s already happening. Borget said that the Sandbox creator’s economy has topped $48 million in volume (pre-launch), with over 350,000 wallets created. What’s in this Sandbox marketplace? As of the time of this writing, you could buy a “pool party cool guy” for $42, a beach van for $787, a tree house $840 and a “crazy pool” for $525 (it’s not at all clear how the pool is crazy). This is at the low-end. For those on a more luxurious budget, you might want to consider an “ancient magic statue” for $3,150 (it is neither ancient nor magic), a “robot incubator” for $10,429 or a “summer rock metal band” for $5,214. On the one hand, sure, to state the obvious, you can hire an actual rock metal band, which plays actual music, for less than $5,214. Then again, this marketplace enables creators to be compensated for their work. “It’s an exciting moment in history, where suddenly a new sphere in work appears,” said Voxel Bunny. “Suddenly there are new jobs that were not here a few years back.” This feels refreshingly concrete. While much of the capital sloshing around the crypto ecosystem is difficult to understand or process, here’s an example of the rising tide of crypto prices directly helping artists. This could have a domino effect. First Voxel Bunny creates the Witch Tower and sells it for $2,300, then perhaps a buyer – a game creator – uses it in a quest that she herself will monetize. Now the players of this game will earn crypto as they try and solve the quest, completing the virtuous cycle. Sure, speculation and profit-seeking is part of the model, but is that really any different than the profit-seeking of billion-dollar gaming corporations? Enter Darth Vader Decentraland or The Sandbox? Or maybe Crypto Voxels? Or another of the many metaverse projects popping up, such as  Realm  or  Neon District ? Which one “wins”? The various metaverse projects, at least for now, seem to view each other as more cooperative than competitive. “I don’t think it’s a winner-take-all situation,” said Decentraland’s Hamilton, who thinks that just as there’s room for a Twitter and Facebook and Snapchat and Tik-Tok – each playing a different role – there will be space for multiple platforms in the metaverse. Sandbox’s Borget said that “each one has a different strength,” with Decentraland more aligned with events, Crypto Voxels as “more simple and accessible,” and Sandbox with gaming. But finally, of course, we have the issue that looms over all of this. It’s what I’ll call The Darth Vader Scenario. In a weird coincidence, on the very same day I spoke to many of these crypto-metaverse advocates, I happened to visit a buddy who wanted to show off his new “Oculus,” a virtual reality headset. It’s made by Facebook. It’s the gateway to Horizons, Zuckerberg’s plan for the metaverse. I slipped on the VR goggles, completed a quick tutorial, and then gasped as I found myself on the top of a skyscraper. A virtual city enveloped me. Blue sky, honking cars, planes overhead – it all looked real. Maybe not quite photorealistic, but real enough so that when I peeked over the edge of the skyscraper, my stomach lurched at the sight of the ground far below. I don’t have a fear of heights. And my brain knew that in reality, yes, of course, I was safely in my friend’s living room. That didn’t matter. When I “walked the plank” to step out from the edge of the skyscraper, looking down at the 100-story drop beneath me, I was both terrified and thrilled. Read more:  Inside Alien Worlds, the Biggest Game in the Metaverse “Jump off the plank!” My friend urged me. “No way.” “Do it!” Below me was certain death. I hesitated. What tipped me over the edge, literally and figuratively, was the sound of my friend’s young son in the background, laughing at my cowardice. Finally, I jumped off the edge of the plank … and of course, landed safely on the carpet of the living room. It was exhilarating. I then rode a virtual roller coaster, played a virtual shooter game, and then – to the delight of my inner 12-year-old – played a virtual reality (VR) game of Star Wars, complete with Darth Vader himself. I wanted to buy an Oculus. The game and the VR tech is not particularly new, but it’s one thing to know that in the abstract, and it’s another to see it and feel it in your bones. While a blockchain metaverse might win every argument on the principles – empowering players, decentralizing the tech, actual ownership of digital assets– in practice, for the average user, how does that stack up to the easy lure of flying through the air or clashing lightsabers with Darth Vader? The tech behemoths have seemingly every advantage: bottomless resources, easy access to brands (Avengers metaverse?) and, in the case of Facebook, a built-in user base of 2.8 billion. Blockchain is still the underdog. I thought back again to Pandapop’s humble aquarium, with the creepy fish and the splash effects that she painstakingly added. I thought of her simple game where you need to escape a maze and slay the ogre king. It’s true that Pandapops could own that aquarium, monetize her game and claim a legitimate sense of empowerment. (It’s also true, of course, that the blockchain games will likely get more sophisticated in time, especially as creators are incentivized to make more.) But will the average gamer care? Just look at the internet. For decades, most of us have chosen – whether we knew it or not – the sugary speed and convenience of big tech centralization. Even if it cost our privacy or agency, we enjoyed our stored passwords, auto log-ins and using Google, Apple, Facebook et al. to make our digital lives smoother. We preferred a centralized Darth Vader to the decentralized maze. Time will tell if we choose differently in the metaverse.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/09/14/play-to-earn-is-already-the-biggest-star-in-the-metaverse/,coindesk,2021-09-14,17:57:00,en,3260,19258,4.9003067484662575,1333,0.4088957055214724,play

binance, Market Analysis , Uniswap (UNI) gains nearly 50% in 24 hours as China’s latest crypto purge boosts DEX tokens  ,"Uniswap (UNI) prices staged a solid rebound after crashing last week in the wake of  China’s decision  to intensify its anti-Bitcoin ( BTC ) and cryptocurrency rhetoric. UNI price gained 14.90% on Monday to reach an intraday high of $26.26. UNI/USD’s climb came a day after it dropped to a monthly low of $17.63. As a result, it churned out more than 48% profits for the dip buyers within the last 24 hours. Adoption FOMO UNI serves as a governance token inside Uniswap’s decentralized exchange (DEX) ecosystem. As a result, its holders get to vote on matters that help steer the future direction of the DEX platform.  Additionally, UNI holders could also  receive a potential revenue share  in the future. For the uninitiated, Uniswap’s governance contract contains a so-called “fee switch”; if activated, it will enable UNI holders to earn a part of the protocol’s fees.  Some users already generate revenues by contributing to Uniswap’s pools of assets, earning between 0.05% and 1% of the value of each trade in the current version. Uniswap's liquidity pool schematic. Source: Uniswap Official Doc Page  Therefore, the prospect of Uniswap growth as a DEX could also mean a higher adoption curve for UNI. And so it appears, China’s  intensifying crackdown  on the crypto industry has boosted the tokens appeal among speculators. The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) and other government agencies  deemed crypto transactions illegal  in an announcement made public on Friday. Meanwhile, they also targeted offshore cryptocurrency exchanges, warning that it is illicit to provide online trading services to Chinese residents. The move served to fix a loophole that remained in place after the PBoC banned all regional financial institutions from offering services to crypto companies. During this time, China-based traders had continued to use off-shore cryptocurrency trading platforms, such as Huobi, Binance and OKEx.

 But decentralized trading platforms like Uniswap are attempting to  steer clear of governmental jurisdictions  by replacing the custodial asset model with a non-custodial one based on smart contracts and multi-signature technology.  As a result, the recent bout of buying in Uniswap markets has appeared in sync with similar rallies across its top rivaling DEX tokens, as shown in the Messari index below. Uniswap and SushiSwap (SUSHI) has led DEX gains in the previous 24 hours. Source: Messari Overall, the DEX index containing 60 assets was up 10.27% around 12:05 UTC, calculated on a 24-hour adjusted timeframe. Meanwhile, the gains of 13 centralized exchange tokens, including Binance Coin ( BNB ) and FTX Token (FTT), came out to be only 0.77% in the same period, suggesting traders’ sudden FOMO for their DEX rivals.

binance,Policy,Stablecoin Issuers Could Soon Face Bank-Like Regulations,"Stablecoin issuers including Tether and Circle could soon be subject to bank-like regulations, according to a report from the  Wall Street Journal . The reported recommendation is part of a Treasury-led presidential advisory group’s upcoming stablecoin report. First  announced  in July, the report is now expected to be released in late October. A Treasury spokesperson declined to comment. A senior administration official confirmed to CoinDesk that the report is accurate and that the federal government is looking at two different pathways. The first is the congressional pathway outlined by the WSJ, though the official did not provide specifics. The second is through the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), a panel of regulators tasked with monitoring potential risks to the financial system. The news comes as Capitol Hill grows increasingly concerned about the lack of regulation in the  $130 billion  stablecoin market. In a floor speech on Wednesday, pro-crypto Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) called for regular audits of stablecoin issuers and expressed concern with the lack of transparency of major issuers’ reserve backings. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has  suggested  that stablecoins might be classified as securities under U.S. law, thus subjecting them to more regulatory scrutiny. A number of stablecoin issuers are in the process of, or have stated intentions to, obtain bank-like regulatory status. Circle said in August it wants to be a  national crypto bank ; Paxos, which issues USDP (formerly PAX) and BUSD in partnership with Binance, got a conditional banking charter in  April . “Today’s news reports about the potential recommendations from the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets (PWG) is encouraging, as the time has come to address the risks and seize the significant opportunities of dollar digital currencies like USD Coin (USDC),” Circle Chief Strategy Officer Dante Disparte told CoinDesk through a spokesperson,” adding: “Circle has already been working toward becoming a full-reserve national commercial bank, and we strongly believe that a full-reserve banking model built on digital currency technology can lead to a more efficient, fair, inclusive and resilient financial system.” In a research note Friday, investment firm Wedbush Securities said the news casts a favorable light on the Facebook-initiated Diem project. ”We believe Silvergate/Diem should receive the green light from regulators shortly after the regulatory goalposts are established given Silvergate’s longstanding warm relationship with regulators and very conservative nature in which it plans to manage stablecoin reserve balances,” Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini wrote.

The exchange showcased the eight-figure fund in a tiered development model across four specialist areas: Talent Development, Liquidity Incentive Program, Builder Program and Investment & Incubation Program. The announcement suggested that they will allocate $100M, $100M, $300M and $500M to each segment, respectively. The largest benefactor of the pot, the investment & incubation program, will focus on multi-chain expansion of the already burgeoning areas of the technological sphere.

binance, Market Analysis , Binance Coin eyes $560 next after BNB price 'Cup and Handle' breakout ,"The ongoing price boom in the Binance Coin ( BNB ) market is painting a classic bullish chart pattern with an upside target of $560. Dubbed as Cup and Handle, the pattern appears when the price forms an advance that appears like a U-shaped trend (Cup). That follows up with a formation of a descending channel range (Handle). A breakout above the Handle range typically leads to an upside continuation, with a bullish target at a length equal to the Cup's size. So it appears that BNB has undergone a price trajectory that looks like the  Cup and Handle pattern . Furthermore, the cryptocurrency's latest rally, accompanied by an increase in trading volumes, took its prices above the Handle range—a breakout—that raised the possibilities of bullish continuation ahead. BNB/USD 4H price chart featuring Cup and Handle setup. Source: TradingView.com As a result, should the BNB price rally sustain, it will eye a run-up towards the Cup and Handle breakout target near $560. Conversely, if the price falls below the Cup resistance (~$437), it would risk invalidating the entire bullish setup. BNB price fundamentals The latest BNB price rally appeared after Binance, via its blockchain project Binance Smart Chain (BSC),  launched a $1 billion fund  to accelerate adoption across the entire crypto industry. This earmarks $300 million for projects building decentralized applications atop BSC. Traders typically view incubation events backed by blockchain projects as bullish for their native assets. Such events prompt developers to build new projects on dedicated public/private ledgers, which boosts the demand for their in-house tokens. For example, in early October, Solana, a public base-layer blockchain protocol, announced over $5 million worth of rewards and seed funding for developers participating in its global hackathon called Ignition. The news helped to push the price of  SOL, Solana's native token, up by 35% , as Cointelegraph covered. BNB appeared to have gone through a similar bout of speculation. Santiment, a crypto data tracking service, also  detected  a rise in BNB accumulation across wallets that already hold millions of dollars worth of tokens. So-called Binance Coin whales bought about 412,000 BNB in the past two weeks, thus adding 8.7% more tokens to their existing holdings. Binance Coin whale holders data. Source: Santiment The BNB accumulation among rich investors surged despite  warning signs from regulators  in  some  countries.  Related:  Globe-trotting Binance looks to Ireland for ‘centralized’ headquarters Binance also remains under investigation by several agencies in the United States, which has  prompted  several hedge funds, including Tyr Capital and ARK36, to either stop or scale down trading on their crypto exchanges.

binance, Market Analysis ," Ethereum price hits $3,800, boosting bulls' control in Friday's ETH options expiry ","Ether ( ETH ) entered a slightly bullish channel earlier this month and currently, the price is marching toward the $3,800 level. Despite the recent turbulence, Ether bulls are set to bag a $53 million profit on Oct. 15's weekly options expiry.  Investors also appear to be disinterested in  Ether's recent underperformance  versus Bitcoin ( BTC ) and to date, the altcoin's gains stand at 265%. If Ether manages to stay above $3,600 on Friday, 99% of the $180 million put (sell) options will become worthless. Ether price at Bitstamp in USD. Source: TradingView Ethereum smart contract competitors continue to pressure the leading network and at the time of writing, Ethereum's average gas fees remain above $20. Polkadot (DOT) is scheduled to  begin its sidechain auctions on Nov. 11 , and this will support new token launches, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, all going through trustless cross-network bridges. This week, Binance Smart Chain revealed plans to launch a  $1 billion fund to accelerate adoption  across the entire crypto industry. Investors usually interpret potential incubation events backed by blockchain projects as bullish for their native assets and BNB price gained at least 30% since the announcement.  Bears were not expecting prices above $3,300 Based on the recent mildly negative newsflow, it is possible to understand why bears placed 88% of their bets at $3,300 or lower. Had bulls been a little less greedy, they could have dominated Oct. 8's $365 million expiry. The Oct. 15 expiry is perfectly balanced between call (buy) and put (sell) options according to the long-to-short ratio. Still, this birdseye view needs further detail, depending on the expiry price. Ether Oct. 15 futures aggregate open interest. Source: Bybt At first sight, both sides hold some $180 million worth of Ether options, as indicated by the 1.03 call-to-put ratio. However, this metric is deceptive because the recent Ether rally will likely wipe out most of their bearish bets. For example, if Ether's price remains above $3,500 at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, only $6.6 million of the put (sell) options will be available. Bulls are comfortable at $3,600 Any expiry price above $3,500 is a bear trap, although a $32 million advantage should not be enough to cause damage. To put things in perspective, Ether's monthly options expiry holds over $800 million open interest. Below are the four likeliest scenarios considering the current price levels, as the imbalance favoring either side represents the potential theoretical profit from the expiry. The data shows how many contracts will be available on Oct. 15 for both bulls (call) and bear (put) instruments. Between $3,300 and $3,500:  7,450 calls vs. 3,550 puts. The net result favors bulls by $13 million; Between $3,500 and $3,600:  11,150 calls vs. 1,900 puts. The net result favors bulls by $32 million; Between $3,600 and $3,800:  15,400 calls vs. 600 puts. Bulls' profit increases to $74 million. Above $3,800:  27,450 calls vs. 0 puts. Bulls dominate by profiting $104 million. This crude estimate considers call (buy) options used in bullish strategies and put (sell) options exclusively in neutral-to-bearish trades. However, a trader could have sold a put option, effectively gaining a positive exposure to Ether above a specific price. Unfortunately, there's no easy way to estimate this effect. Bears need sub-$3,500 to balance the scales Bulls' profit increases to $104 million with Ethereum trading above $3,800, thus a $30 million increase from the current $74 million estimated gain. On the other hand, there's a $61 million gain from the bear's perspective by pressuring the price below $3,500, as the above estimate shows.  With little over a day before the Oct. 15 expiry, the bears will have a hard time suppressing the current bull run. Regardless of the competition the Ethereum network faces and the high gas fees, investors' demand for decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible tokens (NFTs) seem to be enough to keep Ether in an uptrend.

binance, News , Binance Smart Chain surpasses 1.5 billion lifetime transactions ,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume,  tweeted  on Oct. 26 that the cumulative number of transactions on its Binance Smart Chain ( BNB ) has  surpassed  1.5 billion. The network achieved this milestone a mere 14 months after its launch on Aug. 31, 2020.  According to BscScan, the daily number of transactions on the blockchain recently  surged  to over 10 million — just shy of its all-time record high of 13 million back on July 29. There also appear to be more than 108 million unique wallet addresses on BSC’s blockchain,  compared  to about 650,000 at the beginning of the year. In recent months, the BSC network has become a viable Ethereum competitor in terms of both cost and efficiency. Based on data from YCharts.com, average gas prices and block times on the Ethereum network  amount  to $131.87 and 13.33 seconds, respectively. Meanwhile, it takes only 3.02 seconds to mine a new block on the BSC, with users paying, on average, $6.64 in gas fees to execute smart contracts on the blockchain. However, BSC is far more centralized than the Ethereum network, with only 21 approved  validators .  Changpeng Zhao — the now billionaire founder of Binance — has stated that he has ambitious plans to expand BSC. Earlier this month, he announced a  $1 billion accelerator fund to advance BSC  and the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Currently, the most popular decentralized application, or dApp, on BSC is PancakeSwap — a decentralized exchange, or DEX. According to CoinGecko, PancakeSwap  has  more than 2,436 altcoins available for trading.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-smart-chain-surpasses-1-5-billion-lifetime-transactions,cointelegraph,2021-10-27,00:00:00,en,257,1569,5.042801556420233,98,0.38132295719844356,binance world largest cryptocurrency exchange volume tweeted cumulative number transaction binance chain bnb surpassed network achieved milestone mere month launch bscscan number transaction blockchain recently surged shy time record unique wallet address bsc blockchain compared beginning recent month bsc network viable ethereum competitor term cost efficiency based data ycharts average gas price time ethereum network amount second take second mine bsc user paying average gas fee execute contract blockchain bsc centralized ethereum network approved validators changpeng billionaire founder binance stated ambitious plan expand bsc earlier announced accelerator fund advance bsc cryptocurrency ecosystem popular decentralized application dapp bsc pancakeswap decentralized exchange dex coingecko pancakeswap altcoins trading,-0.0062500000000000056,negative,0.45416666666666666,"{'neg': 0.017, 'neu': 0.843, 'pos': 0.14, 'compound': 0.9022}",0.9022,0.017,0.843,0.14,positive,0.6666665555555741,0.06249999934895834,positive
binance,Markets,"SHIB Flippened DOGE With $160M in ‘Smart Money’ Backing Latest Pump, Blockchain Data Shows","Shiba inu, the self-proclaimed dogecoin killer, briefly surpassed DOGE in market value on Wednesday, according to  data from CoinGecko . Both coins now have a market cap of over $31 billion and are toggling between 10th and 11th on CoinGecko’s  rankings page , as of press time. Blockchain data shows that while SHIB continues to attract  retail investors  around the globe, more-sophisticated crypto traders are fueling the latest rally. Since the beginning of this week, addresses labeled as “smart money” by blockchain data firm Nansen started buying up SHIB, according to Daniel Khoo, a research analyst at Nansen. The buying was mostly concentrated in the past seven days, worth about $160 million. Addresses labeled as “ smart money ” include traders who made more than $100,000 in profit by providing liquidity and mining liquidity in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols and public entities that invest in crypto. “It was shocking to me,” Khoo said, adding that he didn’t expect SHIB to become accumulated by “smart money.” Read more:  Shiba Inu Coin (SHIB): A Beginner’s Guide 2021 Data from another blockchain data firm, Santiment, also supports the perspective. SHIB transactions worth at least $1 million started increasing since the beginning of October, Santiment data shows. The whale activities spiked on multiple days in the past weeks, as SHIB’s price rallied. SHIB prices versus SHIB whale transactions. Source: Santiment Notably, while there have been a lot of SHIB spot activities on centralized exchanges, at press time roughly 66% of SHIB are on decentralized exchanges versus 13% on centralized exchanges, according to Nansen. Over on centralized exchanges, SHIB’s trading volumes mostly come from Binance, Coinbase and BKEX, according to CoinGecko. Compared with Binance and Coinbase, BKEX is a little-known exchange started in China. SHIB hits China Google trends also revealed another interesting fact about shiba inu: Despite China  doubling down on its crypto trading ban , traders in the East Asian country have shown an unquenchable appetite for SHIB that’s nearly as high as their counterparts in the United States. Google trends for search query ""SHIB"" (Source: Google Trends) At press time, Google Trends, a widely used tool to gauge retail interest in trending topics, shows a value of 98 for the search query “SHIB” in China versus 100 in the U.S. over the past week. A score of 100 represents peak popularity – the maximum number of searches observed for a term during a given time frame. It means more and more people are scanning the web for information on SHIB. The finding is extraordinary considering the fact that the market has been  talking down  China’s influence on crypto for weeks. Chinese crypto traders may be lying low, but they have not quit crypto, as suggested by SHIB’s latest rally.

binance,Policy,Biden Administration to Congress: Put Stablecoins Under Federal Supervision – Or We Will,"A group of U.S. regulators urged lawmakers to subject stablecoin issuers to the same strict federal oversight as banks, in a highly anticipated report released Monday. Congress should also require custodial wallet providers to be regulated by a federal agency and limit stablecoin issuers’ interactions with non-financial companies such as tech or telecom providers, the President’s Working Group for Financial Markets said. The latter recommendation appeared to be aimed squarely at  Diem , formerly Libra, the controversial stablecoin project created by  Meta , the social media giant previously known as Facebook. The report  is part of an escalating effort by policymakers to rein in this  $138 billion segment  of the broader crypto market to mitigate the risks they believe stablecoins pose to consumers, markets and the financial system. Stablecoins, or cryptocurrencies pegged to the value of another asset such as the U.S. dollar, have seen  explosive growth  over the last two years despite lingering questions about their backing. “Without the safeguards, I think the industry and regulators alike think we might miss out on some potential benefits of financial innovation,” Treasury Under Secretary for Domestic Finance Nellie Liang told CoinDesk. “So I think there’s a common appreciation of needing a framework that isn’t too onerous, provides protections and can keep the innovation moving forward.” If Congress fails to pass such laws, the regulatory agencies have the authority to take their own measures. However, the group gave the impression it would prefer that it doesn’t happen. “We believe legislation is important,” Liang said. “This is a new technology, a new innovation. It shouldn’t be surprising that the current regulatory framework isn’t set up to address some of the new kinds of risks that this could pose.” Congress may be willing to get involved. Members of both the Democratic and Republican parties have been engaged in discussions around regulating cryptocurrencies at large and stablecoins in particular, Liang said. The working group is nominally composed of Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler and Acting Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chair Rostin Behnam. Each of these individuals could designate a representative to participate in the group. Other bank regulators, including the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, were also represented in the group. A footnote to the report notes that stablecoins are used for trading, lending and borrowing, but the report added that these tokens may eventually become a means of payment for businesses and households. Another footnote specified that the report is not addressing any potential stablecoin issues under federal securities or commodities laws, but the report itself did acknowledge the SEC and CFTC’s authority to oversee stablecoins that meet the provisions of these laws. The legislation would apply to stablecoin issuers that are headquartered in the U.S., operate stablecoins that people in the U.S. can access or otherwise have a strong tie to the U.S. Congressional entreaties The group’s chief recommendation is that Congress draft and pass legislation that would ensure a federal regulator can oversee the stablecoin industry. “To address the  prudential risks  of payment stablecoins, the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets … recommend[s] that Congress act promptly to enact legislation to ensure that payment stablecoins and payment stablecoin arrangements are subject to a federal prudential framework on a consistent and comprehensive basis,” the report said. Treating stablecoin issuers like other federally regulated insured depository institutions would address risk concerns, the report said, going so far as to say that these types of institutions should be the only entities able to issue stablecoins. “In particular, with respect to stablecoin issuers, legislation should provide for supervision on a consolidated basis; prudential standards; and, potentially, access to appropriate components of the federal safety net,” the report said. “The legislation would prohibit other entities from issuing payment stablecoins. Legislation should also ensure that supervisors have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins.” The report notes that a single entity might not be responsible for all parts of a stablecoin’s operations. It broke the stablecoin process down to three components: the token’s issuance, how it’s exchanged and how it’s stored. Legislation should address all three components and allow each part to continue to be conducted by a different entity, the report said. To that end, the report also recommends that Congress specifically address custodial wallet providers, placing them under a federal regulator as well. At the moment this recommendation is limited to wallet providers that specifically offer stablecoin services, a senior administration official told CoinDesk. Custody of non-stablecoin digital assets and custodial wallets that don’t offer stablecoin services are not covered by this recommendation. At the moment, Anchorage, Paxos and Protego are the only crypto companies overseen by a federal regulator. All three companies have conditional trust charters through the OCC. Exchanges and other stablecoin issuers are otherwise overseen at the state level in the U.S., with companies like Gemini issuing stablecoins under the supervision of the New York Department of Financial Services. Tether (USDT) and USD coin (USDC), the top two stablecoins by market capitalization, are not issued by federally regulated companies, although Coinbase and Circle (the companies behind USDC) are regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services. USDT, issued by a company  incorporated in Hong Kong  that has settled  two   different   investigations  by U.S. agencies, makes up half of the overall stablecoin market, with $71 billion of tokens in circulation at press time. USDC brings another $33 billion to the sector, according to  CoinGecko . In contrast, the Binance and Paxos dollars, both of which are issued by Paxos, account for about $14 billion, or around 1/10th of the overall stablecoin market. Other stablecoin issuers remain largely outside the supervision of any U.S.-based regulators. “Because payment stablecoins are an emerging and rapidly developing type of financial asset, legislation should provide regulators flexibility to respond to future developments and adequately address risks across a variety of organizational structures,” the report said. Despite the central role stablecoins play in decentralized finance (DeFi) borrowing and lending, the report does not address these projects specifically. While DeFi is mentioned in the document, it is “not the subject of the recommendations in this report.” Still, the report details how stablecoins fit into DeFi, including through  automated market makers . Carrot and stick The stablecoin report goes to great pains to emphasize that Congress should enact legislation giving a federal regulator the authority to oversee stablecoins. Should Congress not act, the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC) could designate some stablecoin activities as being “systemically important payment, clearing and settlement activities” (PCS activities), which would give federal agencies the authority to draft their own regulations around stablecoins. The council, created in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis, is made up of financial regulators from different agencies and chaired by the Treasury secretary. “Financial institutions that engage in designated PCS activities also would be subject to an examination and enforcement framework. Any designation would follow a transparent process,” the report said. Even before this happens, agencies like the SEC and CFTC as well as the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) could take advantage of a number of consumer finance or financial regulation laws to enforce risk protection rules against issuers. The report also notes that stablecoin transactions could fall under the aegis of “money transmission services,” subjecting these entities to anti-money-laundering and Bank Secrecy Act regulations. While the report seems to threaten that FSOC or other federal agencies can take independent action, the authors indicate that this is a contingency plan if Congress does not act on its own to enact legislation in line with its recommendations. “The rapid growth of stablecoins increases the urgency of this work. Failure to act risks growth of payment stablecoins without adequate protection for users, the financial system, and the broader economy. In contrast, a regulatory framework that supports confidence in payment stablecoins, in normal times and in periods of stress, could increase the likelihood of stablecoins supporting beneficial payments options,” the report said. Risks The group’s recommendations are borne out of three main risks identified by the report, ranging from the personal to the systemic. The report identified what it described as “key gaps” in how regulators could oversee stablecoins, particularly with regard to banking regulations. “These prudential recommendations apply to ‘payment stablecoins,’ defined as those stablecoins that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a fiat currency and, therefore, have the potential to be used as a widespread means of payment,” the report said. “These stablecoins are often, although not always, characterized by a promise or expectation that the stablecoin can be redeemed on a one-to-one basis for fiat currency.” According to the document, stablecoins pose risks to users through the possibility that they may break their peg, which could lead to a run on the stablecoin, which could further harm any investors who expect the token to maintain price parity with the fiat currency to which it’s pegged. The document cited concerns such as the possibility that stablecoins are backed by commercial paper and other risky securities rather than cash. “If stablecoin issuers do not honor a request to redeem a stablecoin, or if users lose confidence in a stablecoin issuer’s ability to honor such a request, runs on the arrangement could occur that may result in harm to users and the broader financial system,” the report said. There are also payment system risks, including credit, liquidity, operational, governance and settlement risks. These issues could appear as financial shocks or reliability concerns for individuals using stablecoins as a means of payment. Stablecoins could one day pose a systemic risk to the U.S. financial system as well, the report said. “The failure or distress of that entity could adversely affect financial stability and the real economy,” the document said. A stablecoin issuer and wallet provider working with a commercial entity could amass outsized economic power, a scenario the report likened to  mixing of banking and commerce  interests, which U.S. law has largely forbidden since the 1930s. This type of union could let a party use information like credit ratings or other data to restrict how a customer could access goods and services. “This combination could have detrimental effects on competition and lead to market concentration in sectors of the real economy,” the report said. A long time coming The working group announced in July it was examining stablecoins and their potential risks to the financial sector with an eye to mitigating any potential financial stability risks. It’s not a new concern. The group met under former President Donald Trump  at the end of 2020 , announcing concerns about the scale of stablecoin payments and the potential risks they posed. In preparing the report, members of the group spoke to representatives from stablecoin issuers including Tether, Paxos, Gemini, Coinbase, Circle and the Diem Association, the document said. Digital asset custody providers like Anchorage and payment providers like Visa, Mastercard, Square and Stripe also provided input, as did trade associations, third-party experts, academics and banking organizations. Some industry participants have had only a limited voice in this process, complained Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), who drafted an  open letter  to Treasury Secretary Yellen last month asking for greater consultation with the sector. The administration official told CoinDesk that the group held a handful of roundtable discussions with industry participants and the other experts tapped. Stablecoins have been on the regulatory radar for over two years now, but attention to this segment of the crypto industry has ramped up in recent months as regulators around the world began publishing their conclusions. Last month, the Financial Stability Board, an international body,  published a report  finding that some nearly 50 different nations have “gaps” in their regulatory framework for stablecoins, which could allow entities to engage in “regulatory arbitrage,” referring to businesses that jump from a jurisdiction with a stringent regulatory framework to one with fewer rules. Similarly, the Bank for International Settlements, a central bank for central banks,  argued  that countries should require stablecoin issuers to comply with existing international payment, clearing and settlement rules. Reading the fine print Monday’s report is specific to stablecoins and how they might fare if they are treated like banks. However, the footnotes hint that more may be to come from the Biden administration. One such note said the administration will continue evaluating cryptocurrencies and distributed ledger technology at large, emphasizing how today’s document is restricted to stablecoins. And while the report did mention DeFi and non-bank regulators, it hinted that there may be more specific proposals or suggestions around these aspects of the crypto market and regulation as well. “While the scope of this report is limited to stablecoins, work on digital assets and other innovations related to cryptographic and distributed ledger technology is ongoing throughout the Administration,” the document said.

binance,Business,Binance Freezes Doge Withdrawals as Users Report Being Asked to Return Coins They Don’t Have ,"Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, has temporarily suspended withdrawals of DOGE following an upgrade, the company said Thursday. “We discovered a minor issue with DOGE network withdrawals on Binance after carrying out a  version update  on 2021-11-10,”  Binance said in a post on Thursday morning  without specifying what the “minor issue” was. “As a result, we have temporarily suspended DOGE network withdrawals until this issue is resolved. Binance is actively working with the DOGE project team to resolve the issue.” But the upgrade appears to have created significant problems for some of Binance’s users. Those users claim that the crypto exchange first  initiated the withdrawal  of dogecoin without their consent, and is now asking the users to return the dogecoin  that they don’t have  in their Binance accounts. Screenshots shared with CoinDesk by several Binance users show that Binance asked them to return DOGE to the exchange, or else their withdrawal function on the exchange would remain deactivated. But the affected users said they didn’t even have any DOGE in their Binance accounts to return. In a tweet thread on Thursday by a  Twitter account representing dogecoin developers , the developers explained that the initial withdrawal transactions appear to have been follow-up attempts to carry out requested transactions from years ago that were “stuck” because of “insufficient fees.” The Dogecoin network upgrade initiated a few days ago appears to have triggered those old transactions, according to the tweet thread.

The Dogecoin developers claimed that they tried to work with Binance when the exchange first reached out over a year ago on the “stuck transactions,” but they “were not notified as to whether or not [Binance] followed” their instructions to fix the problem.

binance,Business,DOGE Users Seethe Over Binance’s 2-Week Withdrawal Freeze,"Binance, the largest crypto exchange in the world by daily trading volume, is trying to fix a technical issue triggered by a software upgrade last week that resulted in a number of  erroneous dogecoin transactions . Binance said the DOGE must be returned by the users or they won’t be able to withdraw or use funds on their balances. The problem, users say, is they  don’t have access  to those dogecoins they sent two years ago, and in some cases don’t even know where those coins ended up. “Due to the complex nature of the issue, we expect DOGE network withdrawals to be suspended for the next 10 to 14 days” as of Nov. 15, an according to an  updated blog post  by Binance on Monday. However, some users told CoinDesk they can’t withdraw any of the crypto they have in their accounts. The news is a fresh reminder of the old paradox that, while cryptocurrencies are decentralized by design, centralized services dominating this market are in full control of users’ funds. Or, in the words of the old saying, “not your keys – not your coins.” How a Dogecoin upgrade triggered a Binance glitch The problems have been ongoing since last week, when some Binance users found all their withdrawals  frozen due to a technical glitch . On Thursday, Binance  wrote  in the company blog that the exchange “discovered a minor issue with DOGE network withdrawals on Binance after carrying out a  version update”  on Nov. 10. “As a result, we have temporarily suspended DOGE network withdrawals until this issue is resolved. Binance is actively working with the DOGE project team to resolve the issue,” the blog post said. The same day, users started reaching out to CoinDesk to complain their entire accounts were frozen due to transactions they had not initiated. In the meantime, Dogecoin developers published a  thread  on their Twitter account Thursday explaining that due to the latest software update, old transactions that were stuck on the network due to insufficient fees had been automatically resent. Last week, the devs released an upgrade that imposed “a new minimum fee recommendation” for all participants on the network, the  GitHub page  dedicated to the update said. Therefore, the old, unsuccessful transactions could have been sent anew, even though the users themselves did not initiate them. “We instructed Binance to use the inputs to the stuck transactions to force them to be invalidated by the replacement transactions. We were not notified as to whether or not they followed these instructions,” the thread  said . ‘Locked temporarily’ On Monday, the exchange sent emails to the affected users, reiterated the demand them to return the DOGE and later repeating it in a  blog post : “We have written directly via email to the very small number of users directly impacted by the upgrade where previously failed DOGE withdrawals transactions got resent after the recent update that was done on 11-10-2021. Please note that no asset is debited from users account for the resent withdrawal transactions. We are kindly requesting those users to return the asset,” said an email from Binance shared with CoinDesk by a user named Javid. Back in 2019, Javid sent DOGE from his Binance account to several different addresses, one of which belonged to himself – those DOGE he returned right away, Javid said. However, Binance now wants him to retrieve the tokens from other addresses Javid doesn’t control, he said, as a condition for unblocking his withdrawals. “We will now reinstate your withdrawal function, but a portion of your assets equivalent to the DOGE amount sent out will be still locked temporarily,” according to a screenshot of a customer support chat, shared by another user in a Telegram chat of participants affected by the incident. Some users said they do not have as much DOGE in their accounts as they once did. Furthermore, their entire balances are worth less than the DOGE they “owe” Binance now. DOGE has appreciated around 200 times since November 2017, which makes paying back the asset even harder than it would have been. “I have $2,500 on my account and they want $7,300 from me [to unfreeze withdrawals],” Dmitri, another affected user with a Telegram handle twenty_one_percent, told CoinDesk. He also shared screenshots of his chat with Binance customer support, where he was told he needed to find the person to whom he sent DOGE back in 2019 and return the funds. “I used to cash out via various OTCs [over-the counter trades] often, so I had dozens of transactions like that, and I have no idea what was that address and whom it belongs to,” Dmitri said. “I tried to find those transactions in my emails but couldn’t find them. I’m not sure I used the same email back then.” According to the Telegram group of affected users, a couple of people were able to withdraw their funds. However, on Monday afternoon UTC, most of the group, counting 26 members now, have been waiting to regain access to their crypto since Thursday.

binance,Business,"US Senate Banking Panel Head Seeks More Information About Stablecoins From Issuers, Exchanges","The head of the U.S. Senate banking committee sent letters on Tuesday to stablecoin issuers and exchanges seeking information on how companies are protecting consumers and investors amid the risks highlighted in the recent report by the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets. Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio), chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, said consumers and investors may not understand how stablecoins work and the risks involved. “I have significant concerns with the non-standardized terms applicable to redemption of particular stablecoins, how those terms differ from traditional assets, and how those terms may not be consistent across digital asset trading platforms,” Brown wrote in his letter to Circle, the payment services company that operates stablecoin USD coin (USDC). After publication of this article, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire tweeted that he was looking forward to “responding and working with you to ensure consumers are appropriately protected.” Brown also sent letters to cryptocurrency exchanges Coinbase, Gemini and  Binance.US , as well as blockchain infrastructure firm Paxos, which operates the USDP stablecoin;  decentralized finance  company TrustToken, which operates the TUSD stablecoin; and Centre, the Coinbase- and Circle-founded project that oversees the USDC stablecoin. The  report  compiled by the President’s Working Group, along with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is the first step toward establishing federal-level regulatory oversight of the stablecoin sector in the U.S. The regulators behind the report called on Congress to bring stablecoins under federal supervision. The report indicated that should lawmakers fail to do so, the regulators themselves may step in through the interagency Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), which could designate stablecoin activities “systemically important” and thus subject to tighter supervision.

binance,Business,Binance Reports Resolving Issue With Its DOGE Wallet,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, said on Monday it has resolved technical issues with its dogecoin wallet that resulted in users’ accounts being frozen. The reason for the more than two-week long debacle was an unfortunate coincidence of events, “not quite the shady circumstances that some had suggested,” the exchange wrote in a  blog post . “No single entity was at fault,” the exchange wrote, and “no one’s getting fired.” Earlier in November, the exchange implemented a software update for the popular meme coin, and the update  triggered a glitch : Old users’ transactions from 2019 were re-played, and Binance re-sent DOGE from its wallet to the same addresses that users withdrew their coins to back in 2019. Binance  said  1,634 users were affected by this issue. As a result, the exchange lost some funds from its treasury, so it then turned back to users whose transactions were replayed and asked them to return the DOGE. However, the users didn’t even know their old transactions had been repeated, and some of them didn’t even have any DOGE in their accounts anymore,  they told CoinDesk . Binance told those users they had to return the coins; otherwise, any crypto on their balance equivalent to the amount erroneously sent by the exchange would be frozen. One week later,  Elon Musk tweeted at Changpeng Zhao , CEO of Binance, saying that the situation “sounds shady.” Soon after that, Binance published an update saying it was  rebuilding its dogecoin wallet . In today’s blog post, the exchange blamed the issue on “a combination of unlikely factors” related to the dogecoin blockchain upgrade from the previous version. “What began as a fairly straightforward upgrade, turned into an issue where Binance users were unable to withdraw DOGE for the last 17 days,” the exchange said. According to the affected users, who have been exchanging updates in a dedicated Telegram group, most of them finally got their accounts unfrozen at some point last week. However, one user told CoinDesk that he’s still waiting for his situation to be resolved.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2021/11/29/binance-reports-resolving-issue-with-its-doge-wallet/,coindesk,2021-11-29,14:12:00,en,343,2082,5.052478134110787,138,0.40233236151603496,binance world largest cryptocurrency exchange resolved technical issue dogecoin wallet resulted user account frozen reason debacle unfortunate coincidence event shady circumstance suggested exchange wrote blog single entity fault exchange wrote fired earlier exchange implemented software update popular meme coin update triggered glitch user transaction played binance doge wallet address user withdrew coin binance user affected issue result exchange lost fund treasury turned user transaction replayed asked return doge user transaction repeated doge account anymore told coindesk binance told user return coin crypto balance equivalent amount erroneously exchange frozen elon musk tweeted changpeng ceo binance situation sound shady binance published update rebuilding dogecoin wallet today blog exchange blamed issue combination factor related dogecoin blockchain upgrade previous version began fairly straightforward upgrade turned issue binance user unable withdraw doge day exchange affected user exchanging update dedicated telegram group finally account unfrozen point user told coindesk waiting situation resolved,-0.06164965986394557,negative,0.5289965986394558,"{'neg': 0.109, 'neu': 0.809, 'pos': 0.082, 'compound': -0.6705}",-0.6705,0.109,0.809,0.082,negative,-0.33333329629630043,0.06249999956597223,negative
binance, News , Binance introduces BNB Auto-Burn to replace quarterly burn protocol ,"Binance officially  announced  the implementation of a new Binance Coin ( BNB ) Auto-Burn protocol to replace its current quarterly burn mechanism.  In response to the requests of the BNB community, Binance changed its quarterly burning protocol for BNB tokens. According to Binance, this will provide more “transparency and predictability” to its community. With this, BNB will be burned automatically based on a formula consisting of on-chain data of total blocks generated and the average price of BNB.  At the moment, there are two burning mechanisms for BNB. One is the real-time burning of a percentage of gas fees on the Binance Smart Chain. The second is the quarterly burn based on Binance’s Accelerated Burn Program, which the BNB Auto-Burn mechanism would replace. Since the launch of BNB, Binance has committed to burning 100 million BNB, which is half of the original total supply. When the total circulating supply of BNB goes below 100 million, the Auto-Burn will be discontinued.  In the last quarterly burn, the company took 1,335,888 BNB, approximately $639,462,868 at the time, out of circulation. Earlier this year, the team  destroyed $400 million  worth of BNB tokens in the 16th quarterly burn event.  At the time of writing, BNB is trading down less than 10% on the month at $528. It’s down 23.65% from its all-time high of $690.93 back on May 10, 2021, but is still up by 1,295% since the start of 2021.

binance, Altcoin Watch , 3 reasons why Cosmos (ATOM) price is near a new all-time high ,"Blockchain network interoperability is shaping up to be one of the main themes for the cryptocurrency ecosystem in 2022. New users are continuing to onboard into the growing world of crypto while both new and established projects search for the chain that will best serve the needs of their protocol and community.  One project that has 2022 off to a bullish start, thanks to its focus on facilitating the communication between separate networks, is Cosmos ( ATOM ). This project bills itself as “the internet of blockchains” and seeks to facilitate the development of an interconnected decentralized economy. Data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  and  TradingView  shows that since hitting a low of $25.06 on Dec. 30, the price of ATOM has rallied 75% to hit a daily high at $43.98 on Jan. 4 as its 24-hour trading volume spiked to $2.54 billion. ATOM/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingView Three reasons for the surging price of ATOM are the launch of a cross-chain bridge, which makes the protocol Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible and an upcoming Theta upgrade, which will rapidly expand the ecosystem of connected chains and applications. Cosmos nears EVM compatibility The most significant development that has provided a boost to ATOM is the rollout of Evmos, an EVM-compatible protocol that will allow assets and projects that operate on the Ethereum ( ETH ) network to migrate over to the Cosmos ecosystem. @EvmosOrg  is an application-agnostic  @cosmos  chain ⚛️ @EvmosOrg  will be interoperable with  @Ethereum , EVM-compatible environments, and other chains via IBC, making it easy to move value across chains ⛓ Learn about  @EvmosOrg  network architecture  https://t.co/VfDiYxVkte   pic.twitter.com/20iMai6B3Z — Figment (@Figment_io)  December 7, 2021 Up to this point, there had not been a way for Ethereum-based projects to interact with the Cosmos ecosystem. This significantly limited the number of projects and tokens that could interact with decentralized finance (DeFi) and nonfungible token (NFT) projects in the Cosmos ecosystem. Gravity Bridge,  which launched on Dec. 15 , is another project dedicated to facilitating the bridging of assets between Ethereum and Cosmos and it currently operates as a standalone chain. Plans to migrate to the Cosmos Hub in early 2022 are currently underway. Preparing for the Theta upgrade A second development that has put wind in the sails of Cosmos is the protocol's upcoming Theta upgrade, which is scheduled for March 31. Some of the new features included in the upgrade are the addition of meta-transactions where transactions can be submitted by separate accounts that receive tips and the introduction of inter-chain accounts, which allow users to manage accounts across multiple blockchains. Another feature is liquid staking, a system where users utilize the value of staked assets in other parts of the Cosmos ecosystem. The Theta upgrade also includes NFT modules, which enable the simple management of NFT identifiers, their owners and associated data. Related:  ROSE gains 54% in a week as Oasis Network ecosystem expands Expanding ecosystems are typically bullish A third reason for the bullish momentum of ATOM is the ecosystem's expansion to 28 live, interconnected chains that total more than $68 billion in total value. Cosmos is the only cross-chain ecosystem in the world that uses an interoperability standard. #CosmosFacts https://t.co/HwBEUuchyP   pic.twitter.com/9b9YRyLfVS — Cosmos - Internet of Blockchains ⚛️ (@cosmos)  December 30, 2021 Some of the more established chains that have joined the Cosmos ecosystem are the Binance Smart Chain, Terra ( LUNA ) and Crypto.com ( CRO ), while the biggest projects using Cosmos' software development kit (SDK) include Osmosis (OSMO), Secret (SCRT), Oasis Network (ROSE) and Kava (KAVA). As the bridge protocols linking Cosmos with other EVM-compatible networks are established, the number of chains connected to the Cosmos Hub is likely to increase. This will bring an increase in the total value of the ecosystem along with it.

binance,Markets,Binance Destroys 1.6M BNB Tokens in First-Ever Auto Burn,"Cryptocurrency exchange Binance implemented its first-ever binance token (BNB) auto-burn program last quarter, removing over 1.6 million BNB tokens worth $750 million from circulation. Under the new program, the number of tokens to be burned is arrived at using a formula based on the total number of blocks produced on the Binance Smart Chain, a programmable blockchain powering smart contracts and running parallel to Binance Chain, and BNB's average dollar-denominated price during the quarter. The move away from the previous token burn methodology, which was based on revenue generated from the Binance centralized exchange, is expected to make the process more objective and clear to the BNB community. ""The implementation of the BNB auto-burn is a natural next step in BNB’s journey and will help the BNB community grow through providing greater autonomy, transparency, and predictability,” Changpeng Zhao, co-founder and CEO of Binance, said in an  official announcement  published on the Binance blog. Binance's BNB auto-burn formula (Binance) Binance is committed to destroying 100 million BNB tokens, amounting to 50% of the circulating supply, through quarterly burns.  According to  data source Coin Tools, the exchange has destroyed nearly 35 million tokens via quarterly burns to date, having begun the program in late 2017. Token burns are supposedly deflationary and usually meant to bring a store of value appeal to the cryptocurrency. In traditional finance, deflation means a consistent price decline. In crypto, a deflationary token is the one whose circulating supply will decrease over time, thus making it inflation-resistant or store of value asset. ""BNB is deflationary,""  Zhao tweeted  early Tuesday along with the BNB burn news. However, the 18th burn, the first-ever automated event, announced on Monday, has failed to put a bid under the cryptocurrency. At press time, BNB was trading flat on the day near $474, having dropped over 4% on Monday.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/18/binance-destroys-16m-bnb-tokens-in-first-ever-auto-burn/,coindesk,2022-01-18,07:31:00,en,305,1975,5.459016393442623,103,0.3377049180327869,cryptocurrency exchange binance implemented binance token bnb auto burn program removing bnb token circulation program number token burned arrived formula based total number block produced binance chain programmable blockchain powering contract running parallel binance chain bnb average denominated move previous token burn methodology based revenue generated binance centralized exchange expected make process objective clear bnb community implementation bnb auto burn natural step bnb journey bnb community providing greater autonomy transparency predictability changpeng founder ceo binance official announcement published binance blog binance bnb auto burn formula binance binance committed destroying bnb token amounting circulating supply data source coin tool exchange destroyed token begun program late token supposedly deflationary meant bring store appeal cryptocurrency traditional finance deflation consistent decline crypto deflationary token circulating supply decrease time making inflation resistant store asset bnb deflationary tweeted bnb burn news burn automated event announced failed put bid cryptocurrency press time bnb trading flat dropped,-0.032777777777777774,negative,0.3416666666666667,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.832, 'pos': 0.089, 'compound': -0.296}",-0.296,0.078,0.832,0.089,neutral,-0.636363578512402,0.08029197021684693,negative
binance, Altcoin Watch , Here’s why Binance Coin is 33% down from its all-time high ,"Binance Coin ( BNB ) holders enjoyed a 1,760% rally from $37 to $692 between January and May 2021, but as is customary in crypto, this surge was followed by a 69% correction two weeks later.  From there, it’s been a bit of a rough patch to regain investors' confidence and BNB failed to produce another all-time high in November even though the aggregate cryptocurrency market capitalization peaked at $3 trillion. Binance Coin / USDT at Binance. Source: TradingView In addition to being 33% down from its all-time high, BNB investors have other reasons to question whether the current $465 price is sustainable. Especially since traders were recently paying up to 3% per week to keep futures' short positions open, betting on the downside. Traders flipped bearish on January 10 Unlike regular monthly contracts, perpetual futures prices are very similar to those at regular spot exchanges. This makes the process for retail traders a lot easier because they no longer need to calculate the futures premium or manually roll over positions near expiry. The funding rate allows this magic to occur, and it is charged from longs (buyers) when they demand more leverage. However, when the situation is reversed and shorts (sellers) are over-leveraged, the funding rate goes negative and they become the ones paying the fee. BNB 8-hour USDT/USD margin futures funding rate. Source: Coinglass.com Notice how the funding rate on BNB futures was mostly flat between Dec. 15 and Jan. 10, but then quickly shifted to negative 0.13%. This rate is equivalent to 2.8% per week, a relatively high cost for shorts (sellers) to keep their positions. The movement happened while BNB tested the $410 support, its lowest price in 90 days. Excessive premium versus competing blockchains The reason behind the Binance short could be the excessive premium versus competing smart-contract chains. For example, BNB’s $78.2 billion market capitalization is 80% higher than Solana’s ( SOL ) $43.3 billion. Moreover, the premium versus Terra’s ( LUNA ) $28.2 billion is 178%, and 275% compared to Avalanche’s ( AVAX ) $20.8 billion. Another factor in play could also be Binance Smart Chain's total value locked (TVL), stagnating at $15 billion. Binance Chain TVL in USD. Source: DefiLlama.com For comparison, Terra's TVL increased from $9 billion to $19 billion in three months, while Avalanche grew from $6.5 billion to $11.6 billion in the same period. The competition has vastly surpassed Binance Chain's applications, except for the number of active users on PancakeSwap decentralized exchange. To correctly assess whether Binance Smart Chain use has topped, one must analyze the network's activity. Some decentralized applications (DApps) like games, social and NFT marketplaces require little total value locked (TVL) deposited on smart contracts. Binace Smart Chain daily transactions per day. Source: bscscan.com Data shows that daily transactions on BSC peaked above 15 million on Nov. 25 and are recently averaging 6.5 million per day. One should also note that Binance Chain's main competitor Ethereum has been struggling with $40 or higher average transaction fees, which creates the perfect scenario for competing chains.  Despite this opportunity to seize market share, Binance Smart Chain seems to have flatlined in terms of daily transactions and TVL, both of which are signs of growth and adoption. Binance's lead derivatives position could be challenged The competition for Binance's leading position might be challenged as Coinbase, America's largest crypto exchange, plans to begin  offering derivatives trading  after the acquisition of FairX.  Moreover, FTX exchange  raised $1.32 billion  from private investors and FTX US finalized its acquisition of crypto options exchange LedgerX on Oct. 25. This solidifies its plans to offer derivatives contracts for U.S. investors. There's a good chance that Binance will keep its leadership versus Coinbase and FTX derivatives considering that it has the first-mover advantage. Furthermore, Binance launched a  $1 billion development fund  on Oct. 12 to expand the capabilities of the Binance Smart Chain ecosystem. Overvalued or not, solid fundamentals are backing the third-largest cryptocurrency and while the short-term price performance is not promising, there are still plenty of future catalysts for growth.

binance,Tech,Trezor Adopts Swiss Travel Rule Protocol for Private Crypto Wallets,"An automated way of sharing proof that a user owns a private cryptocurrency wallet when transacting with a regulated exchange in Switzerland is being integrated by hardware wallet Trezor. Developed by  crypto startup 21 Analytics,  the Address Ownership Proof Protocol ( AOPP ), which also works with wallets like BitBox and Edge, was designed to accommodate the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority's (FINMA) implementation of anti-money laundering  (AML) requirements for cryptocurrency firms.  Going beyond the recommendations made by global AML watchdog, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), crypto requirements in Switzerland include the identification of private wallets transacting with the country’s virtual asset service providers (VASPs). The march of AML requirements into the realm of private or non-custodial wallets is something most countries are only at the initial stage of mulling over – often  to the horror of crypto advocates . But Switzerland and Singapore are already requiring identification for transactions over $1,000 with what the FATF calls “unhosted wallets.” “Switzerland has some extra harsh regulations when it comes to the 'travel rule,' and FINMA was always at the forefront implementing everything the FATF publishes very quickly,” 21 Analytics CEO Lucas Betschart said in an interview. “So we have the Travel Rule actually being enforced here.” When it comes to determining ownership of private wallets, VASPs in Switzerland have been asking users to submit a screenshot of their wallet, or conduct a “Satoshi Test,” whereby a specific amount of coins is sent to a verified wallet to confirm their receipt. Another way is manual signing in using a private key, Betschart said. AOPP streamlines and automates that manual signing process, he added. “We’re glad to see more individuals taking custody of their crypto assets,” Marek Palatinus, CEO of SatoshiLabs, the maker of the Trezor hardware wallet, said in a statement. “AOPP makes it simpler and faster for users to withdraw to the safest place for their coins: their Trezor.” Betschart also pointed out that 95% of transactions from Swiss VASPs don’t go to another Swiss VASP, but rather to a top 20 crypto exchange such as Binance, BitMEX or Bitfinex, most of which have no travel rule solution in place yet. The result is that customers of Swiss VASPs send and receive a lot of crypto via their own non-custodial wallets, often using AOPP, Betschart said. “It’s an interesting effect of activating the travel rule in Switzerland that more people are forced to use their own wallet,” Betschart said. “So it’s not like everyone is sharing data, but just that everyone is sending to their own wallet before they can send assets to Binance, for example.” UPDATE (Jan. 27, 13:18 UTC) : Removes sub phrase ""which is obviously a security risk"" in the second line of the sixth paragraph.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/01/27/trezor-adopts-swiss-travel-rule-protocol-for-private-crypto-wallets/,coindesk,2022-01-27,12:50:00,en,459,2883,5.272331154684096,174,0.3790849673202614,automated sharing proof user owns private cryptocurrency wallet transacting regulated exchange switzerland integrated hardware wallet trezor developed crypto startup analytics address ownership proof protocol aopp work wallet bitbox designed accommodate swiss financial market supervisory authority finma implementation anti laundering aml requirement cryptocurrency firm recommendation made global aml watchdog financial action task force fatf crypto requirement switzerland include identification private wallet transacting country virtual asset service provider vasps aml requirement realm private custodial wallet country initial stage mulling horror crypto advocate switzerland singapore requiring identification transaction fatf call unhosted wallet switzerland extra harsh regulation travel finma forefront implementing fatf publishes quickly analytics ceo betschart interview travel enforced determining ownership private wallet vasps switzerland user submit screenshot wallet conduct satoshi test specific amount coin verified wallet confirm receipt signing private betschart aopp streamlines automates signing process added glad individual taking custody crypto asset palatinus ceo satoshilabs maker trezor hardware wallet statement aopp make simpler faster user withdraw safest coin trezor betschart pointed transaction swiss vasps swiss vasp top crypto exchange binance bitmex bitfinex travel solution result customer swiss vasps send receive lot crypto custodial wallet aopp betschart interesting effect activating travel switzerland people forced wallet betschart sharing data sending wallet send asset binance update utc remove phrase security risk line paragraph,0.06349206349206349,positive,0.3190476190476191,"{'neg': 0.057, 'neu': 0.77, 'pos': 0.173, 'compound': 0.9788}",0.9788,0.057,0.77,0.173,positive,-0.33333327777778704,0.03191489344726121,negative
binance,Business,Mobile-First Blockchain Celo Launches Stablecoin Tied to Brazilian Real,"Phone-focused blockchain Celo launched cREAL, a stablecoin pegged to Brazil's local currency, the real. As of Thursday, cREAL will be available on Brazil-based crypto exchanges Ripio, FlowBTC and NovaDAX. Crypto wallets Bitfy and Coins will also support the stablecoin. NovaDAX users will be able to spend cREAL with the prepaid crypto card issued by the crypto exchange. Bitfy customers will be able to use the cREAL throughout the Cielo network, Brazil's largest credit and debit card operator, the company said in a press release Thursday. The cREAL was proposed and then approved by the owners of Celo's native digital asset CELO and governors of the blockchain, Celo's co-founder and Celo Foundation President Rene Reinsberg told CoinDesk. Celo, a proof-of-stake and open-source blockchain, already has cUSD and cEUR stablecoins, pegged to the U.S. dollar and the euro respectively. ""There was a lot of excitement for crypto in Brazil,"" Reinsberg said. ""But specifically in the Celo community, we have seen a lot of teams built on Celo, integrated with Celo, using cUSD. From the outset, Brazil was obviously one of the strongest markets in terms of adoption."" According to Celo, cREAL works as a decentralized, crypto-collateralized algorithmic stablecoin that can be used for decentralized (CeFi) and decentralized finance (DeFi) apps and services on the Celo blockchain, such as the lending protocol Moola Market, the decentralized exchange Ubeswap or Valora, a mobile-first digital wallet native to the Celo network. ""The rate of cryptocurrency adoption in high-growth markets – in particular Brazil – not only signals growing excitement for this new digital economy, but the advance of real-world use cases,"" Celo Foundation’s Latam lead Camila Rioja said in a statement. Brazilians are turning to cryptocurrencies and, in particular,  stablecoins  amid record inflation and a devaluation of their local currency.  According to Receita Federal, the Brazilian tax authority , between January and November 2021, locals traded $11.4 billion in stablecoins and almost tripled the total traded in 2020. Looking to take advantage of that crypto boom, several global exchanges, including  Binance, Coinbase and Crypto.com see the country as Latin America’s main market in 2022 . In Brazil, Celo currently supports projects such as ImpactMarket, a universal basic income program built on its blockchain that delivered blockchain-based aid to 10,000 beneficiaries in the Latin American country up to now, Reinsberg said. In December, Kickstarter announced that it was  creating an open-source protocol to release a decentralized version of Kickstarter’s core functionality on the Celo blockchain .",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/01/27/mobile-first-blockchain-celo-launches-stablecoin-tied-to-brazilian-real/,coindesk,2022-01-27,12:00:00,en,410,2698,5.570731707317073,142,0.3463414634146341,phone focused blockchain celo launched creal stablecoin pegged local currency creal based crypto exchange ripio flowbtc novadax crypto wallet bitfy coin support stablecoin novadax user spend creal prepaid crypto issued crypto exchange bitfy customer creal cielo network largest credit debit operator company press release creal proposed approved owner celo native digital asset celo governor blockchain celo founder celo foundation president reinsberg told coindesk celo proof stake open source blockchain cusd ceur stablecoins pegged euro lot excitement crypto reinsberg specifically celo community lot team built celo integrated celo cusd outset strongest market term adoption celo creal work decentralized crypto collateralized algorithmic stablecoin decentralized cefi decentralized finance defi apps service celo blockchain lending protocol moola market decentralized exchange ubeswap valora mobile digital wallet native celo network rate cryptocurrency adoption growth market signal growing excitement digital economy advance world case celo foundation latam lead rioja statement brazilian turning cryptocurrencies stablecoins amid record inflation devaluation local currency receita federal brazilian tax authority local traded stablecoins tripled total traded advantage crypto boom global exchange including binance coinbase crypto country latin market celo support project impactmarket universal basic income program built blockchain delivered blockchain based aid beneficiary latin american country reinsberg kickstarter announced creating open source protocol release decentralized version kickstarter functionality celo blockchain,0.0,neutral,0.14423076923076922,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.829, 'pos': 0.171, 'compound': 0.9868}",0.9868,0.0,0.829,0.171,positive,0.599999940000006,0.051546391486874274,positive
binance, News , Binance user protection insurance fund reaches $1B valuation ,"Binance, the world’s leading crypto exchange by trading volume,  announced  its Secure Asset Fund for Users (SAFU) reached a $1 billion valuation. The user protection insurance fund was set up in July 2018 to protect users’ interests. Binance committed a portion of the trading fee towards SAFU and began allocating 10% towards the funds. The crypto exchange also revealed the two wallet addresses where the funds are being held to ensure transparency. The two wallets contain a billion-dollar worth of crypto in Binance USD (BUSD), Binance Coin ( BNB ) and Bitcoin ( BTC ). Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, urged other crypto platforms to follow on their footpath and reveal the details of their emergency insurance funds as well. He said that doing so would make them more transparent and also help them to showcase their commitment to regulators. Responding to the queries from Cointelegraph, a Binance spokesperson revealed that the SAFU is meant to protect users' interests and funds are used at Binance's discretion. He went on to add that SAFU is focused on, but not limited to Binance.com. He explained: ""The purpose of SAFU is to protect Binance users and we reserve the right to cover issues outside of Binance.com if required."" In the absence of clear regulations, crypto investors and traders in many countries are solely dependent on crypto exchanges' security measures to safeguard their funds. However, some of the most notable crypto platforms have been hacked despite the promised security, with millions in user funds getting lost. Thus, the role of user insurance funds becomes very critical. Related:  The biggest crypto heists of all time While decentralized exchanges and protocols have been the primary target of hackers for the ease of heist, however, that doesn’t make centralized exchanges any safer.

binance,Opinion,"This Super Bowl, Don’t Trust Celebrity Crypto Endorsements (Don’t Trust Yourself, Either)","Global crypto exchange Binance is warning against celebrity crypto endorsements during the upcoming National Football League Super Bowl championship game,  according to AdAge . In a social media teaser of a new Binance ad campaign, National Basketball Association player Jimmy Butler encourages viewers to steer clear of celebs and instead “trust yourself” and “do your own research.” At least two crypto commercials, from FTX and Crypto.com, are expected to run during the big game on Feb. 13. There’s significant irony to using a celebrity influencer to warn against celebrity influence – but the message itself seems positive, right? Celebrities taking big checks to give fake investment advice should be tarred and feathered. “Do your own research” is hard to argue against as a principle. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full  newsletter here . The problem, unfortunately, is that the “you” doing the research is a gigantic idiot. I certainly don’t mean you individually – perish the thought. You’re reading CoinDesk so I’m sure you’re very sharp. But statistically, there’s a lot of idiocy floating around, and a lot of people willing to take advantage of it. Many grifters, fakes and other bad actors have been drawn to the crypto industry, and the “do your own research” ethos can leave their marks particularly vulnerable. The average American, to pluck just one indicator out of a hat, reads at a  seventh- to eighth-grade level . Telling that person to “do your own research” on crypto could lead them down some deep, dark rabbit holes. That isn’t just a roll of the dice: The most disreputable crypto projects often spend a lot of money on marketing and public relations, so people who actively “do their own research” are probably more likely to be scammed than those who just bought some random PFP (“profile pic”) on OpenSea because Jay-Z told them to. Part of that is thanks to data harvesters like Facebook and Google. Using Google to search for something like “best crypto investments” is the equivalent of covering yourself in fish guts before diving into  shark-infested waters . See also:  Don’t Listen to Celebrities Shilling Crypto, Says Binance Celebrity Ad For instance, all the people who invested in the OHM system did their own research (  it’s down 95% https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/Olympus ). So did everyone who invested in Wonderland (whose chief financial officer was secretly a  career financial con-man ). Observing the Wonderland community in particular over the past few days, it seems clear many buyers were not just financially but emotionally invested in the project, creating a cult-like sense of uncritical support even after clear malfeasance had been admitted. That drives home a disturbing parallel: “Do your own research,” in so many words, is also core to the ethos of the QAnon conspiracy theory movement. Much like QAnon, many corners of the crypto universe capitalize on people’s desire to have secret knowledge, to know something before the masses – to be able to see themselves as smart, whether or not they actually are. For QAnon, the supposed “secret” is a fabricated child-abduction ring (itself a  tragic distraction  from real child exploitation). In crypto, the secret is usually some supposed technical or incentive innovation that in many cases is just obfuscating a Ponzi scheme. The key, in the end, is to “do your own research” the right way, and that’s, frankly, extremely difficult in crypto. First, there’s the significant intellectual challenge of grasping how blockchain works. It’s a long road and there are no shortcuts if you want to be able to genuinely evaluate whether a particular project can actually do what it’s promising. A lot of initial coin offerings circa 2017-2018, for instance, exploited knowledge gaps by pitching use cases where blockchain or cryptocurrency simply weren’t relevant. (CoinDesk’s Learn series is a good way to start  honing your self-defense skills .) That kind of blunt misrepresentation is slightly less common today – more often, bad DAO (decentralized autonomous organization) or decentralized exchange projects hide their real intent in hypercomplex tokenomics. Here again “do your own research” is problematic because it presumes either high-grade code analysis skills or a level of transparency that simply doesn’t exist in the crypto world. If you’re investing in a publicly traded stock, you can easily download years’ worth of financial reports that can be at least somewhat trusted thanks to regulators like the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. With that backstop, you can indeed do your own research. It’s why r/WallStreetBets can occasionally spot things professional analysts miss. The data is available, and fairly trustworthy. But there’s no equivalent in crypto, despite some transparency efforts. Everything a project writes about itself, from information about founders to the goals of the project and even some financial data, can be completely made up. The people behind the worst projects actively avoid jurisdictions where they might face consequences for any of this, or simply conceal their identity.

binance, Newsletter , Altcoin Roundup: 3 P2E games that don't need Ethereum to make waves ,"The rise of blockchain-based play-to-earn (P2E) gaming was one of the leading stories in 2021 as games such as Axie Infinity exploded in popularity and players realized that they could make life-changing amounts of money while also having fun.  Weekly number of games by blockchain. Source: Footprint Analytics According to data from Footprint Analytics, the Ethereum network remains the leader when it comes to the number of games launched on-chain, but persistently high fees and network congestion have pushed a growing number of players to layer-2, cross-chain, bridge-supporting networks and competing blockchains that offer lower-cost transactions costs.  Here’s a look at a few non-Ethereum blockchain networks that are gaining traction for their P2E offerings and some of the games that are attracting the largest number of users.  Harmony According to  data  from Footprint Analytics, the most active blockchain network in terms of daily volume is Harmony, a protocol that uses random state sharding to help the network scale and facilitate the creation and use of decentralized applications.  Daily volume by blockchain and game. Source: Footprint Analytics As shown in the graphic above, the Harmony network has been processing a daily average of $22.26 million worth of transactions as compared to the $14 million being conducted on the Ronin sidechain, which is home to Axie Infinity.  The  most popular game on Harmony is DeFi Kingdoms , a project that combines the world of decentralized finance (DeFi) with P2E gaming and nonfungible tokens (NFT) to offer a unique playing experience.  Similar to Axie Infinity’s dominance on Ronin, DeFi Kingdoms is currently the main gaming option on Harmony, but the protocol’s ability to handle the high demand that the game places on the network could help attract other projects in the future. Polygon Polygon is another leading option for fans of P2E gaming, and the  layer-2 scaling solution  for Ethereum is currently processing an average of $10.35 million in daily volume for its gaming community.  According to  data  provided by DappRadar, the most popular game on the Polygon network is Pegaxy, a free-to-play mech-horse racing game where users enter mythological creatures called Pega into player-versus-player races to compete for a chance to win monetary rewards.  User statistics for Pegaxy. Source: DappRadar Some of the other popular games on the Polygon network include the DeFi-focused NFT game Aavegotchi, Arc8 by Gamee and Revv Racing.  Binance Smart Chain Following closely behind the gaming activity on Polygon is the  Binance Smart Chain  (BSC), which has a current daily volume of $7.26 million transacted within its gaming community.  According to  data  provided by DappRadar, the most popular games on BSC include Elfin Kingdom, Bomb Crypto, Metaverse Miner, Alien Worlds and Mobox: NFT Farmer.  Top 5 games on BSC by volume.

Algorand and Solana are two of the more popular up-and-comers, with each currently averaging $138,095 and $98,099 in volume, respectively.  The WAX blockchain is also a strong contender with  data  from WAX Market Cap showing that the network process an average daily volume of $1.07 million, thanks in part to its  large community of gamers  to go along with being the fifth-ranked network in terms of the number of games launched on network, according to  data  from Footprint Analytics Market share of gamers.

binance, News , Binance Smart Chain and Binance Chain become BNB Chain ,"Decentralized blockchain ecosystem Binance Smart Chain (BSC) announced on Tuesday that the Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain are uniting under a new name, BNB Chain, in a bid to reflect their connection with the native token of the ecosystem Binance Coin ( BNB ). According to a press release provided to Cointelegraph, BNB now stands for “Build and Build” instead of short for Binance Coin. Powered by BNB, the BNB Chain will introduce advanced capabilities and focus on building Web3 infrastructure.  Under the freshly named BNB Chain umbrella, the chain governance part, the Binance Chain, where staking and voting happens, has become BNB Beacon Chain. Meanwhile, the Ethereum Virtual Machine-compatible, multichain-supporting Binance Smart Chain is simply named BNB Smart Chain, still shortened as BSC. The BNB Chain will bring all its Web3 development under the umbrella of MetaFi that will bring together developers and projects from the metaverse along with GameFi and SocialFi. The BNB Chain will bring large-scale applications and developer tools while expanding the validator set from 21 to 41 with a focus on scalability. Related:  Binance Invests $200M in Forbes to boost consumer knowledge on Bitcoin Samy Karim, ecosystem coordinator at BNB Chain, told Cointelegraph: “The BNB Chain community will benefit from the previously launched $1 billion in funds and receive financial and operational support, as well as an introduction to the industry’s leading experts, mentors, and investors. The ecosystem will bring a range of these programs from live mentorship events and workshops to hackathons and in-person meetings.” Binance Smart Chain was launched in September 2020 as an alternative to the Ethereum blockchain and mimicked the platform in its operation with a lower transaction cost and time of processing. In a short time span, BSC became a popular choice for decentralized finance (DeFi) developers and nonfungible token projects due to ease of operations, interoperability and low cost.

binance,Tech,‘Web3Memes’ Rugs $235K From Investors Five Hours After Issuance: PeckShield,"Developers behind Web3Memes (W3M), a Binance Smart Chain (BSC)-based meme coin, drained the token’s liquidity pools of nearly 625 Binance coins (BNB), blockchain security firm PeckShield said on Wednesday. The amount is worth $235,000 at the time of writing. PeckShield first reported the exploit in a tweet.  Blockchain  data  shows the token was created during early Asian hours and was listed on BSC-based PancakeSwap shortly afterward. W3M saw over 1,800 transactions in the following hours and over 1,000 holders at the time of writing. However, the anonymous developers pulled W3M’s trading liquidity some five hours after its issuance – causing the infamous rugpull, a crypto market lingo used to refer to such acts. Prices of W3M dumped from highs of $0.000000204 to under $0.00000000277 after the rugpull, a near 100% decrease. Web3memes prices fell nearly 100% after the rugpull. (PooCoin) Tokens like Web3Memes can be issued by anyone on BSC or other networks. Issuers can then pair such tokens with another popular token, such as tether (USDT) or BNB, and list the pair on a decentralized exchange by providing initial liquidity. The process is wholly automatic and relies on smart contracts instead of third parties or centralized entities. In 2021, over $2.8 billion in investors' funds were lost to rugpulls, as  reported . The figure accounted for 37% of all scam revenue during the year compared to just 1% in 2020.",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/02/23/web3memes-rugs-235k-from-investors-five-hours-after-issuance-peckshield/,coindesk,2022-02-23,06:18:00,en,231,1432,5.186147186147186,84,0.36363636363636365,developer web meme binance chain bsc based meme coin drained token liquidity pool binance coin bnb blockchain security firm peckshield amount time writing peckshield reported exploit tweet blockchain data show token created asian hour listed bsc based pancakeswap shortly afterward transaction hour holder time writing anonymous developer pulled trading liquidity hour issuance causing infamous rugpull crypto market lingo refer act price dumped high rugpull decrease web meme price rugpull poocoin token web meme issued bsc network issuer pair token popular token tether usdt bnb list pair decentralized exchange providing initial liquidity process wholly automatic relies contract party centralized entity investor fund lost rugpulls reported figure accounted scam revenue compared,0.008571428571428579,positive,0.4485714285714285,"{'neg': 0.103, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.081, 'compound': -0.4019}",-0.4019,0.103,0.816,0.081,neutral,-0.7142856122449125,0.06862745030757401,negative
binance,Policy,"Visa, Mastercard Join PayPal in Suspending Russian Operations","Visa (V), Mastercard (MA) and PayPal (PYPL) are all suspending operations in Russia, the companies announced Saturday, citing the country's ongoing invasion of Ukraine. Visa will begin working to discontinue transactions in Russia, but it will take a few days, according to  a press statement .  Mastercard said  it would suspend all its network services in Russia, which sent military forces into Ukraine at the end of February. ""Once complete, all transactions initiated with Visa cards issued in Russia will no longer work outside the country and any Visa cards issued by financial institutions outside of Russia will no longer work within the Russian Federation,"" said Visa's statement, which was attributed to Andy  Gerlt. global  communications vice president. In the press release, Visa Chairman and CEO Al Kelly said the company ""was compelled to act following Russia’s unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, and the unacceptable events that we have witnessed. We regret the impact this will have on our valued colleagues, and on the clients, partners, merchants and cardholders we serve in Russia. This war and the ongoing threat to peace and stability demand we respond in line with our values.” Similarly, Mastercard said that in addition to blocking some Russian financial institutions, it will end support for any cards issued by Russian banks and block transactions from cards issued outside Russia but used ""at Russian merchants or ATMs."" Earlier on Saturday, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov  tweeted a letter  sent by PayPal CEO Dan Schulman announcing a similar shutdown. Spokespeople for PayPal did not immediately return a request for comment, but  reportedly told Reuters  the shutdown would still ""ensure that account balances are dispersed in line with applicable laws."" Companies have been under public pressure to suspend operations in Russia due to its invasion of Ukraine. Crypto companies have by and large resisted calls for unilaterally blocking all Russian residents, despite entreaties from Ukrainian officials and lawmakers elsewhere. Jesse Powell, CEO of crypto exchange Kraken, said the company would do so  if legally compelled  (his exchange was not one Ukraine formally asked). Ukraine has asked Coinbase (COIN), Binance, Huobi, KuCoin, Bybit, Gate.io, Whitebit and Ukraine-based Kuna to block all Russian accounts. Russia's central bank said  in a statement  that Visa and Mastercard cards would continue to work within Russia after the credit card processors announced their suspensions. ""Operations on them are processed within the country in the National Payment Card System, and sanctions do not affect them,"" the central bank said. ""Customer funds on accounts linked to such cards are fully preserved and available."" Cross-border transactions are not expected to work.

The round was led by Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) with Multicoin Capital, 3 Arrows Capital, Tiger Global, FTX Ventures, Coinbase Ventures and more also signing checks. Aptos is among a handful of teams looking to bring the Diem (formerly Libra) blockchain to life outside of the watchful eye of Meta (formerly Facebook).  0L  is another project similarly looking to revive Diem, in part through its Carpe app. In a  second Aptos blog post  on Tuesday, the team sketched out some of its blockchain’s tech specs. Notably, Aptos said its devnet, meant for coders to contribute open-source code, is now live – with developers at big-name crypto firms offering their time. “There are great companies like Anchorage, Binance, Blockorus, Coinbase [COIN], Livepeer, Moonclave, Paxos, Paymagic, Rarible and Streaming Fast in our community already giving feedback, and contributing code on Devnet,” Aptos wrote. “We have worked with the Aptos founders over the last few years to bring to life the decentralized vision we both share,” Joe Lallouz, head of product at Coinbase Cloud told CoinDesk in an email. “We are incredibly excited to support them and their team with solutions and infrastructure to bring more participants and builders to the ecosystem.” (Coinbase was a  member of the Diem Association  from its launch in mid-2019.) In its blog post, Aptos ID’d “next-gen social media platforms, rich [non-fungible token] experiences, Web 3 games, creator-first media and entertainment businesses, cheap and secure payments, [decentralized finance]-integrated fintech products, and so much more,” as potential applications to live on Aptos.

binance,Markets,Ukraine Crypto Exchange Founder Accuses Binance of 'Cooperating' With the Russian Government,"Ukrainian crypto exchange KUNA founder Michael Chobanian claims the Binance crypto exchange is working with the Russian government despite global sanctions, and has been for some time. During an interview Friday on  CoinDesk TV's  ""First Mover,"" Chobanian said CEO Changpeng Zhao must decide on where Binance stands in dealing with Russia after its invasion of Ukraine in late February. ""The problem with Binance is not just that they still continue working on both sides, it's that they showed cooperation with the Russian government before the war, and as far as I know, they still continue cooperating with the Russian government,"" Chobanian said. Binance, the biggest crypto exchange worldwide by volume,  told  CoinDesk in February it had no plans to unilaterally ban Russian users from the platform, but that it would take actions against those who have had sanctions levied against them. Jessica Jung, a Binance spokesperson, said, ""We prefer not to comment on false accusations. Our focus is on helping people."" She also quoted from a press release announcing Binance's $10 million donation and the launch of a crowdfunding site called the Ukraine Emergency Relief Fund. Chobanian offered no proof that Binance is actively working with the Russian government, but the Russian market has long been an important one for Binance. In 2019, Zhao  called  Russia ""our key market,"" and that ""we are always looking for partners in any community, especially in Russia."" In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Zhao  said  financial sanctions are not a ""crypto-specific issue,"" and that blocking all Russians from the crypto exchange would be ""unethical."" On the other hand, Russian authorities have sent mixed signals about crypto, with the central bank advocating a  ban  but the government proposing to  regulate it instead . Chobanian, who is also the president of the Blockchain Association of Ukraine, appeared before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs on Thursday for a hearing on ""The Role of Digital Assets in Illicit Finance."" During that hearing, he accused Binance of not taking an aggressive enough stance against the Russian government. ""The first thing we did as a crypto community in Ukraine was to shut down all ruble operations because that was a big hole in the sanctions list. … Unfortunately, not all crypto companies followed our lead, mainly Binance,"" he said during the  hearing . He added that crypto may be a useful lifeline for Russians who oppose the war and are trying to leave their country. ""The only way for them to exist outside of Russia right now is crypto, probably. Obviously, not being able to buy a house or a car, but at least you can survive,"" he said. Chobanian also said Binance has yet to make the $10 million donation it promised in a  statement  in February. Binance said then it would send the money to Ukrainian intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) for humanitarian relief. ""They said that they donated $10 million to the Ukrainian government. Well, I haven't seen that $10 million. No one knows where that went,"" he said. In a blog post, Binance cites specific NGOs to which it says it donated. According to transaction details on its  website , Binance has so far donated $2.5 million worth of Binance USD (BUSD) and $401,566 worth of Binance coin (BNB).

binance, News , Binance launches Binance Bridge 2.0 to integrate CeFi and DeFi  ,"On Tuesday, centralized cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced the rollout of Binance Bridge 2.0. The feature enables users to bridge assets from any blockchain, including tokens not listed on the Binance app, to the BNB Chain. Bridged tokens listed on Binance will be stored in the Funding or Spot Wallet, while unlisted bridged tokens will be transferred to the Funding Wallet only. Users can bridge-in or bridge-out tokens between their native blockchains and BNB Chain via regular deposit and withdrawal functions. In the future, Binance also plans to create a better version of its mobile app to allow users to facilitate such conversion via a single click. Regarding the development, Mayur Kamat, head of product at Binance, said: ""With Binance Bridge 2.0, we can make decentralized finance accessible to a larger audience worldwide while still providing the seamless user experience that centralized finance offers. We are already seeing this via the tremendous adoption of the PancakeSwap Mini-app."" Binance has also implemented a brand new automated token circulation control system in Binance Bridge 2.0. The exchange will not maintain a surplus of pegged tokens, also  known as wrapped assets , except for a buffer size in hot wallets. Instead, it will print additional tokens when users withdraw pegged tokens onto the BNB Smart Chain. The company indicated that all other circulation will be backed by the native tokens deposited by the users from the original blockchains. When users want to switch from the pegged tokens back to the original tokens, they can deposit the pegged tokens into Binance and withdraw the original tokens. Simultaneously, the excessive tokens will be swept to the cold wallet and burnt automatically.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/binance-launches-binance-bridge-2-0-to-integrate-cefi-and-defi,cointelegraph,2022-03-29,00:00:00,en,275,1744,5.341818181818182,101,0.36727272727272725,centralized cryptocurrency exchange binance announced rollout binance feature enables user asset blockchain including token listed binance app bnb chain bridged token listed binance stored funding spot wallet unlisted bridged token transferred funding wallet user token native blockchains bnb chain regular deposit withdrawal function future binance plan create version mobile app user facilitate conversion single development mayur kamat product binance binance make decentralized finance accessible larger audience worldwide providing seamless user experience centralized finance offer tremendous adoption pancakeswap mini app binance implemented automated token circulation control system binance exchange maintain surplus pegged token wrapped asset buffer size hot wallet print additional token user withdraw pegged token bnb chain company circulation backed native token deposited user original blockchains user switch pegged token original token deposit pegged token binance withdraw original token simultaneously excessive token swept cold wallet burnt automatically,0.09706959706959707,positive,0.5762468300929839,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.888, 'pos': 0.112, 'compound': 0.9042}",0.9042,0.0,0.888,0.112,positive,0.33333322222225925,0.023255813773210746,positive
binance,News Analysis,The Growing Digital Asset Lifeline in Ukraine,"As Russia’s invasion of Ukraine continues, digital assets have played an important role in international support for Ukraine’s defenses and humanitarian efforts. In an outraged response to the war, people from around the world are pouring assets into Ukraine –  at least $100 million , as of earlier this month – using the alternative financial system built around cryptocurrencies. This article originally appeared in  Crypto for Advisors , CoinDesk’s weekly newsletter defining crypto, digital assets and the future of finance.  Sign up here  to get it in your inbox every Thursday. “There are a couple of things going on here: One is that crypto enables you to move assets person to person without intermediaries, which is a virtue when you are in a conflict zone and access to financial intermediaries is unreliable at best,” said Alex Tapscott, managing director of alternative investment manager Ninepoint Partners and co-author of “ Blockchain Revolution .” “In Ukraine, not only are charities raising money, but other civil and societal organizations are raising money as well, including the government.” The  decentralized autonomous organization  (DAO)  UkraineDAO  has raised over $7 million in direct crypto payments for nonprofit organizations in the country, supported by the sale of  Ukrainian flag non-fungible tokens (NFT)  and promoted by Russian art collective  Pussy Riot , in addition to a number of fintech and crypto concerns. A number of  organizations  and individuals, including  Ukrainian boxer Wladimir Klitschko , are also raising and sending money to benefit the work of organizations like the Red Cross within Ukraine, at times involving digital assets in their giving. Big giving Digital assets have also enabled millions of dollars to be transmitted directly to these organizations, to civilians on the ground in Ukraine and to the Ukrainian government and military, said Tapscott, as  Ukrainians were cut off from some charity and crowdfunding campaigns . “At least one of the big charities in Ukraine that was using crowdfunding platforms found itself cut off,” said Tapscott. “The concern was that they were violating the platform’s terms of service, which didn’t allow you to raise money to buy weaponry.” Individuals, organizations and countries have had major security and logistical issues sending cash into conflict zones, said Tapscott. Notoriously, in 2007, the  U.S. sent $12 billion to Iraq , including billions of dollars of shrink-wrapped cash on pallets, only to have much of it go unaccounted for. But cryptocurrency transactions are irrevocable, and for the most part transparent. So not only can cryptocurrency get to where the donor wants it to go but the donor has evidence that it went into the right hands –and crypto is allowing donors to give more directly than they have in the past. Many of the suppliers to the Ukrainian military prefer to be paid in crypto, said John Sarson, the CEO of Sarson Funds, a crypto asset manager. “With the ability to donate cryptocurrency, never before have you been able to see donations make such a difference,” said Sarson. “Generals in Ukraine say that 40% of their suppliers are now accepting cryptocurrency directly. For those that don’t, Ukraine can just sell crypto into cash and then pay cash. Ukraine  passed legislation in recent weeks to legalize crypto  because they are getting a giant net benefit out of it.” Tapscott said the donations are coming from all over the world using different kinds of tokens and assets, ranging from a few dollars to hundreds of thousands of dollars. Notably, Polkadot ecosystem co-founder Gavin Wood  sent over $5 million worth  of his DOT tokens to support Ukraine’s defense. “There are remarkable people just looking for ways to make a difference,” Tapscott said. “For 30 years we’ve had this internet of information, an amazing tool for communication and sharing but not so good for moving and sharing money. A decade ago, in this kind of situation, what could someone do? Donate to the Red Cross, or post something on social media showing their support for whatever side they wanted to support; now you can put ammunition in the hands of people fighting for their freedom.” Crypto in Russia On the other side of the conflict, Russia’s population of more than 145 million is now  cut off from the global financial system  and the global economy, said Tapscott, and cryptocurrencies might be a refuge for Russian citizens amid international sanctions. “It’s not the fault of the people that they live in a country where the government devalued their own currency; here you have a situation in Russia where many people don’t care for this war and it isn’t fair to them that their bank accounts are frozen and the ruble isn’t worth anything,” said  Adam Blumberg , co-founder of  PlannerDAO , an educational provider for financial advisors in the digital assets space. In recent weeks, banks and payments companies have frozen, suspended or completely discontinued their business in Russia. In some cases, the exits have been devastating for the Russian people – according to Tapscott, Visa (V) and Mastercard (MA) alone account for 70% of transactions in Russia, and  both companies have suspended operations  in the country. While banks and other traditional financial institutions flee Russia amid sanctions, many  crypto companies are staying put . Binance, for example, deemed calls to freeze Russian accounts as “overreach,” and Kraken has also resisted calls for a blanket suspension on all Russian users. Others, like MetaMask and Coinbase (COIN), have temporarily frozen Russian accounts. “So far most crypto companies have resisted the mass exodus from Russia, though they are suspending the accounts of people suspected of criminal activity and freezing the accounts of sanctioned individuals, but they’re not suspending the ability of typical Russians who are not criminals from using their services,” Tapscott said. “Businesses usually operate the way they think the world should work, and the crypto industry generally has this belief that it’s bad behavior to just cut people off when there’s no requirement that they do so.” Because crypto transactions are irrevocable, they have some attraction to Russians seeking to circumvent sanctions, but because they are transparent the international community will likely know who is sending money and where that money is going. Experts have noted that crypto is  unlikely to be a workaround  for  sanctions evasion . Most crypto firms seem to be  taking a targeted approach , freezing the accounts of individuals who are being sanctioned but allowing assets to continue to flow. Russians are increasingly turning to digital assets to make payments, save and make payroll, Tapscott said, as the  value of the ruble  has cratered. Crypto’s evolving role As the world becomes more unstable, there’s a growing role for digital assets as a hedge against geopolitical risk and as a lifeline for people whose access to the global financial system has been removed or restricted, Tapscott said. “There’s a  Lenin  quote, ‘There are some weeks where decades happen,’” he said. “I believe that was meant to refer to political change, but I think it also applies to an acceleration in the  adoption of crypto assets . We’re seeing clear signs that this conflict is accelerating the adoption and use of crypto. The fact that American and European officials have weaponized fiat currencies to penalize Russia acts in the long term as a tailwind as well for anything you can self-custody and is not tied to a government or a corporation.”",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/03/31/the-growing-digital-asset-lifeline-in-ukraine/,coindesk,2022-03-31,12:50:00,en,1226,7618,5.185154975530179,509,0.41517128874388254,russia invasion ukraine continues digital asset played important role international support ukraine defense humanitarian effort outraged response war people world pouring asset ukraine earlier alternative financial system built cryptocurrencies article originally appeared crypto advisor coindesk newsletter defining crypto digital asset future finance sign inbox couple thing crypto enables move asset intermediary virtue conflict zone access financial intermediary unreliable tapscott managing director alternative investment manager ninepoint partner author blockchain revolution ukraine charity raising civil societal organization raising including government decentralized autonomous organization dao ukrainedao raised direct crypto payment nonprofit organization country supported ukrainian flag fungible token nft promoted russian collective pussy riot addition number fintech crypto concern number organization individual including ukrainian boxer wladimir klitschko raising sending benefit work organization ukraine time involving digital asset giving big giving digital asset enabled million dollar transmitted directly organization civilian ground ukraine ukrainian government military tapscott ukrainian cut crowdfunding campaign big charity ukraine crowdfunding platform found cut tapscott concern violating platform term service raise buy weaponry individual organization country security logistical issue sending conflict zone tapscott notoriously iraq including billion dollar shrink wrapped pallet unaccounted cryptocurrency transaction irrevocable part transparent cryptocurrency donor donor evidence hand crypto allowing donor give directly past supplier ukrainian military prefer paid crypto sarson ceo sarson fund crypto asset manager ability donate cryptocurrency donation make difference sarson general ukraine supplier accepting cryptocurrency directly ukraine crypto pay ukraine passed legislation recent legalize crypto giant net benefit tapscott donation coming world kind token asset ranging dollar hundred thousand dollar notably polkadot ecosystem founder token support ukraine defense remarkable people way make difference tapscott year internet information amazing tool communication sharing moving sharing decade ago kind situation donate social medium showing support side wanted support put ammunition hand people fighting freedom crypto russia side conflict russia population cut global financial system global economy tapscott cryptocurrencies refuge russian citizen amid international sanction fault people live country government devalued currency situation russia people care war bank account frozen blumberg founder plannerdao educational provider financial advisor digital asset space recent payment company frozen suspended completely discontinued business russia case exit devastating russian people tapscott visa mastercard account transaction russia company suspended operation country traditional financial institution flee russia amid sanction crypto company staying put binance deemed call freeze russian account overreach kraken resisted call blanket suspension russian user metamask coinbase coin temporarily frozen russian account crypto company resisted mass exodus russia suspending account people suspected criminal activity freezing account sanctioned individual suspending ability typical russian criminal service tapscott business operate world work crypto industry generally belief bad behavior cut people requirement crypto transaction irrevocable attraction russian seeking circumvent sanction transparent international community sending expert noted crypto workaround sanction evasion crypto firm taking targeted approach freezing account individual sanctioned allowing asset continue flow russian increasingly turning digital asset make payment save make payroll tapscott cratered crypto evolving role world unstable growing role digital asset geopolitical risk lifeline people access global financial system removed restricted tapscott lenin quote decade happen meant refer political change applies acceleration adoption crypto asset clear sign conflict accelerating adoption crypto fact american european official weaponized fiat currency penalize russia act term tailwind custody tied government corporation,0.01427819865319866,positive,0.27905092592592595,"{'neg': 0.118, 'neu': 0.679, 'pos': 0.203, 'compound': 0.9932}",0.9932,0.118,0.679,0.203,positive,-0.5999999850000004,0.08583690968704526,negative
binance,Business,Former Binance CFO Wei Zhou Buys Coins.ph: Report,"Former Binance Chief Financial Officer Wei Zhou bought  Coins.ph , a mobile wallet and digital currency exchange, from Gojek,  according to a report  in India-based publication The Ken on Monday. In January 2019, Indonesian technology company Gojek bought  Coins.ph  for  $95 million . According to the report, Gojek sold it for at least double that amount to Zhou. Several regional investors familiar with either  Coins.ph  or Gojek confirmed the deal to The Ken, it reported. Zhou could steer the Manila, Philippines-based company back to its crypto roots. Coins.ph  was founded in 2014 and was one of the earliest crypto wallets and exchanges in the Philippines. It later pivoted to providing broader financial services. “Gojek didn’t do much with it, which was unfortunate because Coins was the leading crypto wallet in the Philippines,” a senior investment executive familiar with the company told The Ken. “But now, with the new management, they’ll revive that part of the business as a crypto wallet and trading platform, making it the Coinbase of Southeast Asia.” Zhou  left  Binance last May for personal reasons. At the time, the company declined to comment on his whereabouts. He hasn't updated his  experience  on LinkedIn since then, and so this report is the first sign of his possible re-emergence into the crypto scene. He had worked for Binance for three years.

binance, News ," Gulf Energy pursues joint venture with Binance, invests in BNB  ","Thailand-based Gulf Energy has made strategic investments in cryptocurrency exchange Binance US and signaled its pursuit of a joint venture with the global Binance exchange as part of a targeted effort to gain exposure to the digital asset market.  Gulf Energy  disclosed  in a regulatory filing on April 18 that it invested in “Series Seed Preferred Stock issued by BAM Trading Services Inc.,” which is the operator of Binance US. The investment in Binance US gives Gulf Energy exposure to “one of the fastest user scale-up exchanges in the world” well ahead of the exchange’s planned initial public offering, the company said.  Changpeng Zhao, who runs Binance’s global cryptocurrency exchange, confirmed in July 2021 that Binance US was  exploring pathways for a public offering .  In a separate filing on Monday, Gulf Energy  disclosed  that it is pursuing a “joint venture” with Binance to operate a cryptocurrency exchange in Thailand. Once the joint venture is established, the newly formed entity will apply for digital asset licenses with the appropriate authorities. Gulf Energy’s filing also disclosed investments in Binance Coin ( BNB ), which is the native crypto asset of the Binance ecosystem.  The  collaboration between Gulf Energy and Binance  has been in the making for several months now as the cryptocurrency exchange sought to re-establish operations in the Southeast Asian country. In July 2021, Thailand’s securities regulator accused Binance of  operating a digital asset business illegally  in the country. Binance was the  subject of regulatory scrutiny  from several other jurisdictions as well, including Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, the Cayman Islands and the Canadian province of Ontario.

binance,Markets,BNB Chain Burns Over $770M Worth of BNB Tokens,"BNB Chain will burn over 1.8 million binance coins (BNB) in its first burn this quarter,  data from trackers  shows. The burn was executed on BNB Chain at 08:23:05 UTC on Tuesday via the ""bnb1ultyhpw2p2ktvr68swz56570lgj2rdsadq3ym2"" tied to crypto exchange Binance,  data shows . “$741,840,738 worth of #BNB will be taken out of circulation soon,” Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao  confirmed in a tweet . The burn would be conducted at an average price of $403 per BNB, the data shows. BNB powers the BNB Chain ecosystem and is the native coin of the BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain. It was issued by crypto exchange Binance after an initial coin offering in 2017. BNB uses an auto-burn system to reduce its total supply to 100,000,000 BNB. The auto-burn mechanism adjusts the amount of BNB to be burned based on BNB's price and the number of blocks generated on the BNB Smart Chain (BSC) during the quarter. Meanwhile, data shows an estimated 1.8 million BNB are on track to be burned next quarter, expected sometime in August. BNB trades at $419 at writing time and is up 4.9% in the past 24 hours.

binance,Business,"Binance.US Quits Blockchain Association, Forms In-House Lobbying Shop","Binance.US , the American arm of the world’s largest crypto exchange by trading volume, is leaving noted crypto lobbying group Blockchain Association after less than two years due to a difference in “values, goals and standards,” a person close to the company told CoinDesk. “Binance.US made a major investment last year in the Blockchain Association,” said the person. “Our executives recently negotiated in good faith with Blockchain Association executives in an effort to grow Binance.US’ role within the group. But after multiple conversations we ultimately determined that our values, goals and standards were not fully aligned.” “The resources that we would have dedicated will now be reallocated to efforts consistent with  Binance.US ’ policy agenda in Washington and state capitals across the country,” the person continued. A Blockchain Association spokesperson confirmed the departure after the initial publication of this article. “The Blockchain Association wishes  Binance.US  the best of luck as they build out their operation in Washington,” spokesperson Curtis Kincaid said via email. He said the organization currently has a membership of “more than 80 of the American crypto economy’s most prominent firms, investors, exchanges, infrastructure companies, and projects.” Binance.US joined the lobbying group in August 2020.

binance, News , Binance embarrassed after unveiling swastika-like emoji on Hitler’s birthday  ,"Binance, the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, released a new Binance Emoji on Twitter that users noticed bore a striking resemblance to a swastika.  On Wednesday morning, Binance CEO, Changpeng “CZ” Zhao retweeted Binance’s original post, adding “#binance” to show off the new emoji.  The original posts, which have since been deleted, were quick to do the rounds on Twitter in the form of screenshots, where users immediately began criticizing the resemblance.  The new Binance emoji is a literal swastika  pic.twitter.com/lCOuWuPnyF — mann0000.eth  (@nftshare)  April 20, 2022 
 
 Smaller Twitter account Nftshare posted about it to their 300 followers, which gained more than 6,000 likes and hundreds of retweets, saying that “The new Binance emoji is a literal swastika,” while other large accounts on Crypto Twitter  rushed  to make  jokes  about Binance’s gaffe.  Compounding the mistake, users also  pointed  out the fact that April 20 also happened to be Hitler’s birthday. Most didn’t assume that Binance was making an intentional reference to the Nazi party nor did they assume the error was a result of celebrating cannabis day 4/20 a little too enthusiastically.  After initially deleting the tweets from its own and CZ’s Twitter pages, Binance backpedaled by taking the emoji down and making a public apology nearly eight hours after the incident first went viral.  Binance  told  its 8.4 million followers that the error was obviously really embarrassing. “We’re not sure how that emoji got through several layers of review without anyone noticing, but we immediately flagged the issue, pulled it down, and the new emoji design is being rolled out as we speak.” If I was the worlds largest cryptocurrency exchange, I would just not make my logo a swatiska on Hitler’s birthday — Bennett Tomlin (@BennettTomlin)  April 20, 2022 
 
 While being quite blunt in his criticism of Binance, crypto-critic Bennett Tomlin tempered his attack by  saying  that the people working on the logo may not have had the cultural knowledge to understand how it could have been misinterpreted.

binance,Policy,Binance Asks to Be Removed From Crypto Romance Scam Lawsuit,"Binance on Thursday asked a federal judge in Texas to be removed from an $8 million lawsuit claiming the crypto exchange “aided and abetted” a romance scam. Plaintiff Divya Gadasalli is suing the Cayman Islands company in the federal civil court over Binance's alleged role in the scheme, which she said involved cashing out crypto she had bought on Coinbase (COIN). Gadasalli is also suing TD Bank, Abacus Federal Savings Bank and the Poloniex crypto exchange, among others. Law360 first reported the  news . In its motion to dismiss, Binance told the court that Gadasalli based her allegations on paper-thin assertions and failed to establish a claim. In addition, the exchange said it does not do business in the United States, and as a foreign entity it is not subject to the “personal jurisdiction” of the U.S. federal court system.

binance,Policy,Binance Seeking ‘Ideal Point’ for India Launch,"Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, is actively trying to ""find the ideal point for launching its local presence in India,"" a Binance spokesperson told CoinDesk in an email. ""We are monitoring the changes in the local regulatory environment ... We are also in talks with different stakeholders to understand the market approach of the South Asia market in a compliant manner,"" the spokesperson added. CoinDesk had posed the India question to Binance after multiple sources had indicated the company's hiring interest in the region. A check of LinkedIn shows Binance actively seeking to fill these roles in India and South Asia:  Head of Government  Relations  APAC,  Regulatory Counsel APAC ,  Head of Acquisition ,  Executive Communications and Visibility Lead ,  Communications and PR Lead ,  PR Director APAC ,  Global Comms/PR manager  and a  Content Marketing Specialist . Binance coming to India – a nation of 1.4 billion with more than 50% of the populace under the age of 30 – despite regulatory pressures such as the  new tax law  and the  stifling of payment solutions  – could be a major event for the crypto ecosystem. ""Certainly user awareness and crypto adoption may receive a boost but it could backfire because Binance would have to disclose [know-your-customer information] of Indian retailers who may have used an Indian exchange to trade money on [the exchange],"" said Siddharth Sogani, founder and CEO of crypto research firm Crebaco. The development comes after Coinbase (COIN), the world's third-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume, launched operations in India on April 7, only to  exit three days later  thanks to  regulatory snags  that  disrupted  nearly the entire industry.

Asked about its India vision in the near future, particularly after the struggles for Coinbase and FTX, the Binance spokesperson said India can be a major crypto participant. ""More than 10 crore (100 million) Indians own cryptocurrency according to industry reports, and we can tell that mass adoption of crypto is happening in India. With strong industry players on [the] ground, making investments in the country's industry, India can become one of the hubs for crypto industry,"" the spokesperson said. According to policy specialists in India, neither Binance nor FTX are likely to come to India until the regulatory environment improves, particularly after Coinbase's troubled launch. Vivan Sharan, a technology and policy expert who has worked with the government in the past, said global crypto exchanges could be great for India. ""India [must not] view investments from global crypto-exchanges as a disruptive force,"" said Sharan. ""Rather, it should consider them an economic opportunity that can be harnessed through regulation.

binance,Policy,Biden Administration Wants Crypto Exchanges to Separate Customer and Corporate Funds,"U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration will press Congress to demand cryptocurrency exchanges keep their customers’ money separate from their own corporate funds, according to a person familiar with the plan that could constrain the way the industry does business. Spurred by Coinbase’s (COIN) recent  disclosure  that customers’ money would be jammed up if the company declared bankruptcy, federal officials intend to push U.S. lawmakers to fix the problem by insisting that a future legal framework require crypto firms keep customer assets walled off. That type of custodial rule is  standard  for financial firms such as futures platforms, but crypto exchanges routinely mingle their funds with customers’ holdings in the same pot – a situation the administration wants to see ended by legislation. The securities industry commonly commingles funds, but the investments are also more heavily regulated. Federal officials will push in the coming weeks to put the change into any crypto bill considered by Congress, the person said, building on a contention last year in the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets report on  stablecoins : Companies that host  crypto wallets  need close federal oversight. The administration thinks the trading platforms should still permit pooling of customers’ assets, allowing the companies to keep managing trades internally rather than having to put each move on a blockchain. Coinbase, a publicly traded company that is one of the industry’s largest exchanges, admitted in a filing to the Securities and Exchange Commission last week that “in the event of a bankruptcy, the crypto assets we hold in custody on behalf of our customers could be subject to bankruptcy proceedings and such customers could be treated as our general unsecured creditors.” That’s the bottom rung of people paid back when a company fails, suggesting a misstep by Coinbase could indefinitely lock up clients’ tokens – or funnel them away to pay other creditors. ""Don't think you actually own your tokens when you go into a digital wallet,"" Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler said at a conference this week, underlining some of the federal government’s concerns about custody of investors’ assets. ""If the platform goes down, guess what, you just have a counterparty relationship with the platform. Get in line in bankruptcy courts."" When a firm takes a customer’s tokens, they can use them as they will, Gensler pointed out. In fact, the exchanges are “often trading against you,” he said. And since customers  lost billions  in the wreckage of Luna’s algorithmic stablecoin, terraUSD (UST), his investor-protection advocacy could gain momentum. “Congressional Democrats will follow his lead and escalate their calls for greater oversight,” predicted Jaret Seiberg, a Washington-based analyst at Cowen Group, Inc., in a research note this week. “The troubles with TerraUSD and the drop in crypto valuations will make it politically more challenging for Republicans to effectively oppose Gensler's policy agenda.” For its part, Coinbase – staggered by a loss of more than 80% in its share price since last year – assured its nervous customers and investors that the distressing splash of its SEC filing wasn’t meant to signal anything about its prospects. Founder and CEO Brian Armstrong  said  that the disclosures were merely responding to a new SEC  requirement , and his company isn’t in danger of filing for bankruptcy protection. For now, crypto’s leading platforms – also including names such as  Binance.US , FTX and Kraken – don’t need to strain themselves to meet the administration’s push for a custody rule. A closely divided and essentially immobile Congress isn’t likely to produce legislation this year, especially as lawmakers gear up for the bloody arena of the midterm elections in November. The most optimistic guesses see a crypto bill getting traction when the dust settles on the new Congress next year. But not everybody sees fencing off customers’ money as the best answer. “Instead of focusing on the lack of client asset segregation at digital asset exchanges, which is also true with securities held in ‘ street name ’ at  DTCC , legislators should work on a Digital Asset Investor Protection Act that mirrors the Securities Investor Protection Act,” said Dave Weisberger, co-founder and CEO of CoinRoutes, Inc. It could give investors “primary status in bankruptcy proceedings,” and it could also set up a backstop fund to cover losses like the one securities investors have. For others, a law banning firms from blending customers’ assets with their own would still represent a bare minimum for those calling for rigorous investor safeguards. ""There is a lot more that has to be done,"" said Patrick McCarty, a financial consultant and former regulator who teaches crypto classes at Georgetown Law. He said segregated accounts would be ""a significant step forward"" but argued strict regulations and a deeper overhaul of the business model are needed to return to crypto's founding ideas about recording every transaction on an indelible public ledger. ""Why would one advocate for a band aid – albeit significant – when it looks like major surgery is needed to protect investors?"" McCarty said.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/05/18/biden-administration-wants-crypto-exchanges-to-separate-customer-and-corporate-funds/,coindesk,2022-05-18,19:25:00,en,834,5272,5.305755395683454,302,0.36211031175059955,president biden administration press congress demand cryptocurrency exchange customer separate corporate fund familiar plan constrain industry business spurred coinbase coin recent disclosure customer jammed company declared bankruptcy federal official intend push lawmaker problem insisting future legal framework require crypto firm customer asset walled type custodial standard financial firm future platform crypto exchange routinely mingle fund customer holding pot situation administration ended legislation security industry commonly commingles fund investment heavily regulated federal official push coming put change crypto considered congress building contention president working group financial market report stablecoins company host crypto wallet federal oversight administration think trading platform permit pooling customer asset allowing company managing trade internally put move blockchain coinbase publicly traded company industry largest exchange admitted filing security exchange commission event bankruptcy crypto asset hold custody behalf customer subject bankruptcy proceeding customer treated general unsecured creditor bottom rung people paid company fails suggesting misstep coinbase indefinitely client token funnel pay creditor token digital wallet security exchange commission sec chair gensler conference underlining federal government concern custody investor asset platform counterparty relationship platform line bankruptcy court firm take customer token gensler pointed fact exchange trading customer lost billion wreckage algorithmic stablecoin terrausd ust investor protection advocacy gain momentum congressional democrat follow lead escalate call greater oversight predicted jaret seiberg based analyst group research note trouble terrausd drop crypto valuation make politically challenging republican effectively oppose gensler policy agenda part coinbase staggered loss share assured nervous customer investor distressing splash sec filing meant signal prospect founder ceo disclosure responding sec requirement company danger filing bankruptcy protection crypto leading platform including name binance ftx kraken meet administration push custody closely divided essentially immobile congress produce legislation lawmaker gear bloody midterm election optimistic guess crypto traction dust congress see fencing customer answer focusing lack client asset segregation digital asset exchange security dtcc legislator work digital asset investor protection act mirror security investor protection act weisberger founder ceo coinroutes give investor primary status bankruptcy proceeding set backstop fund loss security investor banning firm blending customer asset represent minimum calling rigorous investor safeguard lot financial consultant regulator teach crypto class georgetown segregated account significant step forward argued strict regulation deeper overhaul business model needed return crypto founding idea recording transaction indelible public ledger advocate band aid albeit significant surgery needed protect investor,0.0002192982456140343,positive,0.35307017543859653,"{'neg': 0.098, 'neu': 0.751, 'pos': 0.152, 'compound': 0.9633}",0.9633,0.098,0.751,0.152,positive,-0.6363636170798904,0.09141274212905058,negative
binance, Altcoin Watch , Here’s why Terra’s snowball effect could send Avalanche (AVAX) price to $15 ,"Avalanche ( AVAX ) has emerged as one of the worst-performing cryptocurrencies among the top-ranking tokens in the last 24 hours, partially due to fears connected to Terra ( LUNA ) and it's a near-dead UST algorithmic stablecoin project. Avalanche price dips amid Terra's tax evasion FUD AVAX's price plunged by nearly 14% between May 18, where it traded near $35 to May 19 when the price dipped to $28.50. The dip  coincided  with a South Korean news agency report that claims Terraforms Labs, the developer of the Terra blockchain, owes 100 billion won (approximately $78.5 million) to the regional tax agency. #Terra  owes $78.5M in taxes to South Korea's government — Market Rebellion (@MarketRebels)  May 18, 2022 
 
 The news came three days after Luna Foundation Guard (LFG), a nonprofit subsidiary of TerraForms,  revealed  that it had around 1.97 million AVAX tokens (worth $58.39 million at May 19's price) in the reserves that were supposed to back its benchmark UST stablecoin.  In the same pool, LFG also holds Bitcoin ( BTC ), Binance Coin ( BNB ) and LUNA. The firm had earlier sold a good portion of its holdings to shore up UST's value following its "" depeg "" from the U.S. dollar. Interestingly, LFG has not sold any AVAX, nonetheless, the panic around the Terra fiasco prompted the  Avalanche token to plunge by nearly 50%  month-to-date, including a 30% intraday decline on May 11.

Source: TradingView From a technical perspective, AVAX's price could fall by another 40% in May as it breaks out of its prevailing bearish continuation setup. Dubbed ""bear pennant,"" the pattern appears when the price consolidates inside a range—defined by a falling upper trendline and a rising lower trendline—after a strong move downward. It resolves after the price breaks below the lower trendline and, as a rule of technical analysis, falls by as much as the flagpole of the previous downtrend. The bear pennant setup puts AVAX en route to around $17 in May, down about 40% from May 19's price.

binance, Markets News , Top 3 cryptocurrencies that are faring the best in the 2022 bear market  ,"The crypto market has been in decline over the past six months with its valuation dropping from over $3 trillion in November 2021 to $1.23 trillion in May 2022. Fears over persistently higher inflation, the  Federal Reserve's hawkish response  to it, and the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia prompted investors to limit their exposure to riskier assets. Also, their  increasing appetite for the safe-havens , such as the U.S. dollar, weighed down demand for some of the top cryptocurrencies and U.S. equities. As a result, some digital assets, such as Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Cardano ( ADA ), fell by more than 80% from their record highs established last year. At the same time, a few tokens witnessed similar albeit dwarfed declines compared to other assets in the top-30.  These are three among those cryptocurrencies listed in random order. Monero (-65%) Privacy-focused cryptocurrency Monero ( XMR ) has suffered fewer losses than its top rivals in the space since November 2021. XMR's price dropped nearly 40% to $186 from its November 2021 peak of around $300. The plunge surfaced as a part of a broader correction move that started after Monero reached its record high in May 2021, near $520, bringing its net downside retracement to around 65%. XMR/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView XMR's limited downside prospects since November 2021 came forth amid reports that  it's been used to bypass sanctions . Meanwhile, fears of strict regulations lurking over the crypto market also appeared to have  boosted the speculative demand  for Monero. From a technical perspective, XMR has been consolidating in a range defined by its 50-week exponential moving average (50-week EMA; the red wave) around $211 and 200-week EMA (the blue wave) near $167, underscoring a bias conflict. UNUS SED LEO (-40%) UNUS SED LEO ( LEO ), a utility token backed by iFinex — the parent company of BitFinex exchange, has been largely unfazed by broader crypto trends.  The token continued its uptrend even as its rivals in the top-30 moved lower after November 2021; it  reached an all-time high  of around $8.15 in February 2022 but has since corrected by almost 40%, now trading at around $4.90. LEO/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView Notably, iFinex  introduced  LEO in a private token sale to raise $1 billion back in 2018. In doing so, the firm wanted to alleviate the cash shortfall it had incurred after the  partial fund seizure  of its payment processor, Crypto Capital. IFinex also announced that it would buy back LEO with a minimum of 27% of its consolidated revenues from the previous month, thus removing its supply from the market. In addition, the firm also committed to allocating 95% of the recovered Crypto Capital funds and 80% of the funds from the BitFinex hack in 2016 to buy LEO. LEO's returns to date now stand around 100%. But the token appears heavily centralized, with a so-called centralized exchange whale still holding around 97% of its net supply,  according  to data from Santiment. Binance Coin (-53%) Like Monero,  BNB  topped out in early May as its price per token crossed over $700. Then in November 2021, the BNB/USD pair almost retested its record high before correcting lower with the rest of the market. In doing so, it wiped out more than half of its valuation, now trading around $325. BNB/USD weekly price chart. Source: TradingView BNB serves as a utility token inside the Binance ecosystem, including the world's leading crypto exchange by volume and a native blockchain named  BNB Chain . The token holders also get to submit proposals via BNB Chain's built-in governance module, which are then voted on. Other crypto assets Top cryptos, Bitcoin ( BTC ), and  Ethereum's native token , Ether ( ETH ), have also fared better than most of their top-ranking rivals in the ongoing bear market.  BTC's price has dropped by 57% to around $29,300 from its November 2021 record high of $69,000. Meanwhile, the second-largest crypto, ETH, has plunged 60% to around $1,975 from above $4,850 in the same period.

binance, News , Coinbase offers ‘thousands of tokens’ in expanded swap service ,"America’s largest crypto exchange Coinbase has added the BNB Chain, formerly Binance Smart Chain, and Avalanche to the Coinbase Wallet’s list of supported networks where users can swap and store cryptocurrencies. The Tuesday blog post from the exchange  boasts  that the added functionality will provide access to “thousands of tokens,” which constitute a “greater variety than most traditional centralized exchanges can offer.” One Wallet. Even more networks. Thousands of tokens. Now supporting token swaps on  @avalancheavax  and  @BNBCHAIN  on Coinbase Wallet. Learn more ->  https://t.co/ZdEg1T8s53   pic.twitter.com/prWhSlPYl8 — Coinbase Wallet (@CoinbaseWallet)  May 23, 2022 
 
 The added functionality to BNB Chain and Avalanche brings the total supported networks up to four, including Ethereum and Polygon. Users of the wallet who wish to trade on-chain can use Coinbase’s own in-app  decentralized exchange  (DEX) on four networks. Token bridging is not yet available. Coinbase Wallet allows users to self-custody their crypto and provides access to on-chain as opposed to the features available on Coinbase’s centralized platform. Coinbase currently has only 173 tokens listed on its exchange. These numbers pale in comparison to the thousands available across the four networks Coinbase Wallet users now have access to. The exchange stated that in the coming months, “we’ll be making it possible to conduct swaps on an even greater variety of networks:” “Not only will trading expand, but we’re also planning to add support for network bridging, allowing you to seamlessly move tokens across multiple networks.” Network bridging involves sending tokens between networks without passing through a centralized exchange (CEX). Popular token bridges include Multichain and Wormhole. Although only available for a small number of users at first, Coinbase is also  rolling out its Web3 wallet  and browser for the mobile app. This will give mobile traders access to the wide ecosystem of DEXs on supported networks beyond just Coinbase’s own.

binance,Opinion,Crypto Can Overcome Its Reputation as a Weak Link in Financial Crime. Here's How,"The crypto sector is often painted as the weakest link in the fight against financial crime. More recently, it has been accused of posing a risk to financial stability and compromising investor security with its laissez-faire attitude toward cybersecurity. But if you take the temperature of illicit activity linked to the crypto-asset ecosphere, it throws up some sharp contradictions. It is true that crypto remains the payment mechanism of choice for narcotics and other illicit commodities on the darknet, but as law enforcement continues to reinforce its surveillance of these hawkers, such black markets are declining. Unregulated crypto-asset exchanges continue to serve as means for state actors to circumvent barriers in the formal financial system. U.S. courts have just unsealed a memorandum opinion outlining the alleged role of a crypto-asset exchange in the processing of some $10 million in payments barred under international sanctions. But the growth in crypto-asset forensic technology is now making it increasingly difficult to cash out criminal funds. Ten million is minute compared with the  recovered  $3.6 billion linked to the Bitfinex hack. There are other established, less complex methods for laundering criminal funds at scale. Read More:  How Not to Run a Cryptocurrency Exchange Crypto assets get a bad rap, sometimes rightly but often not. Over recent months, the sector has enhanced its reputation by enabling and supporting efforts to raise funds for Ukraine to procure nonlethal equipment and humanitarian aid – as well as for Afghanistan despite that the war-torn country’s formal financial sector has come to an effective standstill. Safeguarding wealth In developing nations, more people are using crypto assets to keep their wealth safe from governmental restrictions and unlawful appropriation.  Web 3  components, such as non-fungible tokens ( NFTs ), offer the prospect of supporting marginalized groups – including the victims of online sexual exploitation – by the application of cryptographic solutions that enable ownership by consent. A burgeoning, healthy and ethical crypto-asset industry can help prevent malign activity – and maybe, just maybe, change public and governmental perceptions. For a first step in this direction, one might look to an estimate from Chainalysis: Earlier this year, the blockchain specialists said that transactions involving illicit wallets represented just 0.15% of cryptocurrency transaction volumes last year. Yet widespread skepticism remains, and machine learning and predictive analytics are not a panacea for malign activity. Put aside, for one moment, a series of outrageous NFT "" rug pulls "" and barely concealed market-manipulation schemes. There are reasons to suppose financial crime is less prevalent than other regulated activities and eminently detectable – and therefore preventable. For example, blockchain analytics can go further and faster than traditional finance to unravel the perpetrators of criminality. It is not flippant to say that, were the blockchain in existence at the time, the Watergate follow-the-money scandal or Bernie Madoff’s giant Ponzi scheme might have been stopped earlier. Law enforcement, intelligence agencies, policymakers and the private sector are part of the same critical ecosystem fighting financial crime. If the entire system works together, the crypto sector could become a force leader. Buy-in at all levels How can historical and ongoing concerns be assuaged? Several quick wins come to mind. The fight against financial crime starts with the implementation of a compliance-focused culture within the crypto sector. By prioritizing compliance as a fundamental pillar of how crypto firms operate, organizations will help change perceptions among regulators, law enforcement and traditional finance. Read More:  Are Crypto Assets Securities? But buy-in must be achieved at all levels within an organization, supported by a strong tone from the top. This partly depends on refining the image of the sector away from ""crypto bros"" and profit before ethics. Philosophical debates about decentralization will not cut the mustard with regulators. Without such organization-wide backing for compliance, the best systems, policies and controls will be washed away, heightening the risk of illicit proceeds getting into the system. The crypto-asset industry is in a good position to advocate and promote best practices internally, with the external benefit of assuaging broader concerns. Organizations must actively seek practical solutions to prove their commitment. The sector has the opportunity to make a moral commitment to tackling the personal and societal harms inflicted by financial crime when it is enabled by crypto-asset technology – a crypto constitution, if you will. In its simplest form, this means cultural change implemented by training and awareness building, an informed understanding of financial crime threats and a campaign to develop industry standards. Start with a strong cross-sector statement outlining the policy (and all-important redlines) for dealing with crypto  mixers  and  privacy coins . Additionally, consider the opportunities for sharing actionable intelligence with banking partners. This will require support from regulators and established public-private partnerships. Crypto-asset service providers could reciprocate by instigating a pilot project testing nonbinding disclosure of information made possible under Section 314(b) of the  USA Patriot Act . A sandbox environment for joint training with law enforcement might stipulate what should happen were an investigation to cross over into the crypto-asset domain. This approach would help to address technological challenges, internal anti-money-laundering controls and an industry response to high-harm threats such as ransomware. Consider the inherent advantages open to crypto assets – the immutability of the blockchain, its inherent traceability and a distributed ledger that can withstand criminal efforts to double-spend legitimate coins. These built-in advantages should bode well compared with repeated traditional finance scandals. With goodwill (on all sides), such quick wins might be building blocks for that bridge of trust.

binance,Policy,US Regulators Investigating Binance’s BNB Token: Report,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is examining whether Binance’s initial coin offering of its Binance coin (BNB) token in 2017 was an unregistered security offering that should have been registered with the regulatory agency,  Bloomberg reported  Monday, citing confidential sources. Without commenting on the details of the reported probe, a spokesperson for Binance told CoinDesk via email, ""As the industry has grown at a rapid pace, we have been working very diligently to educate and assist law enforcement and regulators in the U.S. and internationally, while also adhering to new guidelines. We will continue to meet all requirements set by regulators."" BNB was trading down 4% after news of the report came out. Binance is currently under investigation in the U.S. by the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) and the Internal Revenue Service. Binance is the world’s biggest crypto exchange and says it’s not domiciled in any one country. The SEC is also investigating market-making companies owned or partially owned by Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao that do business with  Binance.US , a U.S.-based affiliate of the global exchange, according to a person familiar with the review, Bloomberg reported. According to the report, one of the SEC’s focuses is on whether  Binance.US  is wholly independent of the global exchange and whether employees may be involved in insider trading. An SEC spokesperson declined to comment on the existence of any possible probe.

binance,Business,Apifiny Courts Quant Traders With Crypto Code Library,"Apifiny Group is pitching high-frequency crypto traders with an out-of-the box code library that it claims will help stand up their systems fast. The new product, Apifiny Algo, is a collection of prewritten C++ programs for accessing coin data, placing orders and executing trades in time-sensitive markets, CEO Haohan Xu told CoinDesk. It’s targeted at the growing cadre of crypto-curious institutional traders who would otherwise build their code from scratch. “Today, most of the  quant  traders who are looking to do the same thing, they’ll go on GitHub, find some open-source code someone’s already written,” Xu said. But that system is “probably not perfect.” They still have to retrofit the code, test it, vet it and hope it's fast enough to retain an edge, he said. By contrast, Xu said Apifiny Algo is optimized for high-performance trading and speed. It plugs into Binance,  Binance.US , FTX, Huobi, OKX and Okcoin crypto exchanges, he said. The new product comes as Apifiny looks ahead to go public via a planned special purpose acquisition company ( SPAC ) deal scheduled to close later this year. It would become a rare crypto company trading on U.S. public markets, alongside Coinbase, whose stock has been hammered and is down nearly 80% since launch. “Based on the latest progress, we are anticipating to finish the process and be listed in Q3,” Xu said of the firm’s listing plans. “As we inch towards becoming a public company, partnerships with exchanges like Okcoin will help us complete our ecosystem for professional traders.”",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/06/07/apifiny-courts-quant-traders-with-crypto-code-library/,coindesk,2022-06-07,13:50:00,en,254,1548,5.086614173228346,85,0.3346456692913386,apifiny group pitching frequency crypto trader code library claim stand system product apifiny algo collection prewritten program accessing coin data placing order executing trade time sensitive market ceo haohan told coindesk targeted growing cadre crypto curious institutional trader build code scratch today quant trader thing github find open source code written system perfect retrofit code test vet retain contrast apifiny algo optimized performance trading plug binance binance ftx huobi okx okcoin crypto exchange product apifiny ahead public planned special purpose acquisition company spac scheduled rare crypto company trading public market alongside coinbase hammered launch based latest progress anticipating finish process listed firm listing plan inch public company partnership exchange okcoin complete ecosystem professional trader,0.16593406593406596,positive,0.5285714285714286,"{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.87, 'pos': 0.13, 'compound': 0.9349}",0.9349,0.0,0.87,0.13,positive,0.33333322222225925,0.02752293552731252,positive
binance,Business,Binance.US Launches Crypto Staking Assault on Rivals Coinbase and Gemini,"Binance.US , the American arm of the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, has launched a blockchain staking product promising high yields on staked crypto, with the aim of outflanking similar offerings from rival U.S.-based exchanges. The staking service – where users lock in assets to support  proof-of-stake (PoS)  networks – enables users to earn up to an 18% annual percentage yield (APY) on certain tokens, the company announced on Tuesday. The PoS blockchains  Binance.US  supports include Audius (AUDIO), Avalanche (AVAX), BNB Chain, Cosmos (ATOM), Livepeer (LPT), Solana (SOL) and The Graph (GRT). More tokens will be added in the near future,  Binance.US  said. Big exchanges simplify the staking of crypto tokens, for which they take a slice of the yield generated by the coins.  Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder  said the plan is to outdo staking APYs on the likes of Coinbase and Gemini. Shroder said staking Cosmos blockchain’s ATOM token will generate a yield of 12.2% APY on  Binance.US , while something like the smaller market cap Livepeer token could promise up to an 18% yield on LPT. “We wanted to put out a product that would unquestionably be the best staking platform in the United States by the end of the year,” Shroder said in an interview. “So, for comparison purposes, we’re looking at the Coinbases, the Geminis, Krakens and BlockFis of this world, both in terms of more competitive returns and usability.” M&A season? All told,  Binance.US  appears to be in good health, notwithstanding signs of an approaching crypto winter; Shroder says the firm has “plenty of dry powder” to pursue acquisitions further down the line. He also took the opportunity to point out that, in contrast to the  dismal job news coming out of Coinbase and Gemini , his firm is hiring. “We are hiring Coinbase and Gemini people onto our staff,” Shroder said. “There’s a lot of talent from those organizations that are applying to our open positions and we are actively interviewing them.” Last week, Coinbase announced a hiring freeze and said it would rescind offers to applicants who had accepted jobs at the exchange. Gemini, meanwhile, said it would lay off 10% of its staff.

binance, Altcoin Watch , BNB price risks 40% drop as SEC launches probe against Binance  ,"BNB  price dropped by nearly 7.3% on June 7 to below $275, its lowest level in three weeks. What's more, BNB price could drop by another 25%–40% in 2022 as its parent firm, Binance, faces allegations of  breaking securities rules  and laundering billions of dollars in illicit funds for criminals. Bad news twice in a row BNB was issued as  a part of an initial coin offering  (ICO) in 2017 that amassed $15 million for Binance.  The token mainly behaves as a utility asset within the Binance ecosystem, primarily enabling traders to earn discounts on their trading activities. Simultaneously, BNB also functions as a speculative financial asset, which has made it the fifth-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.  BNB market capitalization was $45.42 billion as of June 7. Source: CoinMarketCap As a result, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether the ICO of BNB tokens in 2017 was a sale of securities that should have been registered with the regulator,  according  to sources contacted by Bloomberg. So, will all exchanges including binance delist  $BNB  like they did with  $XRP ? — Crypto Mark    ❄️ (@MarkCrypto8)  June 6, 2022 
 
 This risks putting downward pressure on BNB's price, which has already lost more than half of its value after peaking out in May 2021 at around $700. BNB holds above May–July 2021 support In addition to the bad news, BNB's plunge also came as a part of a broader correction trend elsewhere in the crypto market, with top coins Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) dipping by 7% and 7.25% on the same day.  $BNB  aggressively shorted because of the FUD.  pic.twitter.com/BzvGtPcK3d — Byzantine General (@ByzGeneral)  June 6, 2022 
 
 Now, BNB tests the 61.8 Fib retracement level (near $274) of the Fibonacci retracement graph sketched from its $10-swing low to $700-swing high. Interestingly, the same level was instrumental as support during the May–July 2021 session that preceded a 170% price rally. But weak fundamentals, including the  Federal Reserve's hawkish policy , have raised BNB's possibility of dropping below the 61.8 Fib line.  Related:  The crypto market dropped in May, but June has a silver lining If this happens, then BNB's next downside target could be its 200-week exponential moving average (200-week EMA; the blue wave) near $200, down about 25% from June 7's price.  The BNB/USD pair's weekly relative strength index (RSI), now at 34, also shows more room to drop until the reading hits 30, an oversold level that indicates buying sentiment.

Conversely, if BNB manages to hold strong above $274, it could rebound toward the area defined by its 0.5 Fib line around $355 and its 50-week EMA (the red wave) near $380, up over 20% from the current price level.

binance, News , Bad day for Binance with SEC investigation and Reuters exposé ,"The United States Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating whether Binance Holdings broke securities rules when it launched its  BNB  token in an initial coin offering (ICO) five years ago, Bloomberg reported on Monday.  Binance is the world’s largest crypto exchange, and BNB is the fifth-largest cryptocurrency. The BNB  ICO took place in July 2017  on several platforms during the height of the so-called ICO boom, and the Binance exchange opened just days afterward. According to Bloomberg,  citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, at least one U.S. resident claimed to have taken part in the ICO, which could be a crucial fact for an SEC case, if the agency chose to pursue one. The SEC has claimed most cryptocurrencies are securities and brought cases against a number of ICO projects. Binance founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao, often known as “CZ,” said in a 2020  blog post  that the wording of the BNB white paper was changed in January 2019 because “the potential for being misunderstood as a security is higher in certain regions.” Binance’s American arm, Binance.US, was created later that year. Related:  Binance wins dismissal of class action over 2018 tokens that tanked Also on Monday, Reuters  published  a lengthy special report alleging that Binance processed at least $2.35 billion of transactions from hacks, investment frauds and narcotics sales between 2017 and 2021, and had weak Know Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering protections for those years. Among other cases, Reuters mentions  the hacking of Eterbase , with some of the proceeds being laundered through Binance by North Korean hacker group Lazarus, and Binance’s association with  Russian-language drug mart Hydra .  A Binance spokesperson disputed Reuters’ findings, and the exchange  told  Forbes in a statement that the report is a “woefully misinformed op-ed that uses outdated information from 2019 and unverified personal attestations.” Binance is already the object of  several U.S. federal investigations, including another SEC probe . The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission  began an investigation of the exchange’s  trading practices last year. Binance Markets, its United Kingdom branch,  was ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority  to cease activities in that county after a review of its operations last year.

Stablecoins have been among the most revolutionary aspects of the crypto ecosystem. They’ve empowered the unbanked and created a semistable space in an incredibly volatile industry. Stablecoins have also established common ground between central banks, regulators and decentralized players. Nevertheless, we need to stay grounded. Through informed decision-making, users can reduce their exposure to the wild risks seen with Terra. So while the current atmosphere may seem hostile, we have a unique opportunity to show the world that secure, regulated stablecoins exist. Why stablecoins are essential Stablecoins are incredibly important in the crypto ecosystem. Whether you're a simple "" HODLer "" investing spare change or a veteran trader, you can find a need for stablecoins. For many in the crypto world, remembering a time without stablecoins is difficult. Creating a successful way to maintain stable value without off-ramping into  fiat  was revolutionary. Exiting a position into fiat currency can take days and increase costs. With this in mind, keeping value stable and on-chain in a trusted way can hugely improve liquidity. Read More:  The Fall of Terra: A Timeline of the Meteoric Rise and Crash of UST and LUNA Stablecoins also bring vital financial services to the unbanked and sufferers of rampant inflation. Rising consumer costs must no longer devour your savings when you can maintain their value with a reputable stablecoin. Closely related are remittances, as family and friends can cheaply and almost instantly transfer money globally with a stablecoin. Don’t underestimate stringent requirements I've often encountered the mindset that stablecoins offer a crypto panacea. The top 10 coins and tokens by market capitalization have always maintained a significant stablecoin presence. They've even provided ways to earn tempting, high annual percentage yields (APYs) in the crypto world with a stable asset. It almost sounds too good to be true. But as we've seen with Terra, the house of cards can quickly collapse. The benefits of stablecoins are immense, but they can be doomed to fail without responsible, regulated mechanisms to support them. To me, there are several issues at play here, and they don't all involve the stablecoin issuer. First, I want to discuss a crucial point many people don't understand: Not all stablecoins operate with the same principles. Reserves-backed stablecoins Most large stablecoins available are reserves-based. Some coins, like Binance USD ( BUSD ), maintain cash reserves that are periodically attested, regulated and guaranteed. Others hold various assets, including commercial paper, bonds and crypto. Even within this category, the ratio of reserves to issued coins can be a contentious topic. For full stability, a reserve level of 100% should also be maintained. Of all available options, reserves-backed stablecoins typically provide the most user security. Algorithmic stablecoins Another commonly used model is  algorithmic-based . You'll likely have heard the term recently, as this was terraUSD's (UST) operating model. These coins have little or no collateral backing and use algorithms to incentivize investor behavior. By affecting market demand and supply, an algorithmic stablecoin attempts to maintain its peg. Terra, for example, tried to  peg  each coin to the U.S. dollar by being transferable at a 1:1 rate with $1 of LUNA. Converting 1 UST to $1 of LUNA and vice versa would burn the coin you provided, effectively manipulating supply. Even with the brief description, the cracks are already visible. Pegging to the U.S. dollar through a  seigniorage  mechanism with your own token is a dangerous position. Acting like a central bank may look tempting, but we already know the limits their real-life counterparts have. Terra exposed the algorithmic method's flaws Many people in the crypto industry understood the Terra model’s limitations even before the protocol’s  crash . Now Terra’s vulnerabilities are more widely known. Terra printing money like the Federal Reserve didn't create value; it diluted it for existing holders. Having a small number of reserves also made repegging the stablecoin difficult at best. Also, tempting 20% APY returns on  Anchor  staking incentivized demand for a stablecoin that had little backing in value. How did we get to where we are today? So with these flaws visible, why was everyone jumping on the Terra train? Consider the following reasons. There was a general misunderstanding. I often wonder if many Terra investors understood what was maintaining its peg and generating such high APYs. As with any investment, you should always fully understand what you're investing in and how it works. To me, education plays a huge role in ensuring this never happens again. Investors dreamed of creating quick monetary value. Some crypto enthusiasts have critiqued the traditional central bank model and derided it for its inflationary practices. However, when given a chance to operate like a central bank themselves, the blockchain community forgot the lessons from years of economic history, leading to an unsustainable  tokenomic  model with flawed incentives. The community overlooked the importance of regulation. While many crypto enthusiasts see regulation as a foe, it can actually be a friend. To me, the recent Terra situation shows how unregulated stablecoins can dramatically fail without regulation. The importance of regulatory cooperation The regulatory process is not perfect and must change. The relationship between regulators and stablecoin issuers must develop and grow. An existential fear of stablecoins? A number of media pundits have inferred that central banks, governments and regulators view digital assets pegged to fiat as an existential threat. This is a misperception. The security of these institutions’ national fiat currencies and sovereignty isn’t at risk. However, this sentiment may have led to a scramble to create central bank digital currencies ( CBDC ), heightened fears about stablecoins and pushed stablecoin projects out of the market. Stablecoin fear is misguided Much of this fear is, however, misguided. Not all stablecoins are created equal, and many provide a superior experience through sound reserves, oversight and attestations. A 100% reserve-backed stablecoin is easier for a regulator to stomach than an algorithmic one creating dollar value out of nothing. Regulators need support to alleviate any fears As much as regulators may worry about the outcome, the reality is that properly managed stablecoins currently aren't a threat to financial stability. Read More:  The Collapse of UST and LUNA Was Devastating, but There Is Still Hope for Crypto The crypto community must be willing to engage with regulators, educate them and demonstrate responsible stablecoin models to foster a better understanding. We must also be mindful of regulators’ concerns and learn from their years of financial experience. How can we all work together? As an industry, we can begin to ease regulatory concerns by encouraging a broader debate. While financial stability is essential, it's not the only factor at play here. Greater consumer choice, competition and innovation will improve the stablecoin experience for all stakeholders. With innovation and competition come new players in the market, but a natural aversion to change can leave regulators reluctant to work with new market entrants. So far, we've seen an approach that tends to prioritize those legacy winners deemed “too big to fail.” This has led to the protection of incumbents in the name of stability. Often, newcomers provide a broader perspective on various topics that regulators have in their sights, including financial crime, financial stability, market integrity and consumer protection. Real-deal stablecoins already exist So what's the ideal situation for a  stablecoin ? As we already covered, the most reliable stablecoin is fiat-backed. Taking this further, reserves should back the issued asset 100%, be attestable and maintained in cash or cash equivalents. Finally, we can't forget the role of regulators in ensuring these assets maintain high financial standards and provide appropriate backing. USDP from Paxos is one example that meets all our criteria. It holds monthly attestations of its reserves and guarantees users can always switch between USDP and USD at a 1:1 rate. USDP also has a regulated status through the ​​New York State Department of Financial Services (NYDFS). To ensure we provided the same safeguards with  BUSD , we chose Paxos as our issuance partner. This cooperation provides BUSD holders with the same benefits USDP offers: A 1:1 secure and compliant USD-backed stablecoin regulated by the NYDFS. Actual cash and cash equivalent reserves consisting of 96% cash and 4% U.S. Treasury bills. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.-insurance. If BUSD is compromised, the reserves are insured and safe. Users don't need to worry about losing any value on their BUSD holdings. Monthly attestation of the reserves. These reports independently verify the entire BUSD token supply is backed by fiat in U.S. banks held and managed by Paxos. Read More:  Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference? Let’s make the most of this period of reflection Terra's situation has profoundly affected the crypto industry in value, trust and reputation. Nevertheless, there is a great opportunity to build back stronger. During the current correction, we have time to develop real applications as a basis for solid growth rather than high APY pipe dreams. Regulators are even keener to further their dialogue with stablecoin issuers. In a way, the market has separated exceptional from lesser models. We can be thankful for that. Crypto has developed at such a rapid speed that regulation is still fragmented and lacks harmonization. The situation constantly evolves, and so does our approach to meeting all new requirements. When it comes to stablecoins, we're proud to lead the way in regulation through BUSD. We're also happy to show the whole industry how they can responsibly issue stablecoins. The recent crash and Terra situation have created an opportunity for us all to cooperate, learn and educate one another.

binance,Business,Binance.US Accused of Misleading Investors in Class-Action Lawsuit Over Terra,"“Those of you waiting for the earth to become unstable – I'm afraid you will be waiting until the age of men expires.” These  confident words  tweeted by Terra blockchain founder Do Kwon sought to convince crypto investors to put their trust (and money) into terraUSD (UST), a  stablecoin  that Kwon promised would always stay priced at exactly $1. Unfortunately, Kwon’s confidence was not enough to save UST and the rest of Terra as his entire project  dropped to zero . Now, over 2,000 Terra investors say false marketing is what caused them to lose their money. In a  class-action lawsuit filed Monday  in The United States District Court for the Northern District of California,  centralized  cryptocurrency exchange  Binance.US  has been accused of misleading investors surrounding the Terra blockchain ecosystem. The suit marks the first major U.S.-based court filing relating to Terra, whose UST and LUNC tokens wiped out around $40 billion in investor funds when they  crashed  to pennies last month. The suit, which was filled by U.S.-based law firm Roche Freedman LLP, alleges that Binance.US marketed Terra’s dollar-based UST as more stable than it actually was. According to the suit, when UST and its sister token luna classic (LUNC) crashed to zero in May, thousands of unsuspecting retail investors were caught completely off guard. Misleading advertising is what the suit says is to blame for those losses. The lawsuit also alleges that Binance.US is not registered as a broker-deal or an exchange, which may be in violation of securities law after it listed what might be an unregistered security in UST. The suit is also aimed at Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder. In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Kyle Roche, one of Roche Freedman's founding partners, said “Binance U.S. recklessly listed and promoted UST as a ‘safe’ stablecoin to those seeking to avoid the volatility of other cryptocurrencies. They, as well as other exchanges that listed UST, should be held accountable."" Binance.US disputes the allegations made in the lawsuit. "" Binance.US  is registered by  FinCEN  and adheres to all applicable regulations. These assertions are without merit and we will defend ourselves vigorously,"" the company said in a statement to CoinDesk. While a successful suit would send chills down the spines of some decentralized finance ( DeFi ) founders and centralized exchange CEOs, it would embolden DeFi advocates who think decentralized tools for participating in crypto finance – rather than centralized exchanges – are necessary to avoid government censorship and burdensome regulations moving forward. The Terra crash Along with seasoned big-money backers like Hashed and Jump Crypto, the Terra collapse drained the wallets of thousands of unsuspecting retail investors. In the days following Terra’s decline, its largest  Reddit forum  was filled with accounts of suicides (and above them, extensive resources on how those struggling could find help). The forum also featured criticism of Terra’s highly vocal co-founder – Do Kwon. Kwon, according to some Terra watchers, is primarily to blame for hyping up the promise that UST would always sit safely at $1. Just as he was making brash assurances around the security of UST, Kwon was building a system that onlookers like Kevin Zhou of crypto hedge fund Galois Capital said was  built to fail . Upon these questionable foundations, Kwon nonetheless promoted the safety of UST (and its luna sister token) ceaselessly across social media – loudly dismissing critics like Zhou. Even as UST first began to wobble off of its $1 peg (just a few days before it ultimately crashed), Kwon  tweeted  “Anon, you could listen to CT influensooors about UST depegging for the 69th time, Or you could remember they’re all now poor, and go for a run instead.” Deriding critics with adjectives like “poor” was not out of character for Kwon, but the founder was unusually silent for several days as his ecosystem eventually cratered. The question now is whether Kwon or his company will ultimately join Binance.US in facing potential legal penalties for their role in promoting Terra. A  government panel  is already awaiting Kwon in his native South Korea, and the  U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  has been nipping at Terraform Labs’ heels for years. Kwon has reportedly been living in Singapore for the last several months, but today’s lawsuit adds to the evidence that Kwon will soon face legal battles around the world. Even so, Kwon’s Terraform Labs – which held a central role in creating the Terra ecosystem – has yet to face a class-action lawsuit like this one. Apparently, it won’t have to wait for long. According to FatMan – a member of the Terra Research Forum and a vocal critic of Terra with a large Twitter following – a suit against Terraform Labs is also coming, and it is likely to look similar to this one. FatMan helped orchestrate Monday’s suit by organizing a group of 2,000 aggrieved Terra investors who allege they were misled by a number of entities. FatMan told CoinDesk: ""We will begin by filing mass arbitrations & class actions against the various exchanges. I will be helping them with some outreach (connecting to victims) but I have no real special role in the exchange suits. Then soon after we will file against TFL/Jump."" On the Binance.US suit, they added: ""Centralized exchanges have become highly accessible to the general public – even my parents use them – and as such, it is virtually a moral imperative for them to uphold a high standard of truth and risk disclosure. Telling people an asset is fiat-backed when it is not is fraudulent. ""Telling people a coin is 1:1 pegged to the US dollar and selling it alongside USDC and USDT without the relevant risk disclosures is scummy. People were roped in with siren calls of 'safe, stable yields' - but no attempt to help them actually understand what they were buying was made. This is morally unconscionable, and, in my opinion, it should be illegal."" Looking ahead Should the suit succeed, it will prove monumental in defining the legal status of DeFi, which has thus far avoided clear regulations or heavy government oversight. Moreover, the fact that today’s suit seeks to hold a centralized exchange culpable for a token’s advertising – rather than the organization that launched it – will hold wide implications for the shape of DeFi moving forward. It may portend a world where centralized exchanges are forced to more closely vet the tokens they support on their platforms.

binance,Business,Binance.US Targeting $50M Follow-On Raise at $4.5B Valuation,"Binance.US , the American arm of the crypto exchange giant, is looking to raise up to $50 million in additional funding at a $4.5 billion valuation in what would be a continuation of the exchange’s seed round, according to people familiar with the matter. The company previously  closed  a $200 million seed round at a $4.5 billion valuation in April. The raise will target ""strategic partners"" and would not represent a new Series A round, the people said.  Binance.US  declined to comment. Since April, cryptocurrency markets have seen a sharp downturn, fueled by several high-profile blowups, liquidity crises and  macroeconomic events . Binance.US’ raise comes on the heels of last month’s  unraveling  of Terra’s UST stablecoin, as well as two high-profile events this month – crypto lender Celsius  halting  customer withdrawals and crypto investment firm Three Arrows Capital facing  rumored  insolvency. Binance.US CEO Brian Shroder  told  tech outlet Protocol last week that the soon-to-be-announced fundraise will have the company “entering the crypto winter from a position of strength.” “Investors are not scared from investing in us further,” Shroder added.

binance,Opinion,"The Case for Suing Celsius, Terraform Labs","After a series of apparent collapses, defaults and liquidity crises across protocols like Terra and crypto-affiliated lending platforms and hedge funds, we’re seeing the first signs of what is likely to be a wave of legal action from users and investors who lost money. But those cases will require navigating some tricky questions. Because lending protocols in particular have been studiously vague in describing the exact nature of their services, it's not clear what sort of responsibilities these companies have when it comes to depositor's funds. This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full  newsletter here . “The jury is still out on that,” according to Marcelo Diaz-Cortes, a securities litigation lawyer with the Miami-based firm LKLSG. Diaz-Cortes contrasts currently distressed crypto projects with straightforward fraud cases he’s helped litigate, such as  Argyle Coin , a supposedly diamond-backed token that was in reality a Ponzi scheme. “It was a straight fraud – it didn’t really exist.” That wasn’t the case with the most dramatic collapse of recent weeks, the unwinding of the TerraUSD “algorithmic stablecoin” in May. That token’s design was so deeply flawed that its demise was  easy for experts to predict  – but its mechanism was described transparently and, it seems, mostly accurately. “It wasn’t a secret as to how the thing functioned,” Diaz-Cortes said. “If that was the way it really worked, [judging it fraudulent] would be a tough sell for a court, for a jury.” That doesn’t mean there’s no case. In standard securities cases, fraud can still be found “when someone at the company or promoting it had a little extra knowledge and didn’t disclose it,” according to Diaz-Cortes. A court might, for instance, examine statements from Do Kwon or Terraform Labs about transitioning UST to a backed model, or rumors that the token was secretly bailed out by third parties when it previously lost its peg in  May of 2021 . Either could imply that, despite public statements, the team knew its creation didn’t actually work as advertised. Another good sign for anyone pursuing relief directly from Terra’s creators is that they appear to now be under investigation in Korea, one of the group’s centers of operation. While such investigations are usually kept under wraps until they conclude, they can still provide firepower for plaintiffs. “It’s certainly something we put in our complaints,” Diaz-Cortes said. “Look, the government’s sniffing, the government filed an action. … At hearings, we’ll point to it as circumstantial evidence of something fishy going on.” Some wiped-out Lunatics have instead focused legal firepower on the exchanges, with one class-action suit targeting  Binance.US , an exchange that sold the UST token and described it, according to the complaint, as “safe.” Diaz-Cortes believes such suits against exchanges could have legs if an exchange or other promoter was “not completely forthright about the potential [risk] exposure.” See also:  What Crypto Can Learn From Elizabeth Holmes' Fraud  | Opinion The same group of plaintiffs, which includes pseudonymous Terra victim and researcher Fatman, has said it will also file suit against Terraform Labs, the entity that created a litany of apps – like the lending protocol Anchor – that used the LUNA and UST tokens. That possibility highlights one of the key underlying points in the Terra case: Despite leaning on the rhetoric of “decentralization,” Terra was tightly controlled by a small inner group. That could in and of itself become further grounds for claims of misrepresentation and fraud. Is Celsius a bank? The “lending platform” Celsius could be accused of similarly exaggerated claims – while it tied itself rhetorically to DeFi, or decentralized finance, it is an entirely centralized entity that merely acted as an intermediary to DeFi. That also makes it a ripe target for lawsuits after it froze withdrawals – potentially a prelude to default. One early, if flaccid, signal came from YouTube influencer BitBoy, who last week announced his intent to file a class action against Celsius after it froze his funds. Just days later, BitBoy withdrew the proposal after remembering that he had been  paid to promote Celsius , as he was for years paid directly to  promote scams . This is the epitome of the extremely useful expression “ hoisted by his own petard. ” Truly a shame. Regardless, more competent actors are sure to draw a bead on Celsius. The problem is that it and similar “lending platforms” have avoided clear classification and regulation. Depositors seeking high yields often used these platforms as crypto banks, despite the lack of regulation and consumer protections. In fact, recent regulatory actions taken against interest-bearing accounts at lending platform BlockFi characterize the offerings as  unregistered securities . BlockFi itself  isn’t facing  quite the same financial problems as Celsius, so it might not wind up a target of private lawsuits. But if a court thinks Celsius or a similar platform were also actually selling securities rather than banking services, it could be harmful for depositors because buying a security doesn’t imply any right to redeem it for a specific price. Another legal question is what Celsius actually did with depositors’ money to earn the yield it passed onto them. As CoinDesk  reported this month , the platform began pursuing increasingly risky strategies starting in early 2021, including sending client funds to volatile DeFi “yield farms,” later including Luna’s Anchor protocol. Though Celsius apparently  withdrew funds from Anchor  before the Terra collapse, the general investment strategy could face scrutiny in court. Under conventional banking law, there’s no duty to disclose the loans or other strategies used to generate yield on customer deposits. “[Banks] don’t owe customers special duties of care. They just owe those deposits back when you ask for it,” Diaz-Cortes said. “You’re not able to bring in issues as to, ‘you shouldn’t have done this with the money.’” He added that “it’s just a black and white thing” whether banks can meet their obligations and “not necessarily fraud” if they’ve re-hypothecated funds. See also:  How the Feds Are Prosecuting an NFT Insider Trading Scheme  | Opinion But that’s only true up to a certain point. “The question will be whether they did something reckless, fraudulent and irresponsible” with client funds, Diaz-Cortes said. “It’s going to come down to what they knew and what was happening behind the curtain.” Alternatively, plaintiffs might argue that Celsius wasn’t a bank at all but rather a broker investing on their behalf. “In terms of these crypto deposit accounts, they’re a little bit of both [bank and brokerage],” Diaz-Cortes said. “You’re not just putting $10 in and expecting $10 back. You’re leaving it there [to earn] interest.” That could lower the bar for what counts as fraud, according to Diaz-Cortes. “With brokerage accounts, sometimes you do get those claims that this was advertised as a safe investment, and you breached the duty.”",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/06/24/the-case-for-suing-celsius-terraform-labs/,coindesk,2022-06-24,16:58:00,en,1154,7210,5.2331022530329285,454,0.3934142114384749,series apparent collapse default liquidity crisis protocol crypto affiliated lending platform fund sign wave legal action user investor lost case require navigating tricky question lending protocol studiously vague describing exact nature service clear sort responsibility company depositor fund article excerpted node coindesk roundup pivotal story blockchain crypto news subscribe full newsletter jury security litigation miami based firm lklsg contrast distressed crypto project straightforward fraud case helped litigate argyle coin supposedly backed token reality ponzi scheme fraud exist dramatic collapse recent unwinding terrausd algorithmic stablecoin token design deeply flawed demise easy expert predict mechanism transparently accurately secret thing functioned worked judging fraudulent tough court jury standard security case fraud found company promoting extra knowledge disclose court instance examine statement terraform lab transitioning ust backed model rumor token secretly bailed party previously lost imply public statement team knew creation work advertised sign pursuing relief directly creator investigation korea group center operation investigation wrap conclude provide firepower plaintiff put complaint government sniffing government filed action hearing point circumstantial evidence fishy wiped lunatic focused legal firepower exchange class action suit targeting binance exchange sold ust token complaint safe belief suit exchange leg exchange promoter completely forthright potential risk exposure crypto learn fraud opinion group plaintiff includes pseudonymous victim researcher fatman file suit terraform lab entity created litany apps lending protocol anchor ust token possibility highlight underlying point leaning rhetoric decentralization tightly controlled group ground claim misrepresentation fraud celsius bank lending platform celsius accused similarly exaggerated claim tied rhetorically defi decentralized finance centralized entity acted intermediary defi make ripe target lawsuit froze withdrawal potentially prelude default flaccid signal youtube influencer bitboy announced intent file class action celsius froze fund day bitboy withdrew proposal remembering paid promote celsius year paid directly promote scam epitome extremely expression hoisted petard shame competent actor draw bead celsius problem similar lending platform avoided clear classification regulation depositor seeking yield platform crypto lack regulation consumer protection fact recent regulatory action interest bearing account lending platform blockfi characterize offering unregistered security blockfi facing financial problem celsius wind target private lawsuit court think celsius similar platform selling security banking service harmful depositor buying security imply redeem specific legal question celsius depositor earn yield passed coindesk reported platform began pursuing increasingly risky strategy starting including sending client fund volatile defi yield farm including anchor protocol celsius apparently withdrew fund anchor collapse general investment strategy face scrutiny court conventional banking disclose loan strategy generate yield customer deposit owe customer special duty care owe deposit bring issue added thing meet obligation necessarily fraud hypothecated fund fed prosecuting nft insider trading scheme opinion point question reckless fraudulent irresponsible client fund knew happening curtain alternatively plaintiff argue celsius bank broker investing behalf term crypto deposit account bit bank brokerage putting expecting leaving earn interest bar fraud brokerage account claim advertised safe investment breached,0.014639249639249636,positive,0.3995021645021645,"{'neg': 0.19, 'neu': 0.687, 'pos': 0.123, 'compound': -0.9911}",-0.9911,0.19,0.687,0.123,negative,-0.9298245450907975,0.131034482457392,negative
binance,Opinion,New York Regulators Have Planted a Seed for Stablecoin Transparency,"Good news for stablecoin users: Stablecoin transparency standards are set to improve. This comes courtesy of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS), which  last month  issued formal guidance for NYDFS-approved stablecoin issuers, including upgrades to the amount and quality of information that issuers must provide to the public. J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. Increased transparency is a welcome development. It means users will have a better ability to vet stablecoins, and with more eyeballs on them, stablecoins issuers will be pressured to provide a safer product. The new regulations will directly apply to gemini dollar (GUSD), issued by Gemini Trust, and binance USD (BUSD) and paxos dollar (USDP), issued by Paxos Trust. Those stablecoins were introduced in 2018 when the NYDFS initiated its regulatory framework for stablecoins. Anyone who owns stablecoins that conforms to NYDFS standards will be able to sleep soundly at night The NYDFS is one of the most influential financial regulators in the world. By dint of peer pressure and customer demand, one hopes these improvements spread to other large, non-NYDFS-regulated stablecoins like USD coin, tether, trueUSD – and also to stablecoins yet to emerge. It’s all about the assets When people debate the intricacies of stablecoins, the most pressing thing they want to know is what backs the stablecoin. There are good reasons for that. With good old-fashioned bank deposits, a bank's deep layer of capital offers depositors a degree of protection should the bank's investments sour. Stablecoin issuers, however, lack the large amounts of capital that banks possess. Furthermore, unlike with bank deposits – which are insured by the government up to a certain amount – you're on your own if the stablecoin in your wallet fails. So the safety of a stablecoin is highly dependent on the assets that are backing it. That's why the topic of stablecoin backing attracts so much attention in the press and on social media, and why transparency is so important. The durability of a stablecoin’s underlying assets is important to more than just the people who own the stablecoin. It's also crucial to the broader crypto economy, because stablecoins act as the plumbing of crypto. If a major issuer like Tether were to fail, it would drive the entire ecosystem into a crisis. One way for people to gain sufficient confidence in a stablecoin is by getting a peek at its internal workings. A stablecoin issuer accommodates that by providing public information about the assets backing the stablecoin. By doing so, the issuer gives a stablecoin credibility, which may help it grow and earn more profits – but only if the public approves of what it has seen in the sausage-making process. To ensure the information about its assets can be trusted by the public, stablecoin issuers first pass it through the hands of an independent auditor. The auditor examines the information and offers its opinion on whether the numbers are accurately stated. Read more: JP Koning -  The Race for Stablecoin Transparency The practice of providing the public with independently verified insights into stablecoin assets emerged in 2018 when the issuers of newly created stablecoins USD coin, gemini dollar and paxos dollar began to work with auditors to publish monthly ""attestation"" reports. Three years later, in 2021, Tether – issuer of the largest stablecoin – began to publish its own  attestation reports , albeit quarterly. This glance behind the curtains through the mediation of an independent auditor ultimately provides users like you and me with useful information. But the glance that the public is afforded is good only if it is 1) timely, 2) provides a broad amount of useful information and 3) can be trusted. The NYDFS's new standards address those three issues. Timeliness The utility of information degrades as it gets older, especially in the fast-moving crypto economy. The NYDFS new guidance requires attestation reports to be published monthly and no later than 30 days after the end of the month. Stale attestation reports have been a problem among stablecoins issuers. In 2021, attestations for USDC  were arriving  50 days  after the attestation date . Tether's latest attestation was published  49 days after its March 31 attestation date . Users of this tardy information were left to speculate how the crypto declines of April, May and June may have affected Tether's finances. Tether and USD coin aren't NYDFS-regulated coins and thus their issuers aren’t required to conform to the NYDFS’ standards on timeliness. However, given that competitor Paxos is implementing the standards for binance USD, Tether and Circle, the issuer of USD coin, may have no choice but to conform. Completeness A long look behind the curtains is better than a quick glimpse. The NYDFS will broaden the amount of information available in attestation reports by requiring that stablecoin's assets be reported not only in aggregate, but also by asset class. So a stablecoin issuer would have to list how much commercial paper it owns, its allocation to money-market mutual funds, its deposits, its bonds and its quantity of Treasurys. That is, separately, instead of lumping it all together. Some stablecoin issuers like Tether already do that. But others don't. The attestations for binance USD, for instance, inform us that Paxos may own deposits at banks, Treasury bills or Treasury bonds, but doesn't reveal what the proportions are. Trustworthiness An auditor's approval isn't worth much if the stablecoin can game the system. Of the updates to NYDFS' guidance, the most important ones will improve the trustworthiness of stablecoin reports. There are two ways it will do that. First, the NYDFS will require auditors to not only examine a stablecoin’s end-of-the-month asset count, but also run a check on ""at least one randomly selected business day during the period."" Requiring a random in-between day examination prevents a stablecoin issuer from holding one set of risky assets for most of the month only to switch into safer assets the day before the auditor examines it. Tether in particular should consider adopting the NYDFS’ random in-between day test as a best practice. Tether's three-month interlude between examinations is much longer than its competitors. By having its auditor test one random day during that period in addition to the end-of-period day, Tether would provide users with much needed assurance. Second, the NYDFS will require that a stablecoin auditor provide an opinion on the effectiveness of a stablecoin issuer's internal controls. That must occur once a year. Internal controls are the rules and procedures that companies adopt to prevent mistakes and fraud. They include separation of duties, verification of invoices, reconciliation and controlled access to financial reporting systems. After the Enron and WorldCom scandals of the early 2000s, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act made it necessary for U.S. public companies to undergo regular audits of internal controls. At the present time, auditors that attest to the investments underlying stablecoins issued don't examine the effectiveness of an issuer's internal controls. An auditor need only acquire whatever ""degree of understanding"" of an issuer's internal controls that is necessary in order to carry out their assessment of its assets. That's why all attestation reports contain something to the effect that ""we did not test the operating effectiveness of such controls and express no such opinion on such controls."" (That's from the attestation for paxos dollar.) This is a black hole in current attestation practices. If internal controls aren't adequate, the numbers can’t be trusted. By requiring an auditor to examine a stablecoin issuer's internal controls every year to assure those controls are effective at promoting compliance with regulations, the NYDFS addresses this shortcoming. Circle and Tether should consider voluntarily submitting their internal controls to annual examination and so reach the standards being met by their New York competitors. Because an organization's internal controls offer vital protection against fraud, anyone who owns stablecoins that conforms to NYDFS standards will be able to sleep soundly at night.",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/07/06/new-york-regulators-have-planted-a-seed-for-stablecoin-transparency/,coindesk,2022-07-06,16:34:00,en,1337,8442,5.30890052356021,548,0.4098728496634256,news

binance, How to crypto , What is BNB auto-burn and how does it work?  ,"BNB and its role in the blockchain ecosystem Binance Coin ( BNB ) is the Binance ecosystem’s native cryptocurrency. Launched in 2017, BNB was originally presented as an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain with a total supply of 200 million. In 2019, Binance started its mainnet swap and migrated all BNB tokens to BNB Chain. Related:  A beginner’s guide to the BNB Chain: The evolution of the Binance Smart Chain BNB Chain is composed of two blockchains,  both powered by BNB : BNB Beacon Chain: Previously called Binance Chain, this blockchain handles BNB Chain governance functions such as voting and staking. BNB Smart Chain (BSC): Once known as the Binance Smart Chain, this blockchain uses the Ethereum Virtual Machine to support smart contracts and is fully compatible with Ethereum’s tools and  decentralized apps (DApps) . The native  Binance Coin  is now an essential part of the Binance ecosystem. It is used to power the operations of the Binance and Binance.US exchanges, including other applications built on the BNB Chain, such as: PancakeSwap Biswap ApeSwap Autoshark Finance Avarice  Libera.Financial Nominex/Nomiswap The age of dinosaurs DEX Finance Open Leverage These are just a few of the many dApps  built  on the BNB blockchain. Binance also remains the largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volume and is one of the most popular exchanges in the world. What is a coin burn? A coin burn is when a cryptocurrency project destroys some of its coins, often to reduce the circulating supply and increase the value of the remaining coins. The coins are sent to a  dead crypto wallet  with an unknown private key, which means that these coins can never be spent again. Coin burns are often conducted on a quarterly or semi-annual basis. Binance, for example, has committed to burning BNB coins every quarter until 100 million BNB are destroyed. This will leave a total supply of 100 million BNB — the maximum possible supply of BNB. Related:  Buyback-and-burn: What does it mean in crypto? Blockchains and crypto protocols do periodic  coin burns and token burns  for a couple of reasons, including: How is BNB burned? There are coin-burning mechanisms by which BNB is burned, as explained below: Real-time burning mechanism (BEP-95) The first is the Binance Evolution Proposal (BEP)-95 burning mechanism. Through BEP-95, BNB is burned in real-time by burning a portion of the gas fees spent on BSC. Since the 2021 upgrade of the BNB Smart Chain, BEP-95 has continued to burn around 860 BNB daily. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao implemented BEP-95 to accelerate BNB’s burn rate, which was going slower than planned. By burning part of the gas fees collected by each block’s validators, BEP-95 provides a constant stream of BNB to be burned. BEP-95 is completely reliant on the BSC network, so it will continue to burn BNB after the 100 million burn goal has been reached. BEP-95 burn progress can be tracked via the BNB Burns Tracker Bot on Twitter: Quarterly auto-burn The second method is the scheduled quarterly burns conducted by Binance. In these burns, a specific amount of BNB is bought back from the open market and destroyed. The first burn was conducted in October 2017 and burned 986,000 BNB. The quarterly burns are conducted using Binance’s profits and are announced well in advance. The specific amount of BNB to be burned is based on several factors including overall profitability, BNB circulating supply and the number of blocks produced per quarter. As of the most recent burn in April 2022, a total of 1,839,786.261 BNB have been burned: What is BNB auto-burn? BNB auto-burn was created alongside the launch and rebranding of Binance Chain and Binance Smart Chain into BNB Chain. According to Binance, the auto-burn mechanism was designed to maximize the BNB token’s value and provide a sustainable and safe long-term growth plan for the BNB ecosystem. Binance used to do quarterly BNB burns based on the BNB trading volume on their exchange. However, quarterly burns were replaced by BNB auto-burn in December 2021. The auto-burns are still done quarterly, but they are no longer based solely on the trading volume on Binance.  The BNB auto-burn mechanism is automated to adjust the quantity of BNB that will need to be burned depending on two factors: BNB price Number of blocks generated on BSC per quarter According to Binance, the new BNB burning mechanisms provide better transparency and are more predictable than the previous quarterly burn method. According to the Binance team, the new auto-burn mechanism will help stabilize the BNB price and protect it from large fluctuations. How does BNB auto-burn work? From a technical perspective, BNB auto-burn uses on-chain information from the BNB Smart Chain to calculate how much BNB should be burned. This is how the mechanism “adjusts” the burn amount. The burn amount is also influenced by supply and demand dynamics, which means that when the price of BNB declines, the burn rate increases. As previously mentioned, coin burns  increase a cryptocurrency’s value. BNB auto-burn was designed to remain independent of BNB trading volume on Binance (which used to be its sole basis). This is to assure the BNB community that the process is verifiable, objective and transparent. The goal is to continue running auto-burn until the 100 million mark. It will do so automatically using the formula below: In the equation above, B represents the total amount of BNB to be burned and N represents the number of blocks produced on the BNB Smart Chain during the quarter. The average block time is 3 seconds, setting the approximate value of blocks produced per hour at 1,200 blocks. A standard computation would yield the value of N as approximately 2,592,000 blocks. The value may fluctuate depending on exactly how many days there are per month during a specific quarter. P is for BNB’s average price at the time. The average price fluctuates within a range of 10% to 20% per day, and the median value is determined by taking a sample based on an  accepted oracle provider , such as ChainLink, for BSC. This is typically carried out every 10,000 blocks and takes around 8.3 hours to produce. K is initially set at 1000 and is a constant price anchor. Its value is subject to change and largely depends on BNB Smart Chain’s community. Members can submit a BEP proposal as well as cast a community vote to update this value. BNB quarterly burn The older quarterly burn mechanism was updated to quarterly auto-burns. Auto-burn achieves the same objective but is more efficient and transparent. The chart below shows the anticipated quarterly BNB auto-Burn amount for a variety of BNB average prices: How to check BNB auto-burn history? BNB auto-burn history can be  tracked . The website keeps a record of all previous burns including details of each burn: For example, if we click on the latest burn, Burn #19, we can see the following details: So, how much BNB has been burned till now? To date, the total BNB burned is 35,750,684.88. Per current price data, this is equivalent to $7,866,304,917.03. You can also  follow  real-time values and details about BNB burning events.  When is the next BNB burn? The latest BNB Burn took place on April 19, 2022, destroying 1,830,382 BNB, or $772,363,806, via auto-burn. There is no specific date yet for the 20th burn, but it is expected to happen anytime between July 16-20, 2022.

DappBay is equipped with a novel feature called Red Alarm, which assesses project risk levels in real-time and alerts users of potentially risky decentralized applications (DApps), according to a Thursday announcement. Red Alarm is a contract risk scanning tool offered by DappBay that helps users identify high-risk projects to protect their investments from rug pulls and scams. Users can check if a contract address has logical flaws or fraud risks by entering it into the Red Alarm feature. Gwendolyn Regina, an investment director at BNB Chain, said that DappBay allows the BNB Beacon Chain community to shortlist and rank the best recently launched projects, such as  decentralized finance  (DeFi) and  nonfungible tokens  (NFT), by utilizing market data. She added that: ""Most importantly, the Red Alarm feature helps users in staying one step ahead of scammers; the system warns in real time of potential risks associated with the projects, allowing the community to make informed investment decisions."" DappBay's goal is to aid the community in understanding market trends with the most up-to-date project rankings and anticipating project dangers in real-time. It also has other features that allow DApp developers to list their projects on DappBay.

binance,Business,Coinbase's Market Share Tumbles to Less Than 3%: Mizuho,"Coinbase Global (COIN) continues to lose market share to its global rivals and is at risk of greater losses amid the crypto bear market, Mizuho equity research analyst Dan Dolev said in a note to clients. Dolev estimates Coinbase's average trading volume at roughly $1.2 billion in July, down from nearly $7 billion in November 2021. The company's market share of global trading volume dropped to just 2.9% in July, said Dolev, versus an average of 5.3% in the first quarter of 2022 and a peak of 8-9% in November 2021. According to Dolev, Coinbase ranked 14th in average trading volume by dollars in July, down from fourth last November. Binance continues to be the world's largest exchange by volume, posting an average of nearly $11 billion in trading in July, down from $32.9 billion in November 2021. ""This trend is problematic for COIN,"" said Dolev, as growing exchange competition will require Coinbase to continue raising marketing spend and is likely to weigh on its fee rates.

binance,Business,SEC Hasn’t Subpoenaed Binance About BNB: FOIA Response,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) “probe” into whether  Binance’s BNB token  is a security might just be the commission asking questions, as  Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao has claimed . A Freedom of Information Act request  sent by CoinDesk to the SEC about a “subpoena sent to Binance by the SEC with regards to an investigation into the BNB token” came back with no responsive documents. “Based on the information you provided in your letter, we conducted a thorough search of the SEC’s various systems of records, but did not locate or identify any information responsive to your request,” an SEC FOIA officer wrote in the commission’s response to CoinDesk. This suggests there was no legally binding subpoena that would compel the exchange to produce documents and make personnel available for questioning. A response to a Freedom of Information request put forward to the SEC by CoinDesk (SEC) Bloomberg  reported in June  that “investigators are examining if the 2017 initial coin offering [of BNB] amounted to the sale of a security that should have been registered with the agency.” At CoinDesk’s Consensus 2022 event in June, Zhao said that Binance is in regular contact with authorities about its products and denied that the company had been subpoenaed. Zhao has been a frequent critic of the media, sometimes equating reporting to playing a game of “telephone.” He has  said publicly  that he’d no longer give interviews to news outlets that use “clickbait titles.” BNB is Binance’s exchange token, meaning holders get a discount on Binance’s trading fees, and the utility token behind the Binance (BNB) chain — which  has a market cap of $471 million  and is home to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) projects. While BNB does not confer equity in Binance, its value fluctuates with the perceived success or failures of Binance on the market. Would the SEC admit there’s a BNB investigation? Should there be an active investigation into Binance, the SEC could withhold disclosing documents  under Exemption 7, one of the exemptions available  to it. The exemption prohibits the release of documents compiled for law enforcement purposes that “could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings.” But in order not to tip its hand to the presence of an investigation, the SEC will occasionally answer with a “can neither confirm nor deny” response. After all, a response withholding documents due to the presence of an investigation could be materially damaging to a company even if the investigation came back empty-handed. Hence the need for a “neither confirm nor deny” policy to maintain the confidentiality of investigations. Colloquially, this response is known as a “Glomar,” named after the Howard Hughes-owned ship the CIA  contracted to hunt  for a sunken Soviet submarine. Journalists at the Los Angeles Times didn’t buy the cover story, and pushed under the then-nascent Freedom of Information Act to get more details. They were blocked with a “can neither confirm nor deny” response, not a specific national security exemption, and the  American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued  alleging abuse of the Act. Courts eventually sided with the CIA, and the term “Glomarization”  was born  in the ruling. Do Kwon subpoena got 'glomared' Last September, one of the buzzing topics wasn’t a potential subpoena of Binance, but rather if Terra co-founder Do Kwon was subpoenaed by the SEC while attending Messari’s Mainnet conference. Initially, Kwon denied he had been subpoenaed. But he later backtracked slightly over legal quibbles on whether the service in New York was in fact proper.  In the end , it turned out he was served, and Terra lost an appeal that  contested the validity of service . But, at the time, the  SEC responded to a FOIA  about Kwon’s subpoena with a Glomar response. “We do not mean to imply in any way that records responsive to your request exist,” the SEC wrote at the time. For the response to CoinDesk’s FOIA about an investigation into Binance, the language was more clear: The records don’t exist. As for Terra, it turned out the subpoena would be the least of Kwon’s problems a few months later.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/07/22/sec-hasnt-subpoenaed-binance-about-bnb-foia-response/,coindesk,2022-07-22,06:27:00,en,686,4186,5.071428571428571,294,0.42857142857142855,security exchange commission sec probe binance bnb token security commission question binance ceo changpeng claimed freedom information act request coindesk sec subpoena binance sec investigation bnb token responsive document based information provided letter conducted search sec system record locate identify information responsive request sec foia officer wrote commission response coindesk suggests legally binding subpoena compel exchange produce document make personnel questioning response freedom information request put forward sec coindesk sec bloomberg reported investigator examining initial coin offering bnb amounted security registered agency coindesk consensus event binance regular contact authority product denied company subpoenaed frequent critic medium equating reporting playing game telephone publicly longer give interview news outlet clickbait title bnb binance exchange token meaning holder discount binance trading fee utility token binance bnb chain market cap home variety decentralized finance defi project bnb confer equity binance fluctuates perceived success failure binance market sec admit bnb investigation active investigation binance sec withhold disclosing document exemption exemption exemption prohibits release document compiled enforcement purpose expected interfere enforcement proceeding order tip presence investigation sec occasionally answer confirm deny response response withholding document due presence investigation materially damaging company investigation empty handed confirm deny policy maintain confidentiality investigation colloquially response glomar named owned ship cia contracted sunken soviet submarine journalist los time buy pushed nascent freedom information act detail blocked confirm deny response specific national security exemption american civil liberty union aclu sued alleging abuse act court eventually sided cia term glomarization ruling subpoena glomared buzzing topic potential subpoena binance founder subpoenaed sec attending messari mainnet conference initially denied subpoenaed backtracked slightly legal quibble service fact proper end turned served lost appeal contested validity service time sec responded foia subpoena glomar response imply record responsive request exist sec wrote time response coindesk foia investigation binance language clear record exist turned subpoena problem month,-0.04772727272727274,negative,0.3924825174825174,"{'neg': 0.101, 'neu': 0.758, 'pos': 0.141, 'compound': 0.9216}",0.9216,0.101,0.758,0.141,positive,-0.6842105083102499,0.1366906469903214,negative
binance,Policy,Ex-Coinbase Product Manager Pleads Not Guilty in Crypto Insider Trading Case: Report ,"Former Coinbase (COIN) product manager Ishan Wahi has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of insider trading, according to a  Reuters report on Wednesday . Ishan Wahi is  accused of sharing information  about which crypto assets the exchange would be listing next with his brother Nikhil Wahi and Sameer Ramani prior to the actual listing. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)  also brought charges  against the three tied to the same insider trading allegations. Ishan Wahi allegedly shared information about at least 14 different listings at Coinbase, and the defendants made up to $1.5 million through the scheme, according to the Justice Department, though the SEC put the figure at closer to $1.1 million. This is the second insider trading case involving crypto that the Department of Justice has pursued. The case has also attracted attention because the SEC  named nine tokens as securities  in the proceedings, albeit without charging the issuers or Coinbase for listing them.

binance, Altcoin Watch , BNB rallies 39% despite smart contract deposits dropping 28% — Should investors be worried? ,"Cryptocurrencies’ total market capitalization bounced from $860 billion on June 30 to the current $1.03 trillion, a 20.6% relief in five weeks. Ether ( ETH ) might have been the absolute leader among the largest smart contract chains, but  BNB  managed to gain 39% over that period. BNB (blue) vs. Ether (orange), AVAX (cyan), SOL (yellow). Source: TradingView BNB token’s year-to-date performance remains negative by 43%, but the current $49.5 billion market capitalization ranks it the third largest, excluding stablecoins. Furthermore, the leading decentralized application (DApp) is PancakeSwap — 843,630 active addresses in the past seven days — which runs on BNB Chain. The token serves primarily as a utility asset within the Binance exchange ecosystem, enabling traders to earn discounts or participate in token offers. So, technically, the BNB token does not give ownership rights or dividends to any Binance-owned company or service. However,  according  to Bloomberg, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is investigating whether the initial coin offering (ICO) of BNB tokens in 2017 consisted of a sale of unregistered securities. A digital asset may fall under the SEC’s scrutiny if buyers intend to profit from the efforts of a company or project funded by the capital raise. To understand whether BNB's 39% rally in five weeks is justified, investors should analyze network use, including smart contract deposits, active users and decentralized applications adoption. Mixed data from smart contract deposits and DApp usage BNB Chain‘s primary decentralized application metric started to display weakness earlier in May as the network‘s total value locked (TVL) dropped below 24 million BNB. BNB Chain network Total Value Locked, BNB millions. Source: Defi Llama The chart above shows how BNB Chain‘s DApp deposits saw a 28% decline in three months as the indicator reached its lowest level since April 2021. As a comparison, Ethereum‘s TVL currently stands at 24.4 million ETH, an 11% decline over the same period. Moreover, another DApp competitor, Solana ( SOL ), saw a 2% TVL decrease to 50.2 million SOL. On the bright side, on Aug. 3, the Binance exchange announced the launch of its first-ever token aimed at certifying  verified user status  on the platform.

To confirm whether this drop in TVL should be concerning, one should analyze DApp usage metrics. Some DApps are not financially intensive, so the value deposited is irrelevant.

The above data suggest that BNB Chain’s TVL is losing ground versus competing chains, but investors should not be concerned because DApps activity in the network remains strong.

binance,Business,Binance Says It Will Remove WazirX Off-Chain Transfers Hours After Indian Firm's Founder Says They Were Restarted,"Binance said it will  remove  off-chain transfers between its platform and WazirX just hours after the Indian cryptocurrency exchange's founder, Nischal Shetty, said the service had been reinstated. In a blog post, Binance said it will  halt the transfers  as of 03:00 UTC on Thursday. Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange by volume, and its founder and CEO Changpeng Zhao have been involved in a surprising back and forth with WazirX and its founders. The disagreements started last week after Shetty and Zhao posted opposing views on social media  regarding the ownership of the platform . Last week, Indian authorities  raided  the properties of a WazirX director in connection to an alleged fraud involving crypto. Following the report, Zhao took to Twitter to claim that Binance did not own WazirX, prompting Shetty to fire back and say that it did. Binance  reportedly  stopped off-chain transfers between the exchanges on Sunday. Shetty in an interview with CoinDesk earlier Monday said that the off-chain service had been restarted. ""I'm guessing because a lot of users complained about it to them,"" he said. Zhao also advised WazirX users to move their funds to Binance and that the exchange could shut down WazirX, ""but we can't because it hurts users."" WazirX users flooded the exchange's Telegram channel with concerns about whether their funds were safe and whether the platform's native coin WRX would be delisted by Binance. When asked for comment WazirX only said that ""users can continue to use the on-chain deposits and withdrawals on WazirX.” Binance also said it will support Indian regulators in the ongoing matters concerning WazirX.

binance,Business,Panic Grips WazirX Users After Binance's CEO Advises Users to Move Funds ,"Changpeng Zhao, the founder and CEO of crypto exchange Binance, has stirred panic among users of WazirX. Zhao said Binance could, it it wanted to, shut down the Indian cryptocurrency platform, and has advised its users to transfers their funds to Binance. Zhao was denying claims made by WazirX founder Nischal Shetty that the Indian exchange is owned by Binance  following a probe by Indian government agencies . ""Binance provides wallet services for WazirX. WazirX domain is transferred to our control. We were given a shared access to an AWS account. We could shut down WazirX. But we can't, because it hurts users,"" Zhao tweeted. ""If you have funds on WazirX, you should transfer it to Binance. Simple as that."" Users, in turn, flooded WazirX's Telegram channel asking if this was true, whether their funds were safe and whether the exchange's native coin, WRX, would be delisted by Binance. WRX is down over 12% since Friday currently priced at 25 cents,  according to CoinMarketCap data . ""In light of recent events about WazirX, we wanted to assure you that operations are being conducted as normal,"" WazirX responded on Telegram. WazirX Vice President Rajagopal Menon also tried to quell fears, stating, “We are the only large crypto exchange that allows complete withdrawals of cryptos in India and that shows how solvent we are and how sensible our business model is. Indian rupee (INR) withdrawals are working, and there is no issue in terms of the structural viability of the company. Users crypto is safe.” Twitter spat Zhao's comments came after India's Enforcement Directorate (ED) raided the properties of WazirX director and co-founder Sammer Mhatre on Aug. 5. The properties were raided as part of an investigation over alleged fraud on instant loan apps that the crypto platform ""actively assisted,"" according to ED. India's Ministry of Finance had also said that it was investigating WazirX, alleging the exchange used Binance to disguise transactions. Binance was believed to be the owner of WazirX, but its CEO denied the claim on Twitter. ""Binance does not own any shares in Zanmai Labs, the entity operating WazirX and established by the original founders,"" Zhao said. Referring to a blog post announcing a proposed acquisition in November 2019, Zhao said the deal was never completed. Nischal Shetty, however,  suggested on Twitter  that Zhao was muddying the situation by referring to Zanmai Labs. ""WazirX was acquired by Binance. Zanmai Labs is an India entity owned by me & my co-founders Zanmai Labs has license frm Binance to operate INR-Crypto pairs in WazirX Binance operates crypto to crypto pairs, processes crypto withdrawal,"" he tweeted. He said that Binance owns the WazirX domain name, root access to its servers, all its crypto assets and all profits. ""Don't confuse Zanmai and WazirX,"" he added. Shetty told CoinDesk in an interview that WazirX has the legal documentation in place to prove that Binance owns WazirX. At the time of writing, Binance had not responded to CoinDesk's request for clarification on the matter.

binance,Interview,"After Brutal Q2, Coinbase Needs to ‘Get Smart’ About Revenue Streams: Analyst Says ","Coinbase Global (COIN) will need to reevaluate its approach when it comes to earning revenue, said Michael Safai, a managing partner at trading firm Dexterity Capital. Safai told CoinDesk TV on Wednesday the U.S. crypto exchange’s  lower-than-expected  earnings report does not come as a surprise, but does highlight how the exchange’s business model and overall management style might be falling out of time. “Coinbase is going to have to get smart about how they are going to make revenue numbers in the future,” Safai said on CoinDesk TV’s “ First Mover ” show. On Tuesday, the largest publicly traded crypto company in the U.S. posted a net loss of more than $1 billion for the second quarter amid declining trading volumes and a so-called crypto winter. The exchange missed analysts’ revenue expectations by more than 30%, falling to $803 million. Safai said Coinbase’s overall strategy in the near term needs to be “survive, be smart about spending” and “find new ways to generate revenue.” That could mean its existing business model needs a facelift. Safai suggested the exchange could start charging fees for market data and colocation. Rival exchanges Binance and FTX also support thriving options markets, for instance. Historically, the centralized exchange has derived almost all of its profit from transaction fees and may have inadvertently neglected other sources of revenue, Safai said. That’s not for a lack of trying. Earlier this year, the exchange  launched  a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace in a bid to capture part of that growing market. But its effort was unpopular since launch, and, according to its earnings report, user growth fell from 9.2 million monthly active users to just 9 million this quarter. As part of a wider effort to trim its budget, the exchange said it would be cutting back on its marketing spending. In June of this year,  Coinbase laid off  about 18% of its staff – about 1,100 employees. “It’s still early days, and they need to spend a lot of money getting new users. Cutting your marketing budget, that’s going to make that hard,” Safai said. Other headwinds include a marketwide trend to drop trading fees to zero, lack of interest among retail investors and regulatory uncertainty. Last month the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said nine tokens listed to trade on Coinbase were unregistered securities, as part of an  investigation  into insider trading allegations by a former employee at the firm. Moreover, even though Coinbase appeared to be unaffected by the crypto contagion that spread from  Voyager Digital ,  Three Arrows Capital  and  Celsius Network , those failures still “sucked a lot of leverage and assets out of the ecosystem.” “Retail users, they're spooked by the failures, but they're also kind of seeing less to do [in crypto],” Safai said. “And so this is generally bad news.” Moving forward, Safai said retail investors could become more comfortable as crypto moves toward regulation. He adds that Coinbase acquiring FairX is  a smart move. “By acquiring FairX, Coinbase now has a legit properly licensed futures platform,” he said. “But to do that, you have to invest a lot and they’re doing that, to say the least.” Read more:  SEC Probing Coinbase for Allegedly Listing Securities: Report",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/08/10/after-brutal-q2-coinbase-needs-to-get-smart-about-revenue-streams-analyst-says/,coindesk,2022-08-10,21:52:00,en,536,3281,5.097014925373134,187,0.34888059701492535,coinbase global coin reevaluate approach earning revenue safai managing partner trading firm dexterity capital safai told coindesk tv crypto exchange expected earnings report surprise highlight exchange business model management style falling time coinbase make revenue future safai coindesk tv mover show largest publicly traded crypto company posted net loss amid declining trading volume called crypto exchange missed analyst revenue expectation falling safai coinbase strategy term survive spending find way generate revenue existing business model facelift safai suggested exchange start charging fee market data colocation rival exchange binance ftx support thriving option market instance historically centralized exchange derived profit transaction fee inadvertently neglected source revenue safai lack earlier exchange launched fungible token nft marketplace bid capture part growing market effort unpopular launch earnings report user growth active user part wider effort trim budget exchange cutting marketing spending coinbase laid staff employee day spend lot user cutting marketing budget make hard safai headwind include marketwide trend drop trading fee lack interest retail investor regulatory uncertainty security exchange commission token listed trade coinbase unregistered security part investigation insider trading allegation employee firm coinbase appeared unaffected crypto contagion spread voyager digital arrow capital celsius network failure sucked lot leverage asset ecosystem retail user spooked failure kind crypto safai generally bad news moving forward safai retail investor comfortable crypto move regulation add coinbase acquiring fairx move acquiring fairx coinbase legit properly licensed future platform invest lot sec probing coinbase allegedly listing security report,-0.11284722222222222,negative,0.3677083333333333,"{'neg': 0.143, 'neu': 0.724, 'pos': 0.133, 'compound': -0.1779}",-0.1779,0.143,0.724,0.133,neutral,-0.8823528892733594,0.07589285680404975,negative
binance, Sponsored , Want to share in the success of your favorite artists? Now you can ,"It's an all-too-common problem: artists have brilliant ideas for albums that take them in a new creative direction, but record labels stand in their way.  But now, a blockchain-based music platform is promising to give creatives complete control over their works — all while allowing devoted fans to get involved in the production process. Corite  says it eliminates the need for record labels and managers altogether by enabling artists to secure funding directly from the public integrated with BNB Chain. Musicians can now make key decisions — determining how much they need to raise in order to release an album or a song, with their backers getting a share of the royalties. Making the most of Corite Corite leverages blockchain-based crowdfunding to give artists full control over their content and access to new models of interacting with fans via NFTs. Users can also support the musicians with fiat money, and there is a crypto payment option available. Furthermore, its native token CO will exist as a  BEP-20  token. BEP-20 is a token standard on  BNB Smart Chain . With BNB Chain integration, fans will have access to a variety of trusted and liquid assets provided by the BNB Chain ecosystem. Corite currently supports BNB, BUSD, USDT, and USDC — with BNB Chain offering significantly lower gas fees for users when compared with Ethereum. It's critical to keep transaction costs under control on a platform that runs on contributions from the community, users, and fans of all portfolio sizes. The integration with BNB Chain means fans who make a financial contribution will receive part of the proceeds when songs are streamed on Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube — with the blockchain used to track how frequently songs are played. Corite's concept goes far beyond delivering fairer terms for artists. When fans find a musician they love, they'd often move mountains in order to access special experiences such as backstage passes and signed LPs. Now, they can get closer to their favorite artists by supporting them directly. Gaining momentum A significant milestone for Corite's ambitions came in June, right in the heart of Times Square at the NFT.NYC conference. DJ Alan Walker, who has won praise for his single Faded, kickstarted a promotion to raise $75,000 for his new EP — with his name in lights on a major building. He said he was overwhelmed by the support he had received — and wanted fans ""to own a part of our shared history.""  Backers are going to receive a chunk of Walker's streaming revenues on Spotify for the next five years — and one song, Unity, has already amassed 1.6 million streams on the platform. Crucially, artists are able to decide the terms for any planned revenue shares with their fans. Statistics provided by the project suggest Corite now has more than 80,000 registered users — and artists have now run over 100 fan campaigns since an integration with the BEP-20 standard. There have already been millions of streams too, with the likes of King Charles, Kid Travis, Danny Saucedo and Sabina Ddumba getting involved.  And the success stories seen so far show that this can be a potent business model that turns the music world on its head — democratizing the industry and ensuring that anyone with raw talent can get their songs, albums and careers off the ground. Top tips for artists So… what are the top tips for success if you're an artist who is determined to make it big through Corite? Well, it includes utilizing the freedom that comes from bypassing strict, exploitative contracts with established labels. You should aggressively promote your music on social media — and remind fans that they'll play an instrumental role in your success. It also helps to explain why you're funding upcoming songs and albums, and how it'll be used. Regular updates — and expressing your gratitude — can also go a long way. And it doesn't hurt to create an aura of excitement about an imminent release. Every play on a radio station (and blasting a song loud from the top of a 10-storey building!) can go a long way to gaining momentum… especially if it becomes the soundtrack of a viral TikTok video. Industries come and go, technologies thrive and then become obsolete. But there's one thing that has endured for centuries: music. Through Corite, gifted artists are finding a new way to ensure their voices are heard — without all of the hurdles and common pitfalls that have long been associated with this cutthroat industry.

binance, News ," Pandas, cyborgs, dogs, koalas dominate BNB Chain Red Alarm flag list ","BNB Chain, a blockchain network created by crypto exchange Binance, has identified over 50 on-chain projects that pose a significant risk to users. A mix of crypto spin-offs resembling Dogecoin ( DOGE ) and Binance and others dedicated to pandas, cyborgs and koalas made the list as untrustworthy and high-risk projects. BNB Chain’s Red Alarm feature, implemented to protect investors from potential rug pulls and scams, flags projects based on two main criteria: if the contract performs differently from what the project owners advertised and if the contract shows risks that might influence users’ funds. Speaking to Cointelegraph, Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at BNB Chain, said that the Red Alarm system analyzed 3,300 contracts in July alone, adding that the company continues to develop further measures for highlighting deceptive practices in the ecosystem. New projects that have not been tested and lack genuine products are flagged by the system based on apparent features that have been historically used in scams, rug pulls and phishing. Regina added: “We will tend to put them on the ‘Red Alarm’ list to effectively warn users to steer clear or participate with caution.” As a result, the real-time identification of risky projects serves as a proactive measure in helping to protect investor funds. Red Alarm also allows users to assess project risks by entering the contract address to discover if it has logical flaws or fraud risks.  In addition to BNB Chain’s measures, Regina recommended investors “do their own research” while engaging with projects within the BNB Chain ecosystem.

binance, Altcoin Watch , 3 reasons why Binance Chain (BNB) rallied 66% since the crypto market crashed ,"BNB , the native token of Binance’s BNB Chain , has bounced 66% from its $183 low in mid-June. The move consolidates its position as the third-ranked cryptocurrency (when stablecoin market caps are removed) and reflects a $50 billion market capitalization. BNB has outperformed the broader altcoin market capitalization after a devastating 73% correction that began in November 2021. BNB token at FTX (blue) vs. Total market cap ex-BTC (orange). Source: TradingView The above chart displays how this smart contract blockchain network suffered during the recent market collapse and how similar movements happened across the altcoin market. Now that BNB price has reached $300, let’s take a look at how the asset is positioned compared to July 2021 when it traded for the same price. Is BNB’s market cap and valuation justified? Back in July 2021, the altcoin market capitalization stood 21% higher at $740 billion. Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) had already established themselves as the market leaders, but the dispute for the third position was far from settled, at least in terms of the total value. Top coins by market cap on July 4, 2021. Source: Coinmarketcap Despite still being the third largest cryptocurrency, BNB’s market cap was $47 billion, while Cardano ( ADA ) held a $46 billion valuation. Currently, no altcoin remotely matches its dominance and the gap has widened by more than $30 billion. Smart contracts form the foundation of all decentralized applications (DApps), including decentralized finance, gaming, marketplaces, social networks and many other use cases. So what other success metrics are there besides the number of active users using addresses as a proxy? Top DApps active addresses in 30-days, excluding gambling. Source: DappRadar PancakeSwap, BNB Chain’s decentralized exchange, has 1.98 million active addresses. The number is so massive that aggregating the next four competitors is not enough to match it. According to the data, the runner-up to BNB Chain is 1inch Network, which holds 91% fewer users. For those questioning whether BNB Chain is a one-trick pony, the network holds a couple of games that have 83,000 or more active addresses each and 78,450 that use the 1inch Network. Asking whether PancakeSwap really holds that many users is a valid question, but the Ethereum network only holds three DApps surpassing 30,000 active addresses, namely Uniswap, OpeanSea and MetaMask Swap. Smart contract deposits set BNB Chain apart from its competitors One might argue that the total value of users’ deposits in smart contracts are critical to determining a network’s success. However, while it is highly valid for finance applications, there’s not much reason for marketplaces, games, collectibles and social networks to hold large deposits. Total Value Locked ranking, USD. Source: Defillama Currently, Ethereum is the absolute leader and the DApp hosting the algorithmic-backed DAI stablecoin has $8.25 billion worth of deposits. Still, this is more than justified by Ether’s $208 billion market capitalization, which is over four times higher than BNB with $50 billion. Data shows a consolidated third place for BNB Chain with $5.5 billion in TVL, which is more than double Avalanche ( AVAX ) and Polygon ( MATIC ).  Binance leads in trading volumes When accounting for the BNB’s valuation, especially in comparison to smart contract blockchains, there needs to be a different methodology because the token has additional utility on the Binance exchange. Furthermore, providing discounted trading fees, opportunities at the token sales launchpad and exclusive staking opportunities allow BNB to stand out among its competitors. Related:  Coinbase eyes long-term growth of subscription revenue, NFTs still a focus Website visitors in the past 90 days. Source: Arcane Research Data from SimilarWeb shows Binance had 300 million website visitors in 30 days versus 121 million from Coinbase. Consequently, if FTX Token ( FTT ) holds a $5 billion market cap, BNB should be five times larger solely from  Binance’s utility offer . Therefore, when making a valuation comparison with smart contract platforms, analysts should discount nearly half of BNB’s $50 billion market cap for an equivalent metric. BNB token seems fairly priced due to its third place (when stablecoins are removed) in global market capitalization ranking, its leadership in DApps users, third place status in terms of TVL deposits and absolute dominance of exchange volumes.

binance,Business,"Binance, FTX Among Crypto Players in Hunt to Buy Voyager Digital Assets as Coinbase Backs Out: Sources","CORRECTION (Aug. 25, 2022, 20:40 UTC) –  Updated to correct the dates when bids for Voyager are due and when any resulting auction would take place. The story previously gave the dates as they were before a  revision  Wednesday. Voyager Digital, the lender whose collapse into bankruptcy worsened this year’s crypto market crisis, is attracting takeover interest from some of the biggest players in the space including exchanges Binance and FTX, according to people familiar with the matter. U.S.-based exchange Coinbase (COIN) evaluated a deal but withdrew, one person said. Bids for Voyager assets are due Sept. 6 in a sale process taking place through its bankruptcy case. An auction, if needed to pick a winner, would follow on Sept. 29. Voyager Digital's native coin voyager (VGX) surged more than 40% after CoinDesk reported the story, according to  CoinMarketCap . According to a  presentation  from the company’s lawyers earlier this month, at least 22 investors had gone through due diligence and indicated their interest in bidding for Voyager’s assets, so Binance, FTX and Coinbase are likely not the only suitors. Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, is keen to purchase Voyager, according to industry sources who have learned of the company’s interest. “Binance is excited and pursuing hard,” one of the people said. The exchange is “pushing hard on buying into institutional,” a second person said. “We have a policy to only disclose deals after they are complete and cannot confirm or deny any potential deals,” a Binance spokesperson said. In  an interview with the New York Times  published last week, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said Voyager – as well as Celsius Network, another crypto lender in bankruptcy – had approached his company to discuss selling assets. “Our team’s engaging in all of those conversations,” he said in the interview.

Coinbase’s involvement was in the form of a potential partnership with Callaway Capital Management, a Washington, D.C.-based firm that specializes in distressed assets. Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, evaluated a possible restructuring plan for Voyager but backed out after concluding “the financials don’t add up,” according to a person with direct knowledge of the company’s thinking. A Coinbase spokesperson declined to comment. Callaway didn’t respond to requests for comment by press time. Moelis, Voyager’s investment bank, declined to comment.

Voyager halted withdrawals and then filed for bankruptcy.

binance,Opinion,What to Make of the Avalanche Whistleblower Report,"Ava Labs, the crypto development group behind the Avalanche blockchain and AVAX token, is under fire after a supposed investigative report showed how the firm allegedly staged a series of class-action lawsuits to attack competitors. On Aug. 26, so-described whistleblower site Crypto Leaks  posted  a lengthy expose that claims Ava Labs paid crypto-focused law firm Freedman Roche in tokens and equity to file this adversarial litigation. Ava CEO Emin Gün Sirer has called the allegations  “categorically false.” This article is excerpted from The Node, CoinDesk's daily roundup of the most pivotal stories in blockchain and crypto news. You can subscribe to get the full  newsletter here . The post includes short, surreptitiously recorded videos of the law firm’s founder, Kyle Roche, describing how he used the U.S. legal system to draw regulatory attention like a “magnet” against alternative layer 1 blockchains including Solana and Dfinity and protect Avalanche’s interests. He also discussed his close professional and personal relationships with Ava and its founders, as well as his financial stake in Avalanche. The report, if true, is damning and shows that anti-competitive behavior is alive and well in crypto. There are, however, several reasons to remain skeptical about the allegations. Right now, the pursuit of truth has reached a he-said-she-said stage – where it seems like all parties are withholding some facts – that only tarnishes crypto’s reputation. The central claims of the investigation cannot be disproven by a third party – that Ava weaponized the legal system may well be true – and need further verification. But some aspects of the report show clear bias. Whether you think that reduces the reporting to mudslinging is up to you, but there are clear factual problems. When judging the veracity or authenticity of something, small facts matter. I think it’s significant that Crypto Leak’s investigation had to be updated to reflect that Gün Sirer, a former Cornell professor, had left the university. This was announced publicly months ago, when the computer scientist decided to go full time on his private ventures. See also:  The Educator-Entrepreneurs of Crypto That update further alleges that Gün Sirer possibly left under nefarious circumstances, which is unsubstantiated. This matters because the whistleblower is building a profile of Gün Sirer who was supposedly bitter for not achieving tenure, suffered from “Satoshi envy” and … is possibly “a sociopath.” You cannot fault a whistleblower for dramatics. But instead of leaning on the actual spy-cam footage, it brings in circumstantial evidence that only undermines its believability. The reporter thinks it’s significant that Roche has failed to update his LinkedIn page to reflect he’s living in Miami – possibly as a tax dodge – or that he works with Ava Labs. Small examples of motivated reasoning add up, and should cast a shadow of doubt. However, for this same reason, you have to be skeptical of Ava’s immediate defense – which hangs on the investigation being funded by rival blockchain project Dfinity. (Roche Freedman has  sued  a Dfinity linked organization for “securities violations” and insider trading.) There’s circumstantial evidence that suggests a relationship exists between “The Internet Computer” and Crypto Leaks, including that its previous reports were defenses of Dfinity against Solana and the New York Times, but there are no clear financial flows. It’s also significant that in their responses to the investigation, Ava Labs, Emin Gün Sirer and Roche have yet to acknowledge Ava’s support of Roche’s “tokenized litigation” platform Ryval – which undercuts claims that Ava only worked with the law firm in its early days. The platform was designed to cryptofy lawsuits, allowing people to invest in the outcome of cases, and was publicly  supported  by Ava Labs in late 2020. We’re left with a series of highly edited videos, filmed by an unknown party and acquired through unknown means, showing a lawyer making braggadocious claims about his practice and peer group. We have a lawyer who claims to have been  deceived and “intoxicated”  by a Norwegian venture capitalist and crypto founder that is downplaying his relationship to his lawyer. Both Roche and Emin Gün Sirer have stated Ava Labs had no insight into Roche’s “plaintiff side practice,” which doesn’t entirely waive away the possibility they were more closely related than they claim. But you have to ask what benefit would it bring for Ava or Roche to sue Binance, or other crypto exchanges like Coinbase (COIN) and Kraken, as planned? See also:  Binance.US Accused of Misleading Investors in Class-Action Roche’s words speak for themselves. He sued “for sport” and for insider information, a fact that only came to light after loose-lipped talking. And his career is likely finished, his reputation burned for getting himself in this mess. He cannot deny appearing on film, over multiple days, even if he was duped into speaking under false pretenses. Then there’s the question of strategy: Did Ava actually think it could benefit ultimately by getting regulators to investigate their rivals for securities violations, despite basically running the same token game? The situation suggests self-cannibalization across-the-board, including the probability that Dfinity is funding mudslinging against its rivals. Of course, this is all really just speculation based on speculation. Of course, lawyers do not always put their client’s interests first. And of course, crypto projects do not always act with honor and distinction. No claims in this sordid little drama seem out of the question.

binance,Policy,"US Congressman Wants Consumer-Protection Answers From Agencies, Crypto Firms","U.S. agencies and major crypto firms such as  Binance.US  and Coinbase Global (COIN) are being questioned about the cryptocurrency industry’s ability to protect consumers, receiving written requests from a senior congressman on the oversight committee of the House of Representatives. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, wrote on Tuesday to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and the heads of three regulatory agencies, in addition to sending similar letters to the CEOs of the crypto companies – also including FTX, Kraken and KuCoin. He  raised several questions  about how investors are being shielded from harm in a sector he argued is running rampant with scams. “Given the growing popularity of cryptocurrencies both as a form of payment and as an investment, I am concerned by the rapid growth of fraud and consumer abuse,” he wrote in the letters. He asked Yellen and the others, which included the chiefs of the Securities and Exchange Commission, Commodity Futures Trading Commission and Federal Trade Commission, what efforts they’re making to limit fraud and criminality. While his correspondence reminded the recipients that the House committee “has broad authority to investigate ‘any matter’ at ‘any time,’” it’s late in this congressional session for a new series of investigative hearings, and the Democrats may not retain control of the House after the midterm elections in November.

binance,Opinion,The Perverse Impacts of the Anti-Money-Laundering System,"In September 2020, Buzzfeed News and a coalition of other investigators dropped a bombshell on the world of international finance and law enforcement. A leaked set of documents from the U.S. Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, showed a disturbing pattern of lax enforcement. When banks reported suspected money laundering to the very agency tasked with monitoring ill-gotten criminal funds, quite often, the authorities did nothing about it at all. This was at least a threefold failure. First and most obviously, transactions flagged by banks in Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) to FinCEN weren’t actually being stopped. Second, filing the reports shielded the banks themselves from legal liability, allowing them to continue facilitating criminal transactions (and collecting fees on them). This op-ed is part of CoinDesk's  Sin Week . This buck-passing two-step led to absurdities like HSBC (HSBC) moving money for the already-sanctioned  WCM777 Ponzi scheme , and Standard Chartered (SCBFF) and Deutsche Bank (DB) indirectly  facilitating transactions for the Taliban , all while reporting the transactions as clearly suspicious. As Buzzfeed concluded at the time, it seemed that “laws that were meant to stop financial crime have instead allowed it to flourish.” Less attention was given to the third failing of FinCEN’s SAR system: It compromised the privacy and security of banking customers who had done nothing wrong. Former FBI special agent Michael German at the time described FinCEN’s trove of SARs to Buzzfeed as similar to the huge  “data hoards”  created by other forms of mass surveillance. They create a rich target for exactly the sort of exfiltration that wound up happening. Much of the data that became the FinCEN files was initially requested by Congress as part of its investigation of potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. It included troves of data about entirely innocent customers, which Buzzfeed and other news organizations carefully redacted. But had the same data fallen into less responsible hands the fallout might have been catastrophic. The FinCEN files, taken as a whole, revealed the SAR system to be substantially a kind of theatrical performance – one with a steep production budget. “A pretty sound estimate is that the financial surveillance regime we’ve got costs tens of billions of dollars annually globally. And it might be in the high tens of billions,” says Jim Harper, a privacy advocate and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank. With that budget, banks were pretending to monitor suspicious financial transactions, and enforcement agencies were pretending to control them. This bit of Kabuki invaded the privacy of innocent customers and threatened the banking relationships of legitimate businesses, while drug lords and oligarchs continued doing business. The entire system may be less a tool for crime prevention than a means of bureaucratic ass covering, with a rich dollop of authoritarian surveillance on top. The big risks of 'de-risking' In theory, anti-money laundering (AML) measures are meant to identify and stop the global movement of funds either earned through criminal activity or intended to fund bad actors. The big-picture goal is to increase human happiness by strangling the bad guys’ finances. Those efforts extend into the realm of cryptocurrency – anti-money laundering measures are why you probably had to provide personal identification, or “know your customer” information, when you signed up to use the Coinbase (COIN) or Binance crypto exchanges. That requirement illustrates one of the big trade-offs of the current surveillance-heavy AML model. Like FinCEN’s trove of SARs but on an even larger scale, KYC data imposes security risks on law-abiding citizens. In early 2021, for example, a trove of KYC data was hacked from Indian payment app  MobiKwik . But there are deeper, more systemic costs to the current status quo in anti-money laundering efforts. And they fall most heavily on some of the most marginalized and powerless people on Earth. The entire system may be less a tool for crime prevention, than a means of bureaucratic ass covering. “It drives up the price of banking across the board,” Jim Harper says. “So the person who feels they can no longer afford a banking account, that’s because of the surveillance that makes it much more expensive.” While AML requirements may not be the only factor, there’s no denying the rising costs and declining services of conventional banking in recent years, which Lisa Servon documented in her excellent 2017 book  “The Unbanking of America.” Another major concern has been the threat of tighter regulation to global trade and developing countries. Stricter sanction regimes and higher fines for violations after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks and the 2008 financial crisis appear to have contributed to American banks severing international relationships, a process broadly referred to as “de-risking.” The main culprit here is the set of national blacklists maintained by the global Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Those lists have grown more rapidly in recent years, with noticeable impacts. “You saw a massive contraction in [international] correspondent banking relationships,” says Matt Collin, a global development specialist who works with the Brookings Institution and the World Bank. For banks in the developing world, losing banking connections to major economies can seriously hamper a local economy’s ability to, for instance, keep stable import/export relationships. Read more: David Z. Morris -  In Defense of Crime “These [rules] are in general likely to be regressive,” says Collin. In other words, they fall heavily on countries, banks and other entities with fewer resources and less influence over the system itself. “Even if everyone involved is clean, the due diligence is a struggle.” More to the point, much like the flood of SARs to FinCEN, the de-risking process is more about meeting particular processes and controls than it is about targeting the actual problem of illicit finance. “Regulators think we need to make sure every country has a similar set of standards,” says Collin. “As an economist, I think you want to go after countries that are hosting a lot of illicit finance. And if you look at where the money ends up, it’s countries that actually have good standards.” Specifically, Collin is referring to the United States – now the  top global destination for laundered funds . “But those countries don’t end up on the [FATF] blacklist,” Collin laments. “ Small African countries end up on the list.” Does AML actually work? These risks and barriers could be considered trade-offs for a financial system that restricts criminal activity. But the shocking truth is that we have almost no insight into what exactly we’re getting in return. “The idea that cracking down on money laundering and tax evasion should eliminate the incentive to commit the predicate crime is a fundamental pillar to this system,” says Matt Collin. “And it’s the most untested part of the theory of change behind the whole apparatus.” In other words, we have very little solid evidence that harsher anti-money laundering rules reduce the volume of drug trafficking or other major crime. Collin says he is unaware of a single economic study clearly showing a reduction of crime following new AML rules (though he admits such a study might be difficult to design). One specific example of unclear results is FinCEN’s  Geographic Targeting Order  for residential real estate. This rule requires sellers to identify the individual person behind all-cash real estate purchases, which are often leveraged for money laundering, tax evasion or capital flight. “You expect to see a decline in those transactions after that increase of transparency,” says Collin. “And we’ve found no evidence that that changed.” There is a silver lining, of a sort. While there may or may not be an impact on old-fashioned crime, Collin says recent pushes for more transparency for former tax havens has reduced the amount of tax evasion around the world. “There’s a pretty large decline in deposits in tax havens, so people are responding to it.” Money laundering to the highest bidder? Don’t spend too many tears for the wealthy, though. While tax evasion may be getting tougher, money still talks when it comes to AML oversight. The influence of the wealthy and powerful over the system is sometimes subtle and indirect. For instance, Collin believes the weak results of some current AML efforts are not so much problems with the policies themselves as with their lax and underfunded implementation, both by governments and banks. Various sorts of information provided to enforcement agencies by banks or real estate titling companies is frequently simply fraudulent and, according to Collin, “FinCEN [and other agencies] just don’t have the ability to verify that that information [in reports] is fully correct.” These deceptions aren’t even subtle: “Lots of companies [in reports] are owned by Jesus Christ and other stuff that seems to have been put in as a joke,” Collin says. The underfunding of financial oversight bodies is chronic in the U.S., and that tends to benefit those with big money. Before the Biden administration’s recent injection of funding, the Internal Revenue Service had been warning for years that it was  severely underfunded . Among other effects, this underfunding led to  a decline in audits  for the very wealthy, who often use complex maneuvers to reduce their tax burden. Similarly, a new real estate ownership registry that would expand FinCEN’s existing order has missed its deployment deadline because Congress  did not fully fund the project . A truly suspicious mind might wonder who benefits from choking off funding for financial crimes enforcement. U.S. legislators, after all, remain heavily dependent on financial support from large corporations and wealthy individuals. Some government officials, including former Trump administration Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross,  have been directly damaged  by leaks of financial information. Money has its privileges in other ways, too. Collin says recent research has shown that AML measures may have had less impact on correspondent banking relationships than the declining profitability of specific relationships – but again, the cost of AML compliance is itself contributing to rising costs. Money plays an even bigger role in how much scrutiny banks subject individual customers do. “It’s easier to look the other way when it’s a Russian oligarch who’s going to bring you millions of dollars,” says Collin. “It’s harder to look the other way when it’s a small business who won’t bring that much.” Can we fix it? In some sense, this isn’t news. Financial privacy of any sort has long been much more accessible to the wealthy than to average people. But it’s particularly bitter that AML measures have made profitability and wealth a greater factor in who has access to global banking – including when there really is suspicious activity. But fixing any of this presents a pernicious political double-bind. As noted, legislators’ wealthy financial backers might not particularly want the AML system to be entirely effective. But banks and legislators alike are highly motivated to create the appearance of strong enforcement, which winds up falling disproportionately on smaller fish. At the same time, according to AEI’s Harper, any reforms that might decrease financial surveillance and control are nearly verboten among politicians. He points particularly to the current  $10,000 threshold  for reporting cash transactions to the IRS. In its current form, the requirement is incredibly broad, explicitly including any landlord who receives more than $10,000 in cash payments from a tenant in the course of a year, or a car dealer who sells a car for more than $10,000 in cash. Read more:  How to Pay for Porn With Crypto But the requirement has become so burdensome and absurd only after decades of legislative inaction. “It was set at $10,000 in 1972,” Harper notes. “The equivalent now is something like $70,000 or $80,000 dollars [due to inflation]. Maybe people moving that much cash a long time ago was inherently suspicious … I don’t agree, but I can at least see the argument.” “But $10,000? Unfortunately, I have to give that to contractors all the time.” Correcting this drift, Harper says, has been a political nonstarter because it threatens the entire premise of heightened financial surveillance. “If you open that discussion, you have to open the rest of the discussion.” And banks, despite shouldering added costs, have no leverage to push for cutting red tape because it would make them seem even softer on money launderers than they already (apparently) are. There are efforts to study the real impact of AML measures, under the banner of “effective AML.” Technological innovation may also play a role in breaking the deadlock: A startup called Consilient is developing machine learning-based AML tools for banks similar to what credit card companies deploy to catch fraud. Crucially, their “federated” data model would reduce the sharing of customer information outside of banks, potentially making it both more private and more effective than the manual, outdated SAR system. And, of course, there’s a final technological option: an exit from the traditional financial system through cryptocurrency or similar systems. As FinCEN’s recent move against mixer  Tornado Cash  showed, that opportunity is narrowing, and the practical necessity for real decentralization is growing. It’s genuinely unclear whether crypto can get there before anti-money laundering efforts with unclear benefits devolve into a quest for complete repressive control. Harper fears that such a locked-down system would inflict serious social harms. “Complete financial surveillance would create a truly controlled society that would be  highly law abiding ,” Harper says. “But it would not be a virtuous society.”",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/sinweek/2022/08/31/the-perverse-impacts-of-the-anti-money-laundering-system/,coindesk,2022-08-31,14:42:00,en,2229,14121,5.325257963212203,854,0.38313144908030505,buzzfeed

binance,Business,"Binance, Issuer of Third-Biggest Stablecoin, to Stop Supporting Larger Rival USDC","Binance, the world's largest cryptocurrency exchange by volume, has shaken up the vital stablecoin market, announcing it will automatically move customers' funds to its Binance USD ( BUSD ) stablecoin from alternatives, including the larger USD coin ( USDC ). Binance  said  on Monday that it will convert all investments in USDC, pax dollar ( USDP ) and trueUSD ( TUSD ) into BUSD on Sept. 29, and customers transferring those tokens to the exchange will see them automatically converted into Binance's stablecoin after that date. However, customers will be able to withdraw money denominated in USDC, USDP or TUSD when removing money from Binance. The decision effectively banishes the second-largest stablecoin, USDC, from one of the most prominent perches in crypto, erecting an obstacle to overtaking tether (USDT) as the  biggest one . USDT's $68 billion market value leads USDC's $52 billion, while BUSD is in third place at $19 billion. USDP and TUSD are far smaller. Read more:  What's the Point of Stablecoins? Understanding Why They Exist The surprise move comes as Binance goes after another exchange rival, Coinbase (COIN), by undercutting it on price. Stablecoins  are part of the crypto market's foundation, serving as digital substitutes for the U.S. dollar or other fiat currencies. ""Stable"" comes from the fact that their price is pegged to a conventional currency or other type of asset such as gold. Each token tied to the dollar, for instance, is always supposed to fetch almost exactly $1, though the quality of the assets backing a stablecoin can influence  how far the price strays . The business is dominated by USDT's 44% market share.

binance,Opinion,A Stablecoin Law May Not Happen This Year,"Hey folks. Monday was a federal holiday in the U.S. so we’re taking it easy today. Reporting from my colleague Jesse Hamilton suggests that stablecoin legislation we expected to see released this month may not be coming after all. Plus, a few other stories that caught my eye over the past week. You’re reading State of Crypto, a CoinDesk newsletter looking at the intersection of cryptocurrency and government.  Click here  to sign up for future editions. A Stablecoin Bill is on Deck, But Expect Delays The narrative One of the few pieces of crypto-specific legislation we expected to see in 2022 was a stablecoin bill. It’s looking like this bill may no longer be ready in time for lawmakers to debate and vote into law this year. Why it matters Stablecoins might be the area in which we are most likely to see actual laws, as far as crypto regulation goes. Any possible bill is likely going to address issues such as how stablecoin issuers can tap banking services, what their reserves must look like, whether they can engage in fractional reserves, what sort of licensing stablecoin issuers need and what kind of consumer protections must be baked in. Breaking it down My colleague and Reg Team Deputy Managing Editor Jesse Hamilton reported late last week that the House Financial Services Committee’s (FSC) anticipated stablecoin bill may not actually be introduced, let alone passed, ahead of November’s midterm elections. From his  article : “A legislative push toward the crypto industry’s first significant set of U.S. regulations remains bogged down over negotiations between the panel’s Democratic chairwoman and its ranking Republican, despite initial plans that aimed to release a draft of the bill as early as this week, according to three people familiar with the talks. There have been a number of points to iron out, including such thorny topics as the role of state regulators, the possibility of a future digital dollar in the U.S. and the treatment of customer money held by crypto platforms.” That being said, the bill isn’t dead. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), who chairs the committee, and Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who is the ranking member, are the lead negotiators on this effort, and they’re both coming back in the new year (though it’s possible their titles will be swapped). Of course, as I was writing this the new FSC hearing schedule for September came out, saying there may, in fact, be a markup for stablecoin legislation sometime this month, though “date and time TBD,” so all is not yet lost. Stablecoins have always gotten a fair amount of interest, but as a regulatory issue this seems to continue to be the area lawmakers will tackle before getting to other issues such as whether a law is needed to treat crypto trading platforms similarly to national securities exchanges. The problem is, timing-wise anyway, that the House is only one body. A bill needs to be passed by both the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to become a law, meaning every minute counts. Right now  Sen. Pat Toomey  (R-Pa.), the ranking member in the Senate Banking Committee, is at a guess the most likely lawmaker in the upper house to introduce a similar bill – if the House passes, or at least advances, the Waters-McHenry effort. He’s also retiring from public office after this year, to be replaced either by current Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor John Fetterman or former cardiothoracic surgeon and TV personality Mehmet Oz. I’m not sure who might succeed Toomey as ranking member, but this bill is likely going to take some time to get through the Senate regardless. Other items In other stablecoin news,  Binance  is delisting USD coin (USDC), the Paxos dollar (USDP) and trueUSD (TUSD). It’s going to convert customers’ holdings in those stablecoins into its own branded Binance dollar (BUSD) (which is also issued by Paxos) on a 1:1 basis at the end of the month. A  Voyager  creditor filed Monday asking a court to require the crypto lender to either refund him $10,000 or revert a 10,000 USDC buy order made minutes after the company claimed it suspended all buys and withdrawals. According to Shaik Taj Baba, he placed an order for 10,000 USDC at 2:07 p.m. ET on July 1, and placed a withdrawal order at 2:09 p.m. ET. Voyager processed the buy order, did not process the withdrawal order and announced shortly after that it had halted all activity at 2:00 p.m. Biden’s rule Changing of the guard Key: (nom.) = nominee, (rum.) = rumored, (act.) = acting, (inc.) = incumbent (no replacement anticipated) I’m actually kind of curious if U.S. President Joe Biden can even nominate someone to fill one of the acting roles before the congressional term ends, given the upcoming elections.

binance,Markets,Crypto Terra Luna Classic Surges as Traders Speculate on New Supply Burn Rule,"Luna classic (LUNC), the renamed native token of the Terra blockchain that dramatically imploded in May, is rising in value as traders bet that a soon-to-be implemented rule may breathe some life into the much-maligned token. LUNC gained 22% in the past 24 hours, and doubled its price in a week, according to  data  by crypto intelligence platform Messari. Still, the token is changing hands at a fraction of a cent ($0.00052 to be precise) and it is down more than 99.99% since the start of the year. The price of Terra Classic's LUNC token almost doubled in a week in a speculative frenzy. (TradingView) A “tax burn” regime that aims to reduce the token’s hyperinflated supply is likely fueling the rally. The community approved a  proposal  that introduces a 1.2% tax rate on every transaction on the blockchain. According to the proposal, the “tax” will automatically be sent to a wallet to destroy (burn) the tokens to bring down gradually LUNC’s bloated circulating supply. The fee rate is expected to take effect on Sept. 20, according to a  statement  from Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume. The rate cannot be enforced on trading the token on  centralized exchanges , as a member of the Terra governance forum  pointed out , but some exchanges such as MEXC will voluntarily  adopt the fee . Binance also  announced  Thursday that it will add LUNC trading against Tether's  USDT  to its trading pair list, starting Friday. However, the price rise may prove to be short-lived as the new fee parameter is unlikely to attract new investors to the blockchain, according to Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “It still remains a tough period for crypto in general and investors still have a bad Terra taste in their mouth from the collapse earlier in the year,” he told CoinDesk. Howard Greenberg, cryptocurrency educator at Prosper Trading Academy, said that “this is a total speculation play and basically turns LUNC into a meme coin at this point.” “It will be a very volatile trade, and if someone chooses to enter the trade I would make sure you have an exit plan for both downside and upside.” The Terra blockchain’s  multibillion-dollar implosion  in May was the epicenter of the current crypto crisis and led to the insolvency of multiple crypto lenders and investment firms. The network’s  algorithmic stablecoin , terraUSD (formerly  UST ), lost its peg to the dollar, and sent LUNC (formerly LUNA), which was supposed to stabilize the stablecoin, into hyperinflation. The current supply of LUNC is nearly 7 trillion tokens, and even taking into account the new burn it won’t significantly change the coin’s fundamentals. Most developers and investors have left the network. Those who decided to stay created a duplicate of the Terra blockchain as part of an attempt to have a fresh start for the ecosystem. The old blockchain still remained functional and was rebranded to Terra Classic, hosting the stablecoin USTC and its sister token LUNC.

binance,Markets,"Crypto Exchange Binance to Benefit From Increased Supply of Its Own Stablecoin, BofA Says ","Crypto exchange Binance’s decision to convert all existing balances and future deposits of three stablecoins USD coin (USDC), trueUSD (TUSD) and pax dollar (USDP) into its native binance USD (BUSD) may generate limited additional revenue in the short term, but could have larger implications longer term, Bank of America (BAC) said in a research report Thursday. The automatic conversion may increase the supply of BUSD by as much as $908 million, as 2% ($898 million) of USDC’s supply and 1% ($10 million) of USDP’s supply are held on Binance, the report said. Stablecoins  are a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold. Read more:  Binance, Issuer of Third-Biggest Stablecoin, to Stop Supporting Larger Rival USDC  The bank notes that 86%, or $17 billion, of BUSD is held on Binance, which shows that the stablecoin isn't being used regularly throughout the wider crypto ecosystem and therefore, lacks utility, analysts led by Alkesh Shah wrote. Bank of America sees the potential for a larger increase in BUSD supply over the longer term as exchange users become more familiar with the coin and as applications across add more support for it in an attempt to attract users. Binance will benefit from this increasing supply because it’s able to invest the additional reserves that will back the stablecoin in cash equivalents such as U.S. Treasurys and overnight loans secured by Treasurys to earn interest income. The implications for USDC are limited, but there is the potential for the stablecoin to increase its market share relative to tether (USDT), the largest stablecoin by market cap, which was excluded from the automatic conversion, because exchange users may be more likely to convert BUSD into USDC than into USDT when withdrawing funds. There will likely be a significant increase in stablecoin volumes as the “Web3 ecosystem of decentralized applications develops,” the note added.

binance,Business,Crypto Giant FTX Eyes Raising Money to Fund Acquisitions: Source,"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is raising capital in parallel with a potential acquisition, according to a person familiar with the matter. It’s evaluating several possible takeover candidates, some of which are companies operating retail-trading platforms, the person said. Negotiations are in preliminary stages. If acquisition talks fall through, it’s less likely FTX will raise money, according to the person. FTX is seeking the same  $32 billion valuation  it was assigned the last time it raised money early this year if it does a capital raise, the person said. That stands out given the subsequent rout in crypto prices; FTX rival Coinbase (COIN) has seen its stock plummet about 70% this year. A spokesperson for FTX declined to comment.  FTX.US  President Brett Harrison has previously  said  the exchange was on the lookout for potential acquisitions. FTX co-founder and CEO Sam Bankman-Fried already has a tie to retail trading, personally  purchasing  a 7.6% stake in Robinhood (HOOD), the brokerage.  Robinhood's stock price  rose to the highs of the day after the CoinDesk story was published. A takeover of a company focused on retail investors would likely bring an influx of new users to FTX, which has mostly served sophisticated traders and professionals.

binance, Altcoin Watch , Here’s why BNB will face an important price test on Sept. 30 ,"BNB , the native token of Binance’s BNB Chain, entered a symmetrical triangle formation on Aug. 10, when it first faced the descending trendline at the $335 resistance. The following five weeks have been a struggle around $280, the exact intersection between the two conflicting ascending and descending patterns. BNB token/USD at FTX. Source: TradingView A decision on whether the symmetrical triangle will break to the upside or downside is expected by Sept. 30, when the trendlines cross. Currently holding a $45 billion total market capitalization, BNB has outperformed the broader altcoin market by 15% over the past three months. The latest breakthrough in BNB Chain development was announced on Sept. 7, after the project introduced  zero-knowledge (ZK) proof  scaling privacy technology. The testnet is expected for November, aiming for faster finality and reduced transaction fees. Ethereum mastermind  Vitalik Buterin also wants to implement  a similar solution for the Ethereum network, and he highlighted the importance of ZK in late 2021. BNB Chain’s Ethereum-compatible network is fully functional, hosting  decentralized applications (DApps) , including decentralized exchanges (DEXs), games, collateralized loan services, social networks, yield aggregators and nonfungible token (NFT) marketplaces. A decline in price deposits could be a red flag Despite currently being 60% below its -time high, BNB remains the third largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization ranking, excluding stablecoins. Moreover, the network holds $6.6 billion worth of deposits locked on smart contracts, a term known as total value locked, in the industry. Despite BNB price rallying 26.5% in the past three months, the network’s total value locked (TVL) measured in BNB tokens dropped by 12.5% in the same period. Usually, this data would be concerning, but it depends on how other competitors have fared. BNB Chain Total Value Locked, BNB. Source: DefiLlama In fact, lower smart contract deposits have been the norm across the industry. For example, Solana’s ( SOL ) TVL declined by 27.5% in three months, and Avalanche ( AVAX ) decreased by 36%. Even Ethereum saw a 29% cut in Ether ( ETH ) deposits, down to 24.2 million from 34 million on July 17. In dollar terms, BNB Chain’s current TVL of $6.6 billion gained 12% in the three months leading to Sept. 16. This figure is vastly superior to other Ethereum competitors, such as Avalanche’s $2.2 billion or Solana’s $1.3 billion,  according  to data from DefiLlama. DApp use is on the rise, led by Gameta To confirm whether BNB Chain’s TVL decline is accompanied by a reduction in users, investors should analyze DApp usage metrics. Some DApps, such as games and collectibles, do not require large deposits, so the TVL metric is irrelevant in those cases. Top BNB Chain DApps by active addresses in 30-days. Source: DappRadar PancakeSwap, BNB Chain’s DEX, has 1.75 million active addresses and is the absolute leader across all smart contract networks. Meanwhile, the Ethereum network only holds three DApps with more than 35,000 active addresses, namely Uniswap, OpeanSea and MetaMask Swap. More importantly, three DApps using BNB Chain grew by 190% or higher, with Gameta being the most promising, with over 900,000 active addresses. BNB Chain critics will have a hard time if another application besides PancakeSwap consolidates its leadership across all smart contract networks. Judging by the absolute numbers, meaning the 12.5% TVL decline in BNB tokens and the 14% reduction in active addresses on BNB Chain’s leading DApp, one could incorrectly conclude that BNB is primed for a correction.  However, a more granular analysis, including a comparison with competitors, shows that the symmetrical triangle pattern crossing at $280 on Sept. 30 is likely a bullish trigger for BNB’s price.

binance,Business,NFT Marketplace TravelX Launches With Tickets From Low-Cost Argentinian Airline Flybondi,"TravelX, a marketplace for tokenized travel products, went live on Wednesday with the offering of inventory of the low-cost Argentine airline Flybondi. The platform currently offers 2.5 million tickets, which are tokenized when purchased and converted into non-fungible tokens called NFTickets, TravelX Chief Blockchain Officer Facundo Martin Diaz told CoinDesk. After acquiring an NFTicket, a customer can auction, sell, transfer, gift or exchange them through a peer-to-peer system on TravelX, Diaz said. To purchase tickets on the platform, users can fund the TravelX wallet — which also serves to manage the NFTickets — or pay via Binance Pay. Diaz added that the company is in talks to integrate other exchanges. TravelX is built on the Algorand blockchain and made its infrastructure open so that other companies – such as exchanges or marketplaces – can use TravelX's APIs to create their own marketplaces. Within six to 12 months, the platform hopes to incorporate the inventory of more than 60 airlines, with a special focus on Latin American and European operators. In 2023, Diaz said the company will focus more on the U.S. and Middle East. In November, the company closed a $11 million seed round led by Borderless Capital, said Diaz, who added that it plans to raise a Series A funding round early 2023. The company has 85 employees. TravelX was founded by Diaz and Juan Pablo Lafosse, who previously founded  Almundo.com , a tourism marketplace sold to CVC Corporation for $75 million in 2019. As of now, the platform allows transactions using the USDC stablecoin and has no plans to incorporate other stablecoins, although it could eventually integrate coins developed by airlines, Diaz added. TravelX charges no fee when a user purchases a ticket on the platform, but it does receive 2% when a transaction is made on the platform's peer-to-peer secondary market, while airlines keep another 2%, Diaz said.",https://www.coindesk.com/business/2022/09/22/nft-marketplace-travelx-launches-with-tickets-from-low-cost-argentinian-airline-flybondi/,coindesk,2022-09-22,21:49:00,en,311,1921,5.176848874598071,117,0.3762057877813505,travelx marketplace tokenized travel product live offering inventory cost argentine airline flybondi platform offer ticket tokenized purchased converted fungible token called nftickets travelx chief blockchain officer facundo told coindesk acquiring nfticket customer auction transfer gift exchange peer peer system travelx purchase ticket platform user fund travelx wallet serf manage nftickets pay binance pay added company talk integrate exchange travelx built algorand blockchain made infrastructure open company exchange marketplace travelx apis create marketplace month platform hope incorporate inventory airline special focus latin american european operator company focus middle company closed seed round led borderless capital added plan raise series funding round company employee travelx founded lafosse previously founded almundo tourism marketplace sold cvc corporation platform transaction usdc stablecoin plan incorporate stablecoins eventually integrate coin developed airline added travelx charge user purchase ticket platform receive transaction made platform peer peer secondary market airline,-0.031096681096681098,negative,0.2698412698412698,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.91, 'pos': 0.071, 'compound': 0.8316}",0.8316,0.019,0.91,0.071,positive,0.99999950000025,0.01538461526627219,positive

Bitstamp, another crypto trading platform, was  registered in the Netherlands  in April 2021. Once the EU's markets in crypto assets (MiCA) regulation comes into force, Coinbase will be able offer crypto trading services in the other 26 EU nations. The EU  completed the full text of that legislation  this week. Registration or licensing applications are underway in several other major markets, Coinbase said.

binance,Markets,"Luna Classic, Remnant of Terra Collapse, Jumps 60% as Binance Unveils Burn Scheme","Luna classic ( LUNC ), the remnant token of the failed Terra blockchain  prior to its reboot , surged on Monday after Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, unveiled a scheme to reduce the supply of the token. The LUNC price jumped as much as 60% on the news, reaching as high as $0.00032, according to cryptocurrency price tracker  CoinGecko . The token was changing hands at around $0.00029 at press time. The sudden rally caught many traders by surprise, especially because many of them had bet that the LUNC price would fall on the news that Interpol had  issued  a “red notice” for Terra’s founder, Do Kwon. Some $1.5 million of short positions have been liquidated during the day, the highest in at least three months, according to Coinglass. Traders who bet on LUNC’s price to fall after Interpol’s “red notice” on Do Kwon were liquidated after Binance's announcement. (Coinglass) The  Terra ecosystem’s collapse  in May was one of the most dramatic implosions in the crypto market. It wiped out $60 billion in market value and caused some crypto firms to become insolvent. Earlier this month,  South Korean authorities issued an arrest warrant  for Kwon on charges of fraud. Many developers who were building applications on the original-and-now-abandoned blockchain  have moved over  to the newly rebooted Terra blockchain or to other networks like Polygon or Kadena that are seen as having more staying power. At least one analyst has suggested that LUNC is now a “ meme coin ,” with few use cases beyond providing traders with speculation and quick profits (or losses). Read more:  Luna (LUNA) vs. Luna Classic (LUNC): What Is the Difference? Earlier this month, the LUNC token  surged  in anticipation of a community-approved plan to reduce the token’s hyperinflated supply. The so-called “supply burn plan” aims to destroy – burn in crypto terms – 1.2% of every LUNC transaction on the blockchain. The mechanism doesn't apply to buying and selling tokens on exchanges, but some crypto exchanges such as MEXC voluntarily decided to adopt the supply reduction mechanism. The burn scheme Binance just announced, however, may have less of an impact than many traders hope. According to a  statement , the crypto exchange will destroy the equivalent of the trading fees when a trader sells or buys LUNC. Traders on Binance may opt for applying the 1.2% “burn fee” voluntarily. Given that  trading fees  on Binance range from 0.1% to as low as 0.02% for large traders, the burn rate is just a fraction of the 1.2% transaction burn rate. Traders who move the most volume on the exchange, such as market makers, are unlikely to voluntarily choose the 1.2% fees, crypto trader  Ogle  pointed out in a Twitter post.

binance,Markets,Huobi Token Surges 75% as Tron Founder Justin Sun Calls for Empowering the Exchange Token,"Investors who bargain-hunted Huobi token (HT) at 21-month lows a week ago may be laughing their way to the bank. The native coin of China's once-popular crypto exchange Huobi Global has rallied over 70% since Monday, reaching a four-month high of $7.60, according to data sourced from charting platform TradingView. Considering the broader market lull and lingering macroeconomic uncertainty, that's an impressive performance. And it has put HT on the pedestal as the best-performing above $1 billion market cap cryptocurrency of the past seven days. The token has decoupled from the broader market, seemingly on optimism that it will play a central role in a plan to revitalize the Huobi exchange. ""We know that the key to revitalizing Huobi is to empower HT, and HT can only thrive on Huobi,"" Tron's founder Justin Sun  tweeted Monday , announcing his membership on Huobi's global advisory board. ""In the future, there will be many big moves around HT, including brand upgrade, heavy empowerment, and business cooperation."" Huobi token's daily price chart (TradingView, CoinDesk) (TradingView, CoinDesk) During an appearance on Tuesday on CoinDesk's "" First Mover "" show,  Sun said  the HT token is central to Huobi's success, drawing parallels with Binance coin's (BNB) pivotal role in establishing Binance as the leading cryptocurrency exchange. ""The success of BNB really benefits the Binance platform. So, I think in terms of operations, we need to focus on HT,"" Sun said. Additionally, the change of management and fresh capital infusion looks to have given wings to the battered HT token, which remains 81.77% down from its all-time high set in May, 2021. Last Friday, the exchange announced it has  agreed to sell  its entire shareholding to Hong Kong-based About Capital Management. The news came after months of speculation that founder Leon Li was looking to sell his 60% stake in the exchange for at least $1 billion. The 2013-founded Huobi ran into a rough patch last year after China  put a blanket ban  on cryptocurrencies, taking a significant chunk of users away from the exchange. The exchange was  reportedly mulling  a 30% reduction in staff early this year to mitigate the loss in revenue due to the China crackdown. Huobi, however, is confident about its prospects. ""Under new ownership, the exchange is plotting an international expansion and will receive an injection of sufficient capital in margin and risk provision fund,"" the official announcement  said . Ted Chen, the CEO of About Capital Management,  called  the Huobi acquisition a significant milestone for the industry, saying the exchange is still in its early stage of development and there remains tremendous room for growth. At press time, Huobi was the world's eighth-largest cryptocurrency exchange by trading volumes, according to data source  CoinGecko .",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/10/13/huobi-token-surges-75-as-justin-sun-calls-for-empowering-the-exchange-token/,coindesk,2022-10-13,09:11:00,en,454,2847,5.244493392070485,159,0.3502202643171806,investor bargain hunted huobi token ht low ago laughing bank native coin popular crypto exchange huobi global rallied reaching data sourced charting platform tradingview broader market lull lingering macroeconomic uncertainty impressive performance put ht pedestal performing market cap cryptocurrency past day token decoupled broader market seemingly optimism play central role plan revitalize huobi exchange revitalizing huobi empower ht ht thrive huobi tron founder tweeted announcing membership huobi global advisory future big move ht including upgrade heavy empowerment business cooperation huobi token chart tradingview coindesk tradingview coindesk appearance coindesk mover show ht token central huobi success drawing parallel binance coin bnb pivotal role establishing binance leading cryptocurrency exchange success bnb benefit binance platform term operation focus ht additionally change management fresh capital infusion wing battered ht token remains time set exchange announced agreed entire shareholding based capital management news month speculation founder stake exchange founded huobi ran rough put blanket ban cryptocurrencies taking significant chunk user exchange exchange reportedly mulling reduction staff mitigate loss revenue due crackdown huobi confident prospect ownership exchange plotting international expansion receive injection sufficient capital margin risk provision fund official announcement ceo capital management called huobi acquisition significant milestone industry exchange stage development remains tremendous room growth press time huobi world largest cryptocurrency exchange trading volume data source coingecko,0.16284722222222223,positive,0.4149305555555556,"{'neg': 0.05, 'neu': 0.767, 'pos': 0.182, 'compound': 0.9829}",0.9829,0.05,0.767,0.182,positive,0.3846153550295881,0.06435643532496814,positive
binance, News , Binance exchange burns $547M worth of BNB tokens ,"Crypto exchange platform Binance has concluded its 21st quarterly BNB ( BNB ) burn, eliminating around $547 million worth of BNB tokens from its supply.  In an announcement, Binance  said  that it had destroyed a total of 2,065,152 BNB tokens, which is valued at just below $600 million at the time of writing. The exchange also mentioned that an added 4,833.25 BNB was  burned  through its Pioneer Burn Program, a  mechanism  that helps users who have lost their digital assets through honest mistakes.  The exchange covers these losses and returns the tokens to users, depending on the specific conditions. These tokens are then deducted from the total quarterly burn by Binance. #Binance  Completes 21st Quarterly  #BNB  Burn!  2.06m  #BNB  has been burned   pic.twitter.com/VHvt1E4FzB — Binance (@binance)  October 13, 2022 
 
 Previously, Binance committed to burning 20% of its profits for each quarter. With the latest burn, the exchange could have profited by $2.7 billion during the third quarter of 2022.  The 21st quarterly BNB burn is one of the larges amounts burned in BNB burn history in terms of its fiat value. Back in 2021, around $600 million in BNB was burned, marking the  largest BNB burn on record .  Despite the massive amount burned, the burning efforts don't seem to have had a huge impact on t Binance Coin markets at the moment, with BNB prices moving slowly downward along with the rest of the crypto market.

binance, Follow up , BNB Chain responds with next steps for cross-chain security after network exploit ,"BNB Chain, the native blockchain of Binance Coin ( BNB ) and the Binance crypto exchange, has been subject to security-related developments over the last month. On Thursday, Oct. 6 the network experienced a multi-million dollar cross-chain exploit. The incident caused  BNB Chain to temporarily suspend  all withdrawal and deposit activity on the network. Initially, the announcement of the network outage cited “irregular activity” with an update stating it was “under maintenance.” As rumors were confirmed the CEO of Binance, Changpeng Zhao  tweeted  out an apology for any inconvenience to the BNB Chain community. However the suspension was brief, as the BNB Chain Team announced  the network was back online  early on Oct. 7, just hours after the attack. As the network regained activity its validators confirmed their location and were asked to upgrade the community infrastructure. Later the same day, BNB Chain released its first official  statement  thanking the community for its support during the incident, along with the next steps for ensuring future network security. UPDATE: Official BNB Chain Response.  We're humbled by the support, hard work, and dedication from the community of which we are proud to be a part. https://t.co/r0TcZYxFzJ — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN)  October 7, 2022 
 
 In the statement, the BNB Chain Team owned up to the exploit and apologized to users. They also expressed gratitude to how quickly the issue was identified and resolved by the community. During the Oct. 6 exploit the hacker was able to withdraw a total of 2 million BNB, which is roughly $568 million at the time of writing. This number was confirmed in the official statement released by the team. It also reported 26 active validators on the BNB Smart Chain during the incident, with 44 in total in different time zones. Related:  BNB Chain launches a new community-run security mechanism to protect users In addition to official numbers related to the incident, the BNB Chain highlighted its next steps to ensure future network security against potential exploits. An on-chain governance vote will decide what to do with hacked funds, whether they should be frozen and if BNB Auto-Burn should be implemented to cover the remaining exploited funds. The community will also vote on a bounty for catching hackers and a white-hat program for future bugs found which could be $1 million for each. Prior to the official statement being released, Zhao tweeted his amazement at the swift response and transparency of the BNB Chain team. Agreed. I was impressed by the quick actions the  @BNBChain  team took. I am not that involved in the technical side of BNB Chain. Far less than Vitalik with ETH. The principles of issue handling are simple & important: fast, transparent & responsible.   https://t.co/eOJrAzWG97 — CZ  Binance (@cz_binance)  October 7, 2022 
 
 In August a report from Chainaylsis revealed that  $2 billion in crypto was stolen from cross-chain bridges  in the last year alone. This includes major exploits such as the $190 million Nomad Bridge incident. Michael Lewellen, head of solutions architecture at OpenZeppelin, told Cointelegraph that in an instance where   a ""project team retains some level of administrative control"" in their decentralized ecosystem some type of monitoring should be implemented. “They should have comprehensive security monitoring to ensure they can use those powers swiftly when needed.” While community initiatives are productive, such as the ones BNB Chain proposed as a follow up, Lewellen said real-time security monitoring is a tool that can, “put-out fires before they have a chance to spread."" “Ultimately, the end user can follow good security practices, but without the integration of real-time monitoring and incident response by the developers, users remain at their mercy."" According to Lewellen, real-time, ongoing security monitoring can watch over the processes that make up the decentralized space without affecting or impinging upon them. Researchers are also  considering  reversible crypto transactions  as a viable solution to fight crime in the industry. In a subsequent  statement , BNB Chain spoke on the decentralization of their network, as many Twitter critics surfaced in light of the exploit. One user tweeted that the network may seem decentralized to the “untrained eye” but it is indeed not: 1/9) There is a good reason why some are surprised by the BNB rollback today Even though BNB has always been entirely centralized & permissioned! As BNB seems decentralized to an untrained eye However, its 21 ""validators"" are chosen by a committee of 11, controlled by Binance! — Justin Bons (@Justin_Bons)  October 7, 2022 
 
 BNB Chain responded with the statement that “decentralization is journey” and while it's currently less decentralized than the Ethereum blockchain, it is “more decentralized than many others."" The update went on to detail the components of the blockchain and the role Binance plays in the ecosystem. According to the post, anyone can become a network validator if enough BNB is put forward and that: “Nobody can control the decisions taken here, least of all Binance."" However, the debate rages on between Twitter users, with some commending the team for a swift response and others  posting  centralization-themed memes about the network. Zhao also hopped into the debate, posting his thoughts on centralization vs decentralization, echoing sentiments from a similar  piece  he wrote three years ago: My views on Centralization Vs.

 Within less than a week of the BNB Chain exploit, the space saw a nother exploit with $100 million taken from the Solana decentralized finance platform  Mango Markets. The Solana network is also often touted for being too centralized. Regardless of the hack and the centralization debate, the network pushed out its latest testnet upgrade v1.1.16 on Oct. 12.",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-responds-with-next-steps-for-cross-chain-security-after-network-exploit,cointelegraph,2022-10-17,00:00:00,en,944,6004,5.308262711864407,365,0.3866525423728814,bnb chain native blockchain binance coin bnb binance crypto exchange subject security related development network experienced multi chain exploit incident caused bnb chain temporarily suspend withdrawal deposit activity network initially announcement network outage cited irregular activity update stating maintenance rumor confirmed ceo binance changpeng tweeted apology inconvenience bnb chain community suspension bnb chain team announced network online hour attack network regained activity validators confirmed location asked upgrade community infrastructure bnb chain released official statement thanking community support incident step ensuring future network security update official bnb chain response humbled support hard work dedication community proud part http tczyxfzj bnb chain bnbchain statement bnb chain team owned exploit apologized user expressed gratitude quickly issue identified resolved community exploit withdraw total bnb roughly time writing number confirmed official statement released team reported active validators bnb chain incident total time zone related bnb chain launch community run security mechanism protect user addition official related incident bnb chain highlighted step ensure future network security potential exploit chain governance vote decide hacked fund frozen bnb auto burn implemented remaining exploited fund community vote bounty catching hacker hat program future bug found official statement released tweeted amazement response transparency bnb chain team agreed impressed action bnbchain team involved technical side bnb chain vitalik eth principle issue handling simple important transparent responsible http eojrazwg cz binance cz binance report chainaylsis revealed crypto stolen chain includes exploit nomad incident lewellen solution architecture openzeppelin told cointelegraph instance project team retains level administrative control decentralized ecosystem type monitoring implemented comprehensive security monitoring ensure swiftly needed community initiative productive bnb chain proposed follow lewellen time security monitoring tool put fire spread ultimately end user follow security practice integration time monitoring incident response developer user remain lewellen time ongoing security monitoring watch process make decentralized space affecting impinging researcher reversible crypto transaction viable solution fight crime industry subsequent statement bnb chain spoke decentralization network twitter critic surfaced exploit user tweeted network decentralized untrained eye reason surprised bnb rollback today bnb centralized permissioned bnb decentralized untrained eye validators chosen committee controlled binance bons bons bnb chain responded statement decentralization journey decentralized ethereum blockchain decentralized update detail component blockchain role binance play ecosystem network validator bnb put forward control decision binance debate rage twitter user commending team response posting centralization themed meme network hopped debate posting thought centralization decentralization echoing sentiment similar piece wrote year ago view centralization decentralization binance blog http dkvyu cz binance cz binance bnb chain exploit space nother exploit solana decentralized finance platform mango market solana network touted centralized centralization debate network pushed latest testnet upgrade,0.16692708333333334,positive,0.5814732142857143,"{'neg': 0.091, 'neu': 0.753, 'pos': 0.156, 'compound': 0.9823}",0.9823,0.091,0.753,0.156,positive,-0.6129032060353804,0.07542579057074017,negative
binance,Business,"Crypto Exchange Coinbase Waives Fees for Converting Between USDC and Fiat, Eyeing Global Audience","Publicly traded crypto exchange Coinbase (COIN) will waive commission fees for  USD coin  (USDC) sales and purchases made in any fiat currency in a push to promote the wider global adoption of its stablecoin, it  said in a blog post  Thursday. The company's policy change is effective immediately. “Users usually have to pay fees in the process of converting their local currency into USDC, and this is a barrier to broader international adoption,” the post read. “The way to correct this, and accelerate adoption of USDC internationally, is by establishing global parity for all users.” Coinbase’s decision to promote USDC (which it issues as a co-founder of the Centre Consortium) comes at a time when inflation is on the rise globally, with consumers in rich countries and poor feeling the heat of rising prices. That has prompted some to move their volatile fiat currencies into stablecoins such as USDC, which is pegged in value to the U.S. dollar.

binance,Markets,"Crypto Game Axie's AXS Tokens Get Unlocked, Recipients Send $5.7M Worth to Exchanges","Axie Infinity , the play-to-earn crypto game that rose to sudden popularity last year, started releasing previously restricted  AXS  tokens to early investors and insiders as part of a  massive $200 million unlocking event . The unlock came with an unexpected bit of drama: a swift rally in crypto markets that wiped out some traders who had been betting that dumping by long-time holders might result in a price decline. The short squeeze drove up the price, possibly making the market conditions even more tempting for would-be dumpers. Crypto traders have been monitoring the timing of the token vesting period, partly because of the possibility that some investors might choose to sell their holdings, which could theoretically drive down the price. Vesting refers to the period of time when certain investors and insiders have to wait before claiming their assets; the point is to ensure they are invested for the long-term and prevent immediate sales. Once the vesting period expires – and the tokens become unlocked – all's fair game. Blockchain data shows that a wallet tagged as “Axie Infinity: Token Vesting” transferred some 785,334 AXS tokens ($6.6 million worth) to six recipients. The recipients were listed as Axie’s advisors and early investors in a private sale round in mid-2020, according to the site  TokenUnlock . Some 21.5 million AXS (worth $200 million) are about to be released in the upcoming days. About 10 million tokens unlocking are for early investors, advisors and the developer team, potentially creating selling pressure for the coin. Digital asset management firm Arca, one of the institutional investors that purchased AXS during the private sale,  received  $4 million in AXS (437,500 tokens) to a wallet linked to the company. Then, it deposited all the tokens crypto exchange FTX, according to  blockchain data  from Etherscan and Nansen. Arca representatives didn't immediately reply to a request for comment. Another early investor claimed $1.7 million in AXS (187,500 tokens), and soon moved the tokens to crypto exchange Binance,  blockchain data  shows. Transferring coins to exchanges indicate that these investors may dump their holdings, pocketing an immense profit on their original investment. Investors who participated in the private sale bought AXS at 8 cents. Given that the crypto currently trades at around $9, they may pocket a 11,150% profit on their initial stake. Crypto investment firms DeFiance Capital and Delphi Digital can claim $1.5 million (160,000 tokens) and $6.8 million (750,000 tokens), respectively, according to TokenUnlock. Blockchain data indicates that they are yet to obtain their share of tokens. Owners of the wallet addresses have been identified by blockchain intelligence platform  Nansen . Axie Infinity’s vesting wallet started to release tokens Tuesday to insiders and early investors. (Nansen) Short squeeze Crypto traders anticipated that AXS’s price would drop after the unlocking, similar to previous events. Prior to the unlock, AXS was one of the worst-performing crypto assets by dropping 24% in a week, according to Messari. Traders positioned themselves for dropping further, building up shorts – bets designed toprofit from an asset’s price fall – and funding rates tilted overwhelmingly negative on most exchanges, according to  data  by Coinglass. AXS , however, surged 7% in the last 24 hours amid a recent market-wide rebound, catching shorts by off-guard. The whiplash liquidated $1.6 million short positions, the most in at least three months. At press time, AXS is changing hands at $8.99, more than 90% down from its previous all-time high last year. $1.6 million shorts were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the highest number since summer.

binance,Business,Crypto Exchange FTX Is Working on Creating a Stablecoin: Report,"Cryptocurrency exchange FTX is working on creating a stablecoin, CEO Sam Bankman-Fried told  The Big Whale  in an interview. Bankman-Fried said in the interview ""it is very likely"" FTX will create a stablecoin, a  crypto token whose value is tied  to that of another asset. The exchange knows how to create one and is thinking about the best partner to work with, he said. He also hinted that an announcement will come soon. However, in a  follow-up tweet on Friday , Bankman-Fried noted that FTX is still determining a potential pathway. ""Eh to clarify: we are figuring out what we're doing on stablecoins; it could be anything or nothing, and could *or could not* involve partnerships, issuance, hula hoops, etc. (One of those is less likely than the others.),"" he tweeted. FTX currently offers margin trading that allows customers to use a basket of U.S. dollar stablecoins as collateral. The basket includes trueUSD (TUSD), USD coin (USDC), Pax dollar (USDP), HUSD and Binance USD (BUSD). Rival exchange Binance started  issuing Binance USD  in 2019. The rise of tether (USDT), which is the largest stablecoin and has a market cap of $68 billion, also provides a use-case of how stablecoins can thrive even under regulatory scrutiny. Tether is owned by iFinex, a Hong Kong holding company that also owns crypto exchange Bitfinex. FTX has been spending during the current bear market, making several large acquisitions including a  deal to buy crypto lending business BlockFi  for up to $240 million. While Bankman-Fried  bought a 7.6% stake  in retail trading app Robinhood (HOOD) in May, FTX is not interested in acquiring the entire company, he said in the interview.

Source: TradingView BNB sets new record against BTC Data from  Cointelegraph Markets Pro  and  TradingView  confirms that BNB/BTC briefly spiked above 0.15 BTC to a record 0.15267 BTC on Oct. 30. BNB, the in-house token of Binance, the largest crypto exchange by volume, has gained around 10% in the past 72 hours. The strong performance came on the back of reports that Binance was preparing to assist Twitter in eradicating bots as part of its new direction under Elon Musk. Binance had  contributed $500 million  to Musk’s takeover of the social media platform. “Our intern says we wired the $500 million 2 days ago, probably just as I was being asked about Elon/Twitter,” Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao  wrote  in a cryptic tweet referencing comments he made to crypto media outlet Decrypt. Further posts from CZ stated, “Let’s unleash the bird,” and “Crypto Twitter,” the former appearing to be referencing Musk’s  own tweet , “the bird is freed.” In U.S. dollar terms, meanwhile, BNB hit highs of $318.80 on the day, its best performance since mid-August.

Related:  Dogecoin price rallies 150% in 4 days, but DOGE now most 'overbought' since April 2021 In a  familiar setup , actions by Musk linked to Twitter sent DOGE price action into a frenzy, with DOGE/USD hitting its highest levels since April. Long a pet favorite of Musk, DOGE is still waiting for its shot at a wider use application, possibly with his involvement. In the meantime, popular pseudonymous analyst Tree of Alpha  suggests  retail traders may do the work, helped by both the Twitter and Binance ecosystems. “Another ATH in complete silence as the dog coin longers rejoice,” they wrote about BNB, adding: “Imagine the smell when launchpads become a thing again and retail is back to turbo buying garbage on BSC.

binance,Business,"Crypto Exchange Binance to Use Twitter as Web 3 ‘Sandbox,’ Help Musk Fend Off Bots: Exec","Binance chipped in $500 million as an equity partner with Elon Musk to buy Twitter in hopes of using the social media platform as a “sandbox” to deal with Web 3 issues, according to the exchange’s chief strategy officer, Patrick Hillman. “We look at this as a massive historic opportunity for R&D [research and development],” Hillman told CoinDesk TV’s “First Mover” program Tuesday. “[It’s] a chance to take a prestigious Web2 platform and use it as a sandbox to start taking apart some of the challenges that we've seen become synthetical in the Web2 space.” Hillman said the world’s largest cryptocurrency exchange by  volume  is looking to be a “critical partner” in Twitter’s growth and innovation and would turn to “Web3 solutions” to solve some of the challenges on the platform, such as non-fungible token (NFT) user authentication and whether the platform could be used as payments system to “create small micro transactions.” Read more:  Binance’s CEO Confirms Participating as Equity Investor in Musk’s Twitter Takeover Besides running Tesla and SpaceX, Musk is one of the co-founders of payments giant PayPal, through a predecessor company. The payment strategy could be used as a way to fend off bots, Hillman said, making it so “the average user could bear the cost” while making it “extraordinarily expensive” for bots to be able to sustain their activity. The issue of bots goes “well beyond people trying to pump coins,” said Hillman, adding that bots have soured the ability for the crypto community to use the Twitter platform as a place to speak freely. “Being able to attack and address that bot issue is going to be critical to reopening a healthy dialogue around crypto,” Hillman said, adding that other issues, including  pump and dump schemes , would also need to be addressed.

binance,Opinion,Analyzing What's Next for Europe's Markets in Crypto Assets Law,"The European Union is set to be the first major jurisdiction in the world to agree how to regulate the digital asset sector, via its Markets in Crypto Assets regulation (MiCA). Under the  recently agreed text , providers of crypto services – which means anything from trading to custody to fiat exchanges – will need a license and be monitored by a financial regulator from one of the EU’s member states (Germany’s  BaFin , say). Issuers of stablecoins – crypto assets which claim to maintain their value against assets such as the euro – will be subject to a bunch of other rules to ensure they keep their promise; regulators want them to hold reserves to avoid another  Terra-style debacle . Broadly, the rules get tougher for stablecoins that are more widely used, and for those tied to foreign fiat; EU governments are worried about their own currencies losing influence. Issuers’ white papers also need to be fair, clear and honest – a legacy of the time when initial coin offerings were all the rage, and often turned out to be scams. All that’s easier said than done. Just to apply for a license you already need to be an EU-based legal entity, such as a company or formal partnership – which already rules out many decentralized governance models. (Witness Binance, which for a long time declined to say  where its headquarters is located , or even that it had one). In return for jumping through those hoops, crypto companies can serve the entire bloc, which numbers some 450 million people. Perhaps more importantly, even if imperfect, the rules should be clear, mitigating the risk of  capricious or unpredictable enforcement  seen in the U.S. and elsewhere. Broadly, the industry has welcomed the new law, despite concerns that a cap on the use of dollar stablecoins could inhibit trading. EU lawmakers such as Ondřej Kovařík may have  buyers’ remorse , but political haggling on the law is now over. After a couple more bits of rubber stamping, it could be etched into the statute book early next year. The rules will apply between 12 and 18 months later, with the stablecoin measures coming in first. Between now and then, the EU agencies responsible for banking and securities markets will need to set out everything from the design of forms and qualifications for executives, to how crypto firms should measure energy footprints and manage customer complaints. The industry, aware that the devil is in the details, is watching eagerly. “I think a lot of MiCA's practical success honestly depends on those technical standards,” Circle’s Patrick Hansen told an Oct. 25 conference in Brussels. Expect a bunch of consultations from EU agencies like the  EBA  and  ESMA  to appear around fall 2023. Plus national authorities will need to set out exactly how their procedures will work, including places such as  France  which already have some form of crypto license. MiCA matters because it could end up being a template for the world – just as the EU’s ambitious rules in, say, data protection influenced others looking to safeguard privacy online. “I think there's a reasonable expectation that MiCA will influence rulemaking across the world… it will probably bring efficiencies to a lot of global companies like ours,” Binance’s Director of EU Affairs Hugo Coelho told the same conference [Oct 25]. Sometimes countries copy each others’ homework, and it’s not always a bad thing. The risk of getting overtaken by the EU was certainly noted by lawmakers in the U.K. – formerly a member of the bloc, and now its rival – as they rushed through their own  stablecoin plans last week . Despite its ambition, MiCA leaves a lot out: It doesn’t fully cover decentralized finance, non-fungible tokens or crypto lending. Expect a further report on those issues in 2025, and maybe another bill, too.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/02/analyzing-whats-next-for-europes-markets-in-crypto-assets-law/,coindesk,2022-11-02,17:00:00,en,642,3804,4.904984423676012,258,0.40186915887850466,european union set jurisdiction world agree regulate digital asset sector market crypto asset regulation recently agreed text provider crypto service trading custody fiat exchange license monitored financial regulator eu member state bafin issuer stablecoins crypto asset claim maintain asset euro subject rule ensure promise regulator hold reserve avoid style debacle broadly rule tougher stablecoins widely tied foreign fiat eu government worried currency losing influence issuer paper clear honest legacy time initial coin offering rage turned scam easier apply license eu based legal entity company formal partnership rule decentralized governance model witness binance time declined headquarters located return jumping hoop crypto company serve entire bloc people importantly imperfect rule clear mitigating risk capricious unpredictable enforcement broadly industry welcomed concern cap stablecoins inhibit trading eu lawmaker ondřej kovařík buyer remorse political haggling couple bit rubber stamping etched statute rule apply month stablecoin measure coming eu agency responsible banking security market set design form qualification executive crypto firm measure energy footprint manage customer complaint industry aware devil detail watching eagerly lot practical success honestly depends technical standard circle told conference brussels expect consultation eu agency eba esma fall national authority set procedure work including place form crypto license matter end template world eu ambitious rule data protection influenced safeguard privacy online reasonable expectation influence rulemaking world bring efficiency lot global company binance director eu affair coelho told conference country copy homework bad thing risk overtaken eu noted lawmaker member bloc rival rushed stablecoin plan ambition leaf lot fully decentralized finance fungible token crypto lending expect report issue,0.052222222222222246,positive,0.3580555555555555,"{'neg': 0.113, 'neu': 0.679, 'pos': 0.208, 'compound': 0.9712}",0.9712,0.113,0.679,0.208,positive,-0.46666663555555765,0.06382978696242644,negative
binance,Business,"India's Crypto, Web3 Industry Forms New Advocacy Body","India's crypto industry has formed a new advocacy body almost four months after the previous one was disbanded under  cloudy circumstances , according to an announcement on Thursday. The body will be called Bharat Web3 Association (BWA), a shift in branding toward Web3 from the earlier Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC). The word Bharat represents the nation of India. The  BACC  was disbanded in July by its parent organization, the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI). That damped the mood of the crypto ecosystem during a crypto market downturn at the same time as  stiff new taxes  and macroeconomic factors were hurting the industry and its consumers. India's crypto tax regime was criticized Thursday by Changpeng Zhao, CEO of crypto exchange Binance, during a panel at a fintech conference in Singapore. Zhao said the high level of taxes is ""probably going to kill the industry,"" in the country, Bloomberg reported. Leading members of the new association involve Polygon, Hike, Coin DCX, CoinSwitch Kuber, Zebpay, and WazirX, making it the most prominent Web3 advocate in India. Some registration and procedural formalities remain, three people familiar with the plan said before the announcement. The goals of the body include driving awareness about Web3, pushing for technology and innovation, supporting ecosystem partners and outreach to regulators to communicate steps towards consumer protection. ""Owing to its thriving developer community, entrepreneurial spirit, fast-growing economy, sound digital infrastructure, and deep digital adoption, India is poised to become a leader in the Web3 space,"" said Sandeep Nailwal, a co-founder of Polygon Technology. ""BWA will play a pivotal role in helping India achieve its potential as a global Web3 leader,"" he added. India is gearing up for its yearlong stint of holding the presidency of the Group of 20 nations starting next month. The ""BWA is committed to working with the Government of India"" to lead a collaborative regulatory framework for digital assets, according to the announcement.

binance, Altcoin Watch ," Traders expect 200% upside from MATIC, but does Polygon network data support that? ","In the past year, Polygon ( MATIC ) has focused on growing their list of high-profile partners which includes luminaries like Disney, Starbucks and Robinhood. The recent announcements of partnerships with both Instagram and JPMorgan have speculators pushing the token price up nearly 200%.  In  addition to partnerships , blockchain adoption through network usage is important to examine. Blockchain adoption can be analyzed by looking into daily active users of the blockchain, protocols using the technology, number of transactions and total locked value.  Total value locked on Polygon rises above $1B Total value locked ( TVL ) is one cryptocurrency indicator used to assess the market’s sentiment towards a particular blockchain. TVL on Polygon requires utilizing the blockchain and locking funds in the various DeFi platforms available across the network.  Rising TVL is a sign of growth, or new liquidity entering the ecosystem, but it does not necessarily mean that the network and associated assets are “turning bullish.”  While the top three protocols, Ethereum, Binance and Tron all have a TVL of over $5 billion, Polygon, Avalanche and Arbitrum are the only others with over $1 billion in TVL.  According to data from Token Terminal, Polygon and Fantom are the only blockchains to post positive TVL numbers in both one-day and seven-day metrics.  Top blockchains sorted by TVL. Source: Defi Llama Top 3 protocol blockchain for developers Protocols are essentially decentralized applications ( DApps ) built using smart contracts on top of public blockchains. The  recently announced partnerships  have be tested but have not yet fully launched.  Even if the new partnerships do not fully materialize, the network is already a top contender for developers to build their smart contracts. Top blockchains sorted by protocol number. Source: Defi Llama Polygon is a newcomer when compared to Ethereum. So, although Ethereum has more protocols than Polygon, Ethereum launched its mainnet with a five-year head start.  Polygon’s astronomical growth in protocols launching on their blockchain is notable because, according to Token Terminal’s data, Ether’s ( ETH ) market cap dominates Polygon's ( MATIC ) 90% to 10%. Related:  JP Morgan executes first DeFi trade on public blockchain Polygon sees an uptick in fees and daily active users In addition to MATIC’s price growing 12% in the past month, the Polygon network's daily fees and daily active users have grown by 200% since Aug. 5, lending credence to the Cointelegraph prediction.  On August 5, Polygon collected $42,093 in fees and had 248,853 daily network users. By Oct. 13, the network’s daily active users peaked at 737,815 following the  success of the Reddit NFT avatar launch . On Oct. 25 the network hit a 90-day peak of $131,940 in daily fees.  Polygon network fees and daily active users. Source: Token Terminal When comparing the on-chain activity and analysis with the recent MATIC rally, the data suggests that speculation on the partnership news matches the fundamentals.  While it is a stretch to forecast a 200% potential gain in MATIC growth by only using technical analysis, Polygon’s network growth and daily active user stats are encouraging.  The number of transactions and TVL could be a sign that network fundamentals align with the expectations of technical analysts. Polygon’s strength versus competing chains, while still being only a fraction of Ether and BNB’s market cap is quite bullish for its long-term growth prospects.

binance,Business,Binance CEO Zhao Says Planned FTX Acquisition Is Not a 'Win for Us',"Binance CEO Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao wrote in a note to staff on Wednesday that the exchange's agreement to acquire rival FTX is not ""a win for us."" Zhao shared the memo  on Twitter  after the  Financial Times initially reported on it . FTX's near collapse has ""severely shaken"" confidence in the crypto industry and will see regulators ""scrutinize exchanges even more,"" Zhao wrote in the note. ""Licenses around the globe will be harder to get,” he added. The Sam Bankman-Fried-led exchange FTX  agreed to sell itself to the world's largest crypto exchange  Tuesday after it faced a liquidity crisis, following concerns about the makeup of sister firm Alameda Research's balance sheet,  first reported by CoinDesk on Nov. 2 . Binance initially responded to the report by selling all of its FTT tokens, the native coin of FTX, which hastened the widespread exodus of assets from the FTX platform. In his Wednesday note, Zhao reminded staff not to trade FTT tokens as due diligence for the deal continues. He acknowledged that Binance continued to own FTT tokens but that as soon as he finished talking to Bankman-Fried on Tuesday, he told his team to stop selling its holdings of FTT. “We need to hold ourselves to a higher standard than even in banks,” Zhao wrote. Zhao also said in his staff note that Binance ""did not master plan this or anything related to it."" ""It was less than 24 hours ago that SBF called me. And before that, I had very little knowledge of the internal state of things at FTX. I could do some mental calculations with our revenues to guess theirs, but it would never be very accurate,"" Zhao wrote.

binance,Business,"Stablecoin Heavyweights Circle and Tether Distance Themselves From FTX, Alameda ","Circle and Tether, the firms behind stablecoins USDC and USDT, respectively, distanced themselves from crypto exchange FTX and trading firm Alameda Research as the crypto market grapples with the fallout from FTX's fall from grace. Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire took to Twitter to explain the firm's relationship with the two companies. Allaire said Circle has never given loans to FTX or Alameda and has never received FTT as collateral. Allaire added that both Circle and FTX hold only a small portion of equity in each other.

binance,Markets,Huobi Asset Transparency Report Reveals $3.5B in Crypto Holdings,"Huobi Global, once China's top crypto exchange, published an asset transparency report on Sunday to reassure users that its funds remain safe. As of Nov. 12, there were 191.84 million Huobi token, or HT, ($900 million) on the platform along with 9.7 billion TRX, 820 million USDT, 274,000 ETH and 32,000 BTC, and several other coins, including ATOM, ADA, BCH, DOGE, DOT, MATIC, SHIB and ETC. The total estimated value of reserves was $3.5 billion,  the report said . Huobi said HT tokens are not only held by the Huobi Global, but some of them are also held by Huobi Global’s users. The revelation came days after FTX, formerly the third largest digital assets exchange by volume, imploded in response to a  CoinDesk report  that showed the exchange's sister company Alameda Research's balance sheet, was primarily made up of FTX's native token, FTT. Since then, crypto exchanges worldwide have been  scrambling  to  publish  so-called proof of reserves to assure users that their funds aren't being channeled into other investments. On Nov. 10, leading crypto exchange Binance released the list of its cold wallets and reserves, disclosing $69 billion in crypto reserve. ""Huobi is acting now to disclose the balance details of our hot and cold wallets and make this disclosure a routine going forward,"" the exchange said in the report, adding that it performed a Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit early last month when the exchange's founder Leon Li sold his controller stake to About Capital. Huobi promised to publish another Merkle Tree Proof of Reserves audit conducted by a third party within 30 days to boost user confidence further. Under the Merkel Tree audit, an independent entity takes an anonymized snapshot of all crypto balances held by the exchange and aggregates them into a Merkel tree, a structure normally used to check the integrity of block data. Huobi's disclosure, however, failed to calm market nerves. The HT token was recently trading at $4.8, down 8.9% over the last 24 hours, according to CoinDesk data. The exchange  reportedly  saw an outflow of 10,000 ETH after it published the asset reserve report. Data from South Korea-based blockchain analytics firm CryptoQuant shows a total of 12,000 ETH ($15.14 million) have left Huobi in the past six hours. Huobi said the outflow was part of routine operations. ""The true situation is that the addresses we listed include some hot wallets;  the on-chain deposits and withdrawals are part of the normal operation.  The exchange is operating normally now,"" a spokesperson from Huobi's PR team told CoinDesk in an email. The platform has the ""ability and strength to ensure the safety of users' assets and 100% payment, and there is not and will not be any restrictions on users' withdrawal,"" the spokesperson added. 12:45 UTC:  Edits the DEK and the third para to say th ere were 191.84 millions of HT on the platform.

binance,Features,"The State of Crypto Taxation in India: Past, Present and Future","India’s current fiscal year ending in March marks the first financial year where India, the country housing the  largest percentage of crypto users in the world , is finally providing clarity on crypto taxes. Anyone who is a tax resident of India and makes money in crypto – whether they are a trader, miner, yield farmer or airdrop recipient – must declare their assets and pay a tax under the new Finance Bill of 2022. This piece is a part of  Tax Week , sponsored by Koinly. Officially, though, India still hasn’t made its mind up about whether cryptocurrencies are even legal. “[Whether crypto is] legitimate or illegitimate, it is a different question, but I will tax because it is a sovereign right to tax,” Finance Minister  Nirmala Sitharaman said in February . Lipsa Das is a freelance crypto writer and strategist based in India. While the legality of crypto in India is still a matter of debate, the government has made moves to crack down on its usage – with  multiple probes into major cryptocurrency exchanges  and  notices to high-net-worth individuals . Below, we explore how the regulatory landscape in India has evolved over the years and look at the impact that taxes have had on crypto. A timeline of India’s crypto laws The Reserve Bank of India and the government have historically been apprehensive about crypto transactions, with warnings and bans to the stringent new tax bill. Here’s a quick timeline of how crypto has fared over the years in India: 2013: The RBI issues a circular that warns investors about speculative investments such as cryptocurrencies. 2013-2017: Coupled with the movement toward digital payments in India, the crypto industry establishes its roots. Indian exchanges such as Zebbay and Unocoin start to gain traction. 2017: Two writ petitions are filed – one to ban cryptocurrencies and one to regulate cryptocurrencies. The government forms a regulatory body to investigate cryptocurrencies further. 2018: Despite multiple warnings by the RBI, Indian crypto markets add a  record number of users . To counter that trend, the RBI issues a circular in April restricting banks and lenders from any association with crypto exchanges, effectively strangling the blossoming industry. 2019-2020: Indian exchanges and blockchain advocates go to court, filing multiple petitions in a bid to overturn the ban on cryptocurrency. 2020: After a drawn-out case, the Indian Supreme Court finally strikes down the RBI order, declaring it unconstitutional to prohibit trading without any regulations. That coincides with the crypto boom of 2020 and serves as the break the Indian crypto market desperately needs. 2021: The government continues its efforts to curtail the crypto industry by proposing a blanket ban on private currencies and introducing a private central bank digital currency instead. 2022: While crypto laws are still under discussion, the budget bill specifying crypto tax regulations is passed in March. Prior to the budget bill of 2022, Indian government officials didn’t have an official stance on the taxation of cryptocurrencies, but that doesn’t mean the tokens weren’t taxed. Any profits made from trading cryptocurrencies frequently were treated as “business or other income” and taxed as such. In contrast, if a taxpayer purchased crypto as an investment, it would be categorized as a capital asset, provided their overall trading activity was infrequent in nature. Upon sale of said cryptocurrencies, it would be subject to a long-term or short-term capital gains tax, depending on the holding period. In the absence of a regulatory framework, there was no uniformity in how crypto transactions were reported, and in some cases, they weren’t reported at all. For instance, tax could be realized only when crypto was converted to fiat. So, if you were to swap two different cryptocurrencies on your MetaMask wallet, you weren’t legally required to report it. The Finance Bill of 2022 initiated a complete overhaul of how cryptocurrencies are treated in India. The new standard for crypto taxation Effective since April 1, the Finance Bill is one of India's first laws to recognize cryptocurrencies. Importantly, it classifies cryptocurrencies as “virtual digital assets,” separating them from “currencies” backed by the central bank. The definition of “virtual digital assets” is intentionally broad and covers all cryptocurrencies, tokens and NFTs ( non-fungible tokens ). But because the terminology is relatively new, the definition is still evolving. For instance,  a circular dated June 30  exempted gift vouchers, reward points and subscriptions from being categorized as virtual digital assets, or VDAs. So, what’s taxed? According to 115BBH section of the Finance Bill, a taxable event is defined as: 1. Conversion of a VDA to Indian rupees or any other fiat currency. 2. Conversion of one type of virtual digital asset to another type (crypto-to-crypto trading, including stablecoins). 3. Paying for goods and services with a virtual digital asset. All profits from the above transactions are subject to a 30% tax, which is equivalent to India's highest income tax bracket. There’s an additional surcharge that depends on the income bracket of the individual. Further, if the transaction exceeds 10,000 rupees, it will be taxed by an additional 1%. Not all crypto transactions are subject to the 30% tax, though. Activities such as gifting crypto, staking rewards, receiving payments, airdrops, mining coins and other DeFi ( decentralized finance ) transactions are still viewed as “income.” In such instances, taxes are calculated according to the recipient’s income tax rate. However, if you choose to hold the assets and sell them later, you will be liable to pay a 30% tax on any appreciation in asset market value. What about losses? One of the most criticized aspects of crypto tax law in India is that losses aren’t acknowledged, meaning you can’t offset capital gains with losses or business expenses. In an industry where losses are more common than profits, this clause is a clear attempt to curb cryptocurrency transactions. The Impact on traders and retail investors “The 1% TDS (tax deducted at source) doesn’t make high-frequency trading viable in India anymore. Traders lose 1% capital on each sale,” says Anoush Bhasin, a crypto tax adviser and founder of Quagmire Consulting. The data confirms it:  The introduction of these taxes  combined with the bear market has caused the volumes on major exchanges to drop significantly. As a result, traders are forced to make more calculated decisions, factoring in the impact of taxes on the success of their trades. That they can’t offset their losing trades against their winning ones is the nail in the coffin. “Furthermore, the TDS compliance burden makes filings very complex.” Bhasin added. “There is no regulatory clarity on TDS for decentralized exchanges, non-custodial wallets or custodial exchanges.” There has been a significant shift amongst some crypto holders in India to a long-term holding mindset so as to avoid taxes – or at least make paying taxes worth it. “India has drastically switched laws before, and the ones holding throughout the 2018-2020 ban were the ones who were the most benefited,” speculated a trader who wishes to remain anonymous. “At least my family doesn’t think I’m involved in something illegal now.” The impact on new and existing crypto businesses Blockchain consultants and lawyers are noticing a significant brain drain from India and an overall preference to set up shop in nations that are more crypto friendly. “Existing businesses have moved overseas in the search for less complicated regulations,” said Bhasin. That includes major players such as the founders of crypto exchange WazirX and blockchain Polygon who have both relocated to Dubai. “Over 40% of my blockchain clients have moved out of India, with Malta and Singapore being preferred destinations,” Vijay Pal Dalmia, an adviser for crypto businesses and an advocate in the Supreme Court of India, said. A  new ITR  (tax) draft proposed by the Indian government may target companies and individuals that have moved abroad but still have business ties to India. The new proposal requires foreign entities and individuals to disclose investments in India. “If this ITR draft [targets us], we would be forced to consider the possibility of disabling our crypto offerings for India. Of course, that wouldn’t be our first option,” said Aayushi Jain, co-founder of ZeroSwap, a Singapore-based decentralized exchange that has a lot of users in India. The impact of the new regulations also depends on the specific type of business. Some companies have resorted to workarounds that allow them to accept crypto payments. “For crypto payments, we use payroll systems such as Ontop that deposit Indian currency to [a] bank account within three days,” said Uddalak Das, a crypto marketing consultant. However, using such payment systems introduces a middleman – the very thing crypto aims to eliminate. “The [majority of the] entities left operating in India are back-end tech or support service providers, which can deal simply in fiat and have no touchpoint with crypto,” Bhasin said. Looking to the future Most experts agree that India’s current tax laws hurt crypto and are regressive in nature. Changpeng Zhao, CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange, recently said that high taxes could “kill the industry” in India. And yet,  India’s presidency of the Group of 20 nations in 2023  and its continued emphasis on crypto regulation indicate that the country will play a big role in framing global crypto policies. Whether the agenda is to call for a global ban on cryptocurrencies or to provide a regulatory framework where innovation can thrive remains to be seen.",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/14/india-cryptocurrency-tax-laws/,coindesk,2022-11-14,14:15:00,en,1569,9808,5.242192479286169,600,0.3824091778202677,current fiscal ending financial

binance,Opinion,Let's Stop Regulating Crypto Exchanges Like Western Union,"The collapse of cryptocurrency exchange FTX has been gut-wrenching for its customers, not only those who used its flagship offshore exchange in the Bahamas but also U.S. customers of Chicago-based FTX US. But there is a silver lining to the FTX debacle. It may put an end to the way that cryptocurrency exchanges are regulated – or, more accurately, misregulated – in the U.S. U.S.-based cryptocurrency exchanges including Coinbase, FTX US, and  Binance.US  are overseen on a state-by-state basis as money transmitters. Money transmitter regulation first emerged in the early 1900s with so-called ""immigrant banks."" Agents  would collect funds  from local immigrant communities in places like New York City and forward it by steamship to their families back in Europe and elsewhere. J.P. Koning, a CoinDesk columnist, worked as an equity researcher at a Canadian brokerage firm and a financial writer at a large Canadian bank. He runs the popular Moneyness blog. To protect immigrants from fraudsters, states began to impose licensing requirements on money transmission agents. Each state (except Montana) has evolved its own set of money transmitter laws. Household names like Western Union and MoneyGram are regulated as money transmitters. Oddly, PayPal was stuffed into this framework in the early 2000s. (It  currently boasts  money transmitter licenses from 49 states). And then, in the 2010s, crypto exchanges were subsumed under it. (Coinbase  has 45 of them .) Later, stablecoins like USD coin were anointed as money transmitters. In essence, money transmission has become the go-to bin for a motley crew of ""new financial things that people are using that we don't know how to regulate."" The problem is that the public protections afforded by money transmitter law are inadequate. Dan Awrey, a professor at Cornell University,  has documented  some of these failings, which include lax bond security requirements, tiny capital requirements, an insufficient ""ring fencing"" of customer funds in the case of bankruptcy and an overly permissive list of investments to which transmitters can deploy their customers' funds. Read more:  Illia Polosukhin  -  Crypto Didn’t Fail FTX; People Did The inclusion of crypto exchanges under the money transmitter framework is particularly perplexing. Exchanges like FTX US and Coinbase offer brokerage services and liquid marketplaces for trading. In many cases, these exchanges store a significant chunk of customer’s life savings, for long periods of time. Brokerage and trading are typically the domain of beefier federal agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), which have far stricter rules than money transmission agencies, particularly around custody. So, to review, crypto exchanges are being regulated in the same manner as the neighborhood money transfer shop, which typically only handles small $200 cash transfers and rarely holds customer funds longer than overnight. The unfortunate failure of one of these money transmitters, West Realm Shires Services Inc., may be the final straw for this rickety arrangement. West Realm Shires Services is the official name for FTX US, a large spot exchange that serves around 1 million Americans. On its website, FTX US  lists the  40 money transmission licenses it has been awarded. For states where it has no licenses, like California, FTX US presumably uses a rent-a-license agreement, whereby it contracts with a third party to ride shotgun under its licenses. When Sam Bankman-Fried’s 160-company FTX octopus  was put into bankruptcy  last week, the FTX US spot exchange was one of the entities that found itself on the list. Not only are customers of FTX US embroiled in what could very well become a multiyear bankruptcy process. Thanks to the patchy protection that money transmitter licenses afford to FTX US customers, there is a good chance that when this process finally winds up, customers also won't get their money back. The bankruptcy status of FTX US stands in sharp contrast to those parts of FTX's U.S. operations that are regulated by the SEC and CFTC. FTX Capital Markets and Embed Clearing, which are both overseen by the SEC, remain solvent and are not listed as debtors in last week's  bankruptcy filing . Neither is FTX-owned LedgerX, which offers crypto derivatives and operates under CFTC oversight. Time to get exchanges like Coinbase under a more appropriate regulatory umbrella before additional damage is done. It's too early, to be sure, but it appears that something about these three subsidiaries' SEC and CFTC oversight has afforded them – and their customers – enough protection to stay solvent. In a different world, one where the FTX US exchange was regulated by the CFTC and SEC, might FTX US and its one million customers have been likewise spared? It's very possible. Things didn't have to be this way. For two years now, SEC Chair Gary Gensler  has been politely asking  crypto exchanges like FTX US to submit to SEC oversight. But FTX US didn't listen. Nor did any of FTX US’ competitors. They kept coasting on their money transmitter licenses. And now FTX US customers appear to be in trouble. While exchanges certainly bear part of the blame for not complying, so does Gensler for not pushing hard enough for exchanges to come in and register. There’s an easy fix. It's time for U.S. crypto exchanges to face the same rules as non-crypto marketplaces and brokers. There's precedent for this in Canada. After the massive QuadrigaCX failure in 2019, securities regulators forced all Canadian crypto exchanges  to register with  watchdogs such as the Ontario Securities Commission, the closest thing that Canada has to the SEC. Canadian dollar balances at one exchange, Coinsquare, are  even protected  by the Canadian Investor Protection Fund (CIPF), the Canadian equivalent of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), which provides insurance to customers of failed broker-dealers. This new and much more robust framework seems to have kept Canadians safe from a FTX-type failure. FTX International and FTX US, for instance, have been refusing to onboard Canadian customers for over a year now, much to Canadians’ benefit. Arrayed against the idea of putting crypto exchanges under SEC or CFTC oversight are exchange executives, and you can see why. The local money transmission examiner is never going to be strict as a Federal securities watchdog. Oddly, some crypto critics are also insisting that crypto exchanges remain unregulated. Economists Stephen Cecchetti and Kermit Schoenholtz, for instance, recently argued that post-FTX, the world should  just let crypto burn . To regulate crypto would be to grant it unwarranted legitimacy, they say. The problem with the let-it-burn view is that crypto has crashed and burned many times. Each time it roars back, only for more retail customers to lose all their funds to the next Mt Gox, Quadriga, or FTX US. Time to get exchanges like FTX US and its competitors, including Coinbase, under a more appropriate regulatory umbrella before additional damage is done. Exchanges aren’t money transmitters, and shouldn’t be regulated as such. They’re much more than that.",https://www.coindesk.com/layer2/2022/11/22/lets-stop-regulating-crypto-exchanges-like-western-union/,coindesk,2022-11-22,21:31:00,en,1147,7241,5.292938099389712,433,0.37750653879686136,collapse cryptocurrency exchange ftx gut wrenching customer flagship offshore exchange bahamas customer chicago based ftx lining ftx debacle put end cryptocurrency exchange regulated accurately misregulated based cryptocurrency exchange including coinbase ftx binance overseen state state basis transmitter transmitter regulation emerged called immigrant agent collect fund local immigrant community place city forward steamship family europe koning coindesk columnist worked equity researcher canadian brokerage firm financial writer canadian bank run popular moneyness blog protect immigrant fraudsters state began impose licensing requirement transmission agent state evolved set transmitter household name western union moneygram regulated transmitter oddly paypal stuffed framework boast transmitter license state crypto exchange subsumed coinbase stablecoins usd coin anointed transmitter essence transmission bin crew financial thing people regulate problem public protection afforded transmitter inadequate awrey professor university documented failing include lax security requirement capital requirement insufficient fencing customer fund bankruptcy overly permissive list investment transmitter deploy customer fund illia polosukhin crypto fail ftx people inclusion crypto exchange transmitter framework perplexing exchange ftx coinbase offer brokerage service liquid marketplace trading case exchange store significant chunk customer life saving period time brokerage trading typically domain beefier federal agency security exchange commission sec commodity future trading commission cftc stricter rule transmission agency custody review crypto exchange regulated manner neighborhood transfer shop typically handle transfer rarely hold customer fund longer overnight unfortunate failure transmitter realm shire service final straw rickety arrangement realm shire service official ftx spot exchange serf american website ftx list transmission license awarded state license california ftx rent license agreement contract party ride shotgun license bankman company ftx octopus put bankruptcy ftx spot exchange entity found list customer ftx embroiled multiyear bankruptcy process patchy protection transmitter license afford ftx customer process finally wind customer bankruptcy status ftx stand contrast part ftx operation regulated sec cftc ftx capital market embed clearing overseen sec remain solvent listed debtor bankruptcy filing ftx owned ledgerx offer crypto derivative operates cftc oversight time exchange coinbase regulatory umbrella additional damage appears subsidiary sec cftc oversight afforded customer protection stay solvent world ftx exchange regulated cftc sec ftx customer likewise spared thing year sec chair gensler politely crypto exchange ftx submit sec oversight ftx listen ftx competitor coasting transmitter license ftx customer trouble exchange part blame complying gensler pushing hard exchange easy time crypto exchange face rule crypto marketplace broker precedent massive quadrigacx failure security regulator forced canadian crypto exchange watchdog ontario security commission closest thing sec canadian balance exchange coinsquare protected canadian investor protection fund cipf canadian equivalent security investor protection corporation sipc insurance customer failed broker dealer robust framework canadian safe ftx type failure ftx international ftx instance refusing onboard canadian customer canadian benefit arrayed idea putting crypto exchange sec cftc oversight exchange executive local transmission examiner strict federal security watchdog oddly crypto critic insisting crypto exchange remain unregulated economist cecchetti schoenholtz instance recently argued ftx world crypto burn regulate crypto unwarranted legitimacy problem burn view crypto crashed burned time time roar retail customer lose fund mt gox quadriga ftx time exchange ftx competitor including coinbase regulatory umbrella additional damage exchange transmitter regulated,-0.05714285714285714,negative,0.4482142857142858,"{'neg': 0.114, 'neu': 0.807, 'pos': 0.079, 'compound': -0.9686}",-0.9686,0.114,0.807,0.079,negative,-0.8064515868886585,0.06709956695432995,negative
binance,Profile,Who Is Alameda's Former co-CEO Sam Trabucco?,"Former co-CEO of Alameda Research One of the firm's first hires, who oversaw the development of ever-riskier trading strategies Retired in early 2022 When Sam Trabucco  stepped down  as co-CEO of trading firm Alameda Research in August, he tweeted, ""But if I've learned anything at Alameda, it's how to make good decisions – and this is the right one for me."" In hindsight, it seems like impeccable timing for Trabucco to quit a high-stress job to spend time on his newly purchased boat – mere months before the company would go under water. See also:  Who's Who in the FTX Inner Circle It only took  10 days  for Sam Bankman-Fried's crypto empire to go from processing withdrawals, albeit slowly, to declaring bankruptcy. This followed a  CoinDesk report  in November showing that, for all intents and purposes, Alameda Research, which had $8 billion of liabilities and $14.6 billion in assets, was insolvent. The hedge fund Trabucco ran likely came to own many of its illiquid altcoins during his tenure. This includes the inexplicably large amount of FTT, the exchange token for Alameda’s sister company, FTX. Trabucco joined Alameda as a trader in 2019 after a stint as a quant trader on Susquehanna International Group’s bond desk. He was appointed co-CEO in October 2021 with Caroline Ellison, after his friend-cum-boss Bankman-Fried resigned in  an attempt to distance  the SBF-owned trading firm from the SBF-controlled trading platform. “He is not really involved in day-to-day operations in Alameda. Caroline and I have been leading the charge there for quite some time,”  Trabucco told CoinDesk  at the time. Trabucco met Bankman-Fried during a five week math camp at Mount Holyoke College in 2010, according to  Insider . He recalled that Bankman-Fried barely slept during their stay. The two reunited at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where Trabucco received his bachelor’s degrees in math and computer science. As co-CEO, Trabucco helped oversee Alameda’s expansion beyond its initial market-neutral, but relatively low-profit business as a market maker for low-volume cryptocurrencies into riskier trading strategies, according to a Twitter thread detailing that shift. For instance, he said Alameda traders began exploring  yield farming  in decentralized finance (DeFi). Eventually, according to Trabucco’s account, the trading firm began taking in  “huge” profits  placing highly leveraged bets on assets like dogecoin after noticing its price went up whenever Elon Musk  tweeted  about the meme coin. Although the full story is not yet known, emerging evidence suggests Alameda suffered a series of losses during the beginning of the crypto market downturn. Ellison did not include Trabucco among a list of named persons who knew about the decision to send customer funds to Alameda, as reported by the  Wall Street Journal.

binance,Tech,Alameda-Backed Crypto Trading Firm 3Commas Says It’s Pretty Sure It Wasn’t Breached,"Over a dozen users of the crypto trading service 3Commas, which was backed by Sam Bankman-Fried’s Alameda Research, say the platform leaked their credentials and enabled attackers to run away with over $6 million in user funds. The platform’s CEO has called these allegations “false rumors,” stating that those who lost their funds have been phished – meaning they accidentally shared their credentials with an exploiter. But in an interview with CoinDesk on Monday, 3Commas Deputy Chief Technology Officer Artem Koltsov walked back the company’s unequivocal claim that every user who lost money was the victim of phishing or input-stealing. “The very disappointing thing here is that nothing can be told for sure,” said Koltsov. “We know that there is phishing out there. We know that anything could happen with those API keys. We're not happy about it."" Neither side is able to prove its argument definitively: Just as 3Commas can’t state for certain that it was never the victim of a hack, its users can’t prove that they never accidentally shared their API keys. But amid all the confusion, conflicting statements from 3Commas have invited more questions than answers. What happened 3Commas, which is based in Estonia and calls itself the “largest automatic crypto trading platform,” claims in its Twitter bio that it processes $23 billion in monthly volume. CoinDesk reported  in September that it raised $37 million in Series B funding from Target Global, Jump Crypto and Alameda Research – the SBF-linked trading firm that imploded earlier this month along with Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. The bread and butter of 3Commas is its trading bots – programs that automatically execute trades for users on exchange platforms like Binance, Coinbase and FTX. In order for a 3Commas bot to execute trades on a platform like Coinbase, the user must give 3Commas an API key – secret credentials generated by the exchange which grant third-party platforms, like 3Commas, permission to trade on a user’s behalf. Starting in October, several 3Commas users noticed that their accounts on Binance, Coinbase, FTX and OKX had been ransacked. “I had an email from Coinbase saying, ‘Your account has been locked because of a security issue,’” recalled one 3Commas user, a U.K.-based entrepreneur, in an interview with CoinDesk. “I managed to go through their self-recovery process, which took about six hours. I got into the account and I could see that it’d been compromised.” “There were dozens and dozens and dozens of trades,” the user said. “Basically, they used my API details to sell all of my assets into a low-cap, low-liquidity coin.” Altogether, this user says, he lost $200,000 to the exploit. Over a dozen users claimed to have been the victims of similar attacks, which happened in waves throughout October and November. In communications reviewed by CoinDesk, Help Desk agents at Binance and Coinbase confirmed to several users that their accounts had been drained by hackers via their 3Commas API keys. After the first wave of attacks in mid-October, 3Commas published a  blog post  confirming that some of its users’ API keys had been stolen. According to the firm, the API keys had been used to steal over $6 million – a number that would have increased with subsequent attacks in November. 3Commas said that an internal investigation found no evidence, however, that its platform had been breached. Instead, the firm concluded that users must have inadvertently shared their API credentials with phishing websites. “The most typical phishing scam, which was the case with the one under discussion today, involves impersonating a legitimate company via email or other means and getting the user to click on a cloned website that closely resembles the interface the user is familiar with but with a slightly different URL,” wrote 3Commas CEO Yuri Sorokin. “The user enters their log-in details, and then significant stress and pain are experienced by that user and the legitimate service they’re trying to interact with.” Rumors of a 3Commas leak Not everyone bought 3Commas' explanation for what happened, and rumors started to circulate online that 3Commas was using the story of a “phishing scam” to cover up an exploit. Speculation of something more sordid grew louder on Nov. 14, when Changpeng “CZ” Zhao, the CEO of Binance, the world’s largest crypto exchange by volume, referenced 3Commas in a  tweet : “We [sic] seen at least 3 cases of users who shared their API key with 3rd party platforms (Skyrex and 3commas), and seen unexpected trading on their accounts. If you used such a platform before, I highly recommend you to delete your API keys just to be safe.” Sorokin addressed the leak rumors in a Nov. 15 blog post titled, “RE: False Rumors of API Leaks or Exposure of our Database.” At the top of the post, he reiterated that “3Commas traders are safe.” As for the rumor that the platform had been breached, Sorokin called it “a completely baseless accusation being floated by individuals on social media who don’t understand how API key encryption actually works.” This particular statement rubbed several 3Commas users who’d lost funds the wrong way. Users who believe their credentials had been leaked by the firm organized themselves into a Telegram group. Many in the 18-person group claimed to be seasoned crypto users, and at least two identified as software engineers. All of those with whom CoinDesk spoke insisted they found no 3Commas phishing sites in their browser histories. Group members with whom CoinDesk spoke say they also took added precautions – like bookmarking the official 3Commas site and configuring two-factor authentication to secure their accounts. Phishing scams typically work by tricking users into copying and pasting sensitive credentials onto a spoof site. One Turkish engineer who lost $300,000 to the 3Commas API incident said that he connected his Binance exchange account to 3Commas using a “Fast API” service.  According to Binance , the Fast API service removes the copy-paste step entirely – it would have connected 3Commas to Binance without requiring the user to manually input his API code. If this user never manually pasted API credentials anywhere, as he claims in the Telegram group, it is less clear how he could have been phished. “[3Commas has] known about this for up to a month and they could have taken more decisive action,” the U.K. entrepreneur told CoinDesk. “They have put out blog posts without any direct warnings, and all of the warnings are the party line that customers have been phished for their API details. But their claim just doesn't stand up.” Members of the “3Commas Leak Issue” group have begun to flood the company’s Discord server, Twitter page, and Telegram groups with questions, requests for more transparency, and allegations that the platform has acted dishonestly. 3Commas, for its part, banned some disgruntled users from its Discord and has started closing down Telegram chats circulating rumors that the platform was breached. “We are now obliged to close Telegram group chats as we can see that some members proving [sic] the misleading and false information, which is a criminal offence,” Sorokin  tweeted . Setting the record straight As users continue to hound 3Commas with questions, the firm appears to be backing off its assertion that phishing was the only explanation for how users lost their funds. In a  Nov. 18 tweet , 3Commas’ first stance was unequivocal: “Over the past month, there have been multiple incidents of unauthorized trades on partner exchanges. We’ve identified that these users’ API keys were accessed through a variety of phishing and input-stealing methods.” To back up its claim that the attack was the result of phishing rather than a leak, 3Commas posted  screenshots to its blog  showing that dozens of spoofed versions of its site had proliferated in recent weeks. Several of these phishing sites were apparently promoted to the top of Google above the real 3Commas site – a disappointingly common tactic in the world of crypto-phishing scams. But in his interview with CoinDesk later this week, Kortsov was more circumspect about what actually happened. “We cannot be 100% sure. We definitely know that there are phishing sites out there. But also, whenever you ask the user, most of them will say … ‘I have never dropped my keys anywhere’” As for the denials from users, “there’s no way to check it at all,” said Kortsov. The 3Commas API saga is ongoing. Both sides seem convinced that they are in the right, but neither can produce evidence definitively proving what happened. 3Commas has encouraged users to generate new API codes out of precaution, and it says that it updated its app to make future phishing scams more difficult to pull off. In a statement shared with CoinDesk, 3Commas’ legal team said the firm was in the process of hiring outside experts to review its code and settle things definitively for users. In the meantime, they said, “Only a miniscule fraction of users reported abnormal activity to 3Commas. 99.9% of the API keys stored in 3Commas database have not been impacted by the attacks.” But the legal team, like Koltsov, stopped short of making blanket claims that users were phished. According to the statement, 3Commas maintains it is not to blame for the stolen funds “to our best current knowledge.”",https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2022/11/23/alameda-backed-crypto-trading-firm-3commas-says-its-pretty-sure-it-wasnt-breached/,coindesk,2022-11-23,13:15:00,en,1539,9374,5.085769980506822,623,0.4048083170890188,dozen

binance, News , OpenSea’s Seaport Protocol onboards creators and NFT holders on BNB Chain ,"Crypto collectibles and  nonfungible token (NFT)  marketplace OpenSea has announced plans to integrate BNB Chain on its Web3 NFT marketplace protocol by the end of 2022. The integration with Seaport Protocol will allow users to buy, list and trade BNB Chain NFTs on OpenSea. BNB Chain was built by Binance to operate as a Web3-focused blockchain network powered by the exchange's in-house token, BNB ( BNB ). BNB Chain’s integration into OpenSea's Seaport Protocol aims to provide BNB Chain creators with multiple creator payouts, real-time payouts and collection management, among others. Gwendolyn Regina, investment director at BNB Chain, said the intent is to deliver better experiences to NFT creators and users. She added: “The integration will bring a large number of creators into the wider system, as well as empower the creators and NFT initiatives inside the BNB Chain ecosystem.” The integration aims to lower gas fees, provide easier signature confirmation actions and eliminate setup fees. In addition to BNB Chain, OpenSea plans to leverage Seaport across multiple blockchains to reach more users.  Related:  Binance sees record 138K BTC inflows as opinions differ on what Bitcoin price will do next OpenSea recently confirmed  to continue enforcing royalties across all collections  after receiving significant public backlash for considering otherwise. The community pushback came after OpenSea announced the launch of an on-chain tool that would allow creators to enforce royalties for any new collections on the platform but stopped short of offering the same to existing collections. The on-chain tool, as described by OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer as a “simple code snippet,” was aimed at taking over the existing system of voluntary creator fee payment. The code would also restrict NFT sales to only marketplaces that enforce creator fees criteria. In January 2022, OpenSea also had to  backtrack on its attempt to impose limits  on NFT mints after a community outcry. The platform had tried to limit creators to making just five NFT collections with a maximum of 50 items each. Well… For instance, I committed myself to a 100 piece collection.

binance,Policy,"Binance, Coinbase Among Crypto Firms Questioned by US Senator After FTX Mess","Binance.US  and Coinbase (COIN) are on a list of crypto companies questioned this week by the chairman of the U.S. Senate Finance Committee about how they protect the investors using their services in light of the widespread damage caused by the fall of FTX. Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sent  letters to six CEOs of prominent cryptocurrency firms  – including Bitfinex, Gemini, Kraken and KuCoin – asking them to explain their structures, whether they separate customers’ assets from their own and how they guard against market manipulation and internal conflicts of interest. “As Congress considers much-needed regulations for the crypto industry, I will focus on the clear need for consumer protections along the lines of the assurances that have long existed for customers of banks, credit unions and securities brokers,” Wyden said in the letters. “If these protections had been in place before the failure of FTX, far fewer retail investors would be facing precipitous financial harm today.” The letters – dated Nov. 28 – request balance-sheet information and explanations for the companies’ reserves, including whether they’re audited. While it’s unlikely the companies – most of them private and a couple of them based overseas – will provide detailed financial data, the requests underline Democratic lawmakers’ possible approach to the industry as the next session of Congress gets rolling in about a month. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) and Richard Durbin (D-Ill.)  have begun probing FTX , calling for those responsible to be held accountable for their roles in the crypto exchange’s collapse. Wyden’s committee isn’t core to some of the central regulatory questions facing the industry in the U.S., but his authority over tax issues could play an important part. The Oregon senator had previously been  critical of crypto miners , although he’d also pushed for  crypto-friendly changes  to the 2021 infrastructure bill that shook the industry.",https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2022/11/29/binance-coinbase-among-crypto-firms-questioned-by-us-senator-after-ftx-mess/,coindesk,2022-11-29,19:46:00,en,309,1983,5.398058252427185,115,0.37216828478964403,binance coinbase coin list crypto company questioned chairman senate finance committee protect investor service widespread damage caused fall ftx sen wyden ore letter ceo prominent cryptocurrency firm including bitfinex gemini kraken kucoin explain structure separate customer asset guard market manipulation internal conflict interest congress considers needed regulation crypto industry focus clear consumer protection line assurance existed customer credit union security broker wyden letter protection failure ftx fewer retail investor facing precipitous financial harm today letter dated request balance sheet information explanation company reserve including audited company private couple based overseas provide detailed financial data request underline democratic lawmaker approach industry session congress rolling sen mass ill begun probing ftx calling responsible accountable role crypto exchange collapse wyden committee central regulatory question facing industry authority tax issue play important part oregon senator previously critical crypto miner pushed crypto friendly infrastructure industry,0.0638888888888889,positive,0.48722222222222217,"{'neg': 0.139, 'neu': 0.68, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.6369}",0.6369,0.139,0.68,0.181,positive,-0.5384614970414233,0.09923664046384244,negative
binance, News ," Trader allegedly saw over 5,000x gains after Ankr protocol hack ","When the BNB Chain-based protocol Ankr was exploited and a hacker dumped Ankr Reward Bearing Staked BNB (aBNBc) tokens, a trader took advantage of the price discrepancies and turned $2,879 into $15.5 million.  As previously reported by Cointelegraph, security firm Beosin suggested that the  multimillion-dollar exploit  may have come from vulnerabilities in the smart contract code and compromised private keys due to a technical upgrade. After the hacker minted and dumped 20 trillion aBNBc tokens, the price of aBNBc significantly dropped. As this happened, a trader reacted quickly and took advantage of an opportunity. Going through on-chain data, analysis platform Lookonchain recently shared how a trader allegedly managed to gain $15.5 million by making their way through the Helio Protocol platform. According to Lookonchain, the trader bought 183,885 aBNBc with only 10 BNB ( BNB ) after the Ankr exploiter dumped the aBNBc.  After this, the trader deposited the aBNBc into Helio Protocol and used the funds as collateral to borrow 16 million HAY tokens. In the end, the trader exchanged the HAY for 15.5 million Binance USD (BUSD), earning a 5,209x profit from their original capital.  Apart from losses sustained from the trade, the exploit may have also affected Helio’s total value locked. Before the attack, the HAY stablecoin had around $87 million in TVL. However, at the time of writing, the  decentralized finance  data tracker DefiLlama  shows  that HAY now has $0 in TVL.  In an announcement to its community, Helio Protocol assured users that their assets were safe and that all of their staked BNB is within the validators. At present, the protocol has  suspended  all its functions and asked HAY holders to refrain from any transactions.  Related:  After FTX: DeFi can go mainstream if it overcomes its flaws After recently asking  decentralized exchanges  to halt trading, Ankr mentioned that it will be reissuing aBNBc tokens. The platform promised that it will assess the situation and compensate affected users.  Additional details:  We have been in touch with the DEXes and told them to block trading. We will reissue tokens in the future after we assess the situation. — Ankr (@ankr)  December 2, 2022

binance,Business,Crypto Exchange Coinbase Asks Users to Switch USDT for USDC,"Coinbase is waiving the conversion fees for users who wish to switch to a ""trusted stablecoin"" in a new campaign that highlights the quality of reserves that back Circle-owned USD coin (USDC). ""The events of the past few weeks have put some stablecoins to the test and we’ve seen a flight to safety,"" Coinbase said in blog post published Friday morning Asia time. ""We believe that USD coin (USDC) is a trusted and reputable stablecoin."" Coinbase said starting today it's waiving fees for global retail customers to convert tether (USDT) to USDC. Coinbase is a co-founder of USDC. On-chain data shows that USDT is the third-most widely traded digital asset on Coinbase, representing 5% of the volume on the exchange,  where it currently trades  for 99 cents. Days after the FTX collapse , USDT was knocked off its peg and traded as low as 93 cents. The majority of trading pairs on exchanges have returned to $1,  though CoinGecko data shows  that USDT continues to trade at 99 cents on some pairs at Binance. In late September , the issuing company, Tether, was ordered by a federal court judge in New York to produce financial records relating to the backing of USDT. This is separate from the  lawsuit before the New York Supreme Court  (where CoinDesk is a party to the proceedings) that's asking for the New York Attorney General to release documents it gathered in its investigation into Tether’s reserves.

binance,Business,Binance CEO Changpeng 'CZ' Zhao Warns Staff of Turbulent Times ,"Binance Chief Executive Officer Changpeng ""CZ"" Zhao has warned his staff to expect turbulent times ahead as the giant crypto exchange sees a wave of crypto outflows amid concerns about its financial health, according to an internal memo. ""While we expect the next several months to be bumpy, we will get past this challenging period – and we'll be stronger for having been through it,"" CZ wrote to his staff. Bloomberg had earlier reported on the memo from CZ, which CoinDesk subsequently confirmed. Binance saw  crypto withdrawals worth more than $900 million early this week as users took direct custody of their coins in the wake of widespread criticism of the exchanges' audit report published last week.

binance, News , BNB insurance for Binance listing? CZ addresses delisted project’s claims  ,"A decentralized social network project called Mithril (MITH) was recently delisted from Binance and in return, the crypto project asked for the 200,000 BNB ( BNB ) it had to deposit as insurance for listing on the exchange. Binance CEO Changpeng “CZ” Zhao responded to MITH’s demand on Twitter with a screenshot of their contract that suggests if the listed token price falls below a certain threshold, the exchange has the right to deduct the insurance fund partially or fully as an additional fee. CZ said that the said project’s token price fell below the trigger threshold on multiple occasions and after looking at the project, it hasn’t updated the community for almost two years. CZ claimed that the “team has made the right decision and acted fully within our right to do so.” Your token price is way below the trigger levels. Reading the comments. Your website is offline. You haven’t tweeted or updated your community for almost 2 years. I believe our team has made the right decision and acted fully within our right to do so. Regards. 2/2 — CZ  Binance (@cz_binance)  December 16, 2022 
 
 The MITH project was founded by Jeff Huang, a famed Taiwanese musician and a popular nonfungible token (NFT) investor. The founder of the project has a tainted crypto record with on-chain analyst ZachXBT,  accusing  him of embezzling 22,000 Ether ( ETH ). Related:  CryptoQuant verifies Binance's reserves, reports no ‘FTX-like’ behavior The exchange between the Binance CEO and a delisted project grabbed the crypto community’s attention. Many in the crypto community were quick to point out that the MITH project has been non-existent since early 2021 and the listing insurance of 200K BNB was only valued at $2 million at the time of deposit against its current market value of $53 million. Mithril's ($MITH,  @mithdotio ) last tweet was in January 2021 (!!!). The team just abandoned the project and is now requiring listing fees back from  #Binance  . LOL.

 Many others questioned whether it was fair for the exchange to ask for security insurance in Binance’s native token to get listed. Another user  questioned  whether Binance’s focus on delisting based on the price of the token is the right approach, given “if the price has such a huge weightage it would push projects to pump/dump or artificially inflate prices every time it goes below trigger price?” A Binance spokesperson told Cointelegraph: ""The deposit amount and terms were mutually agreed in 2018, we also previously clarified these matters with the MITH leadership team, which they acknowledged and accepted.""

binance, News ," CryptoQuant verifies Binance's reserves, reports no ‘FTX-like’ behavior ","Blockchain analytics provider CryptoQuant has released a report analyzing the recently released proof-of-reserves audit of the world’s largest crypto exchange, Binance. Centralized exchanges have been cast into the spotlight over the past month following the collapse of FTX, none more so than Binance, which has been  scrambling to reassure customers and investors  that it has sufficient reserves and is fully backed. A  report  by CryptoQuant released on Dec. 14 says its analysis confirms that Binance's reserves are accounted for.  Earlier this month, Binance released a proof-of-reserves report  but it was criticized  as being an “agreed-upon procedure” and not a full audit. Additionally, the report didn’t address the effectiveness of internal financial controls, according to the former chief of the Securities Exchange Commission's Office of Internet Enforcement, John Reed Stark. But CryptoQuant has backed the findings of audit firm Mazars, stating that liabilities reported by Binance are very close to its estimation of 99%. “The report shows Binance’s BTC liabilities (customers deposits) are 97% collateralized by the exchange assets. Collateralization increases to 101% when the BTC lent to customers is accounted for.” What does Binance's Proof of Reserve (PoR) report tell us from an on-chain perspective?

 The analytics firm added that on-chain data suggests thatBinance’s Ether ( ETH ) and stablecoin reserves are “not showing 'FTX-like' behavior at this point.” “Additionally, Binance has an acceptable ‘Clean Reserve,’ which means its own token,  BNB , is still a low proportion of its total assets,” it reported.  According to data provider  Nansen , around 10% of Binance reserves are held in its token. Binance currently holds $60.4 billion in total assets in its publicly disclosed addresses, and $6.2 billion of that total was BNB ( BNB ), Nansen reported.

binance, Opinion , Algorithmic stabilization is the key to effective crypto-finance ,"After the collapse of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, Terra (LUNA), and its stablecoin, Terra (UST), the notion of “algorithmic stabilization” has fallen to a low point in popularity, both in the cryptocurrency world and among mainstream observers. This emotional response, however, is strongly at odds with reality. In fact, algorithmic stabilization of digital assets is a highly valuable and important class of mechanism whose appropriate deployment will be critical if the crypto sphere is to meet its long-term goal of improving the mainstream financial system. Blockchains, and other similar data structures for secure decentralized computing networks, are not only about money. Due to the historical roots of blockchain tech in Bitcoin ( BTC ), however, the theme of blockchain-based digital money is woven deep into the ecosystem. Since its inception, a core aspiration of the blockchain space has been the creation of cryptocurrencies that can serve as media of payment and stores of values, independently of the “fiat currencies” created, defended and manipulated by national governments. Related:  Developers could have prevented crypto’s 2022 hacks if they took basic security measures So far, however, the crypto world has failed rather miserably at fulfilling its original aspiration of producing tokens that are superior to fiat currency for payment or for value storage. In fact, this aspiration is eminently fulfillable — but to achieve it in a tractable way requires creative use of algorithmic stabilization, the same sort of mechanism LUNA and other Ponzi-esque projects have abused and thus given an unjustly bad reputation. Nearly all crypto tokens out there today disqualify themselves as broadly useful tools for payment or value storage for multiple reasons — they are too slow and costly to transact with, and their exchange values are too volatile.  The “slow and costly” problem is gradually being addressed by improvements in underlying technology.  The volatility problem is not caused directly by technological shortcomings but rather by market dynamics. The crypto markets are not that huge relative to the size of global financial systems, and they are heavily traded by speculators, which causes exchange rates to swing wildly up and down.  The best solutions the crypto world has found to this volatility issue so far are “stablecoins,” which are cryptocurrencies with values pinned to fiat currencies like the United States dollar or euro. But there are fundamentally better solutions to be found that avoid any dependency on fiat and bring other advantages via using algorithmic stabilization in judicious (and non-corrupt) ways. Troubles with stablecoins Stablecoins like Tether ( USDT ), BinanceUSD (BUSD) and USD Coin ( USDC ) have values tied close to that of USD, which means they can be used as a store of value almost as reliably as an ordinary bank account. For people already doing business in the crypto world, there is utility in having wealth stored in a stable form within one’s crypto wallet, so one can easily shift it back and forth between the stable form and various other crypto products.  The largest and most popular stablecoins are “fully backed,” meaning, for example, that each dollar-equivalent unit of USDC corresponds to one U.S. dollar stored in the treasury of the organization backing USDC. So if everyone holding a unit of USDC asked to exchange it for a USD at the same time, the organization would be able to rapidly fulfill all the requests.  Some stablecoins are fractionally backed, meaning that if, say, $100 million in stablecoins have been issued, there may be only $70 million in the corresponding treasury backing it up. In that case, if 70% of the stablecoin holders redeemed their tokens, things would be fine. But if 80% redeemed their tokens, it would become a problem. For FRAX and other similar stablecoins, algorithmic stabilization methods are used to “maintain the peg.” That is, to make sure the exchange value of the stablecoin remains very close to that of the USD peg.  Terra’s UST was an example of a stablecoin whose backing reserve consisted largely of tokens created by the people behind LUNA as governance tokens for their platform, rather than USD or even cryptocurrencies like BTC or Ether ( ETH ) defined independently of LUNA. When LUNA began to destabilize, the perceived value of their governance token went down, which meant the cash value of their reserves decreased, which caused further destabilization, etc. While LUNA did use algorithmic stabilization, the core problem with their set-up was not this — it was the presence of vicious circularities in their tokenomics, such as the use of their own governance token as a backing reserve. Like most other flexible financial mechanisms, algorithmic stabilization can be manipulated.  Every major government is explicitly targeting stablecoins in their current regulatory exercises, with the goal of coming up with strict regulations on the issuance and properties of any crypto token that seeks to match the value of fiat currency. The answer to all these issues is a relatively simple one: Utilize the flexibility of blockchain-based smart-contract infrastructure to create new financial instruments that achieve useful forms of stability without pegging to fiat. Liberating algorithmic stabilization “Stability” does not intrinsically mean correlation with fiat currency value. What it should mean for a token to be stable is that year on year, it should cost roughly the same number of tokens to buy the same amount of stuff — carrots, chickens, fencing material, rare earths, accounting services, whatever.  This leads to what my colleagues in the Cogito project are doing, with new tokens that they call “tracercoins,” which really are stablecoins but of a different sort, pinned approximately to quantities other than fiat currencies. For example, the Cogito G-coin is pinned to a synthetic index that measures progress on improving the environment (e.g., global temperature). Tracercoins can be programmed to track transactions in whatever manner is required by law in the jurisdictions where they are used. But they are not trying to emulate the currency of any particular country, so they will not likely be regulated as strictly as fiat-pinned  stablecoins . Related:  Programming languages prevent mainstream DeFi Because the pegs for these tokens are synthetic, it’s less of a traumatic market-psychology issue if the tokens vary from their pegs a bit from time to time.  What we have here, then, are stores of value that are potentially better even than the U.S. dollar and other traditional financial assets, in terms of maintaining fundamental value as the world evolves … and that are much less volatile than BTC and other standard crypto assets because of the stabilization built into their tokenomics.  Coupled with modern blockchain efficiency optimizations, we also have a viable payment mechanism that is not tied to the currency of any one country. Crypto has the potential to fulfill its ambitious long-time aspirations including creating financial tokens serving as better value-stores and payment mechanisms than fiat currencies.  To realize this potential the community needs to set aside fears incurred by the various frauds, scams and badly-architected systems that have plagued the crypto world, and aggressively deploy the best tools at hand — such as fractional reserve-based algorithmic stabilization — in the service of creative designs aimed at the greater good.

binance,Markets,Crypto Options Market Has Become More 'Interdealer' Since FTX's Blowup: Paradigm,"The  collapse  of Sam-Bankman Fried's digital assets exchange, FTX, has had industry-wide ramifications, one of them being market makers increasing their share of crypto  options  trading volumes. As of Friday, the notional value of the month-to-date interdealer flow on the institutional-grade, over-the-counter (OTC) communications platform  Paradigm  was $633 million, or 43.5% of the total crypto options trading volume of $1,455 million. That's the highest since at least January this year. ""More buy-side takers (hedge funds/family offices/HNW) are sitting on the sidelines, and a higher proportion of Paradigm volumes is occurring between market makers,""  Paradigm tweeted , adding that the options market fells more ""interdealer"" than before FTX's meltdown. An options trade is said to be an interdealer trade when both the price taker and the price maker are market-making firms, that is entities with a contractual obligation to maintain a healthy level of liquidity on an exchange. Trading between dealers or interdealer trading is a common feature in most financial markets, particularly those dominated by institutions dealing in large orders. Price makers create orders and wait for them to be filled. In other words, they bring liquidity to the market. Takers remove liquidity from the market by taking available orders. The crypto market, like traditional finance, comprises the ""buy side"" and the ""sell side."" The buy side invests in assets and includes pension funds, mutual funds, institutional investors, hedge funds and retail investors. The sell side, which includes commercial banks, investment banks,  market makers , stockbrokers and other entities, is concerned with creating, promoting and issuing traded securities. While Paradigm is an OTC communications platform, its fortunes are closely tied to Deribit, the world's leading centralized crypto options exchange by trading volumes and open positions. Trades facilitated by Paradigm are automatically executed, margined and cleared at Deribit. Interdealer flows or trading between market makers now account for a higher-than-usual share of the total trading volume. (Paradigm) (Paradigm) The interdealer flow as the percentage of total volume on Paradigm has jumped to 43.5% in December from 30.4% in November. ""This can chalk up to buy-side clients closing books for the year, and still only halfway through the month, but a jump this high suggests a structural change,"" Amberdata's weekly options analytics note published Sunday, said. The structural change might be attributed to the high degree of uncertainty the collapse of FTX has injected into the market and  the unwillingness  among retail and investors to keep coins/funds on centralized exchanges. FTX  filed for bankruptcy  on Nov. 11, setting off a chain reaction that took down industry heavyweights like crypto lender  BlockFi  and brought extra scrutiny on leading exchange  Binance  and some of the oldest digital assets institutions, like  Grayscale . Grayscale is owned by Digital Currency Group, which is also the parent of CoinDesk. ""The main takeaway is that the supply-demand picture between the number of market-makers and the number of active-takers adding risk has definitely shifted more toward the supply of makers and less demand from takers,"" Joe Kruy, director of institutional coverage at Paradigm, said in a  Youtube interview  early this month. According to Kruy, the situation is likely to persist. ""Given the recent events, people are going to be sitting on their hands, waiting to see what happens. There is still potentially a lot of bodies that have yet to rise to the surface,"" Kruy said.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/19/crypto-options-market-has-become-more-interdealer-since-ftxs-blowup-paradigm/,coindesk,2022-12-19,10:26:00,en,557,3658,5.5350089766606825,211,0.37881508078994613,collapse bankman digital asset exchange ftx industry wide ramification market maker increasing share crypto option trading volume notional interdealer flow institutional grade counter otc communication platform paradigm total crypto option trading volume highest buy side taker fund family office hnw sitting sideline higher proportion paradigm volume occurring market maker paradigm tweeted adding option market fell interdealer ftx meltdown option trade interdealer trade taker maker market making firm entity contractual obligation maintain healthy level liquidity exchange trading dealer interdealer trading common feature financial market dominated institution dealing order maker create order wait filled word bring liquidity market taker remove liquidity market taking order crypto market traditional finance comprises buy side side buy side invests asset includes pension fund mutual fund institutional investor fund retail investor side includes commercial investment market maker stockbroker entity concerned creating promoting issuing traded security paradigm otc communication platform fortune closely tied deribit world leading centralized crypto option exchange trading volume open position trade facilitated paradigm automatically executed margined cleared deribit interdealer flow trading market maker account higher usual share total trading volume paradigm paradigm interdealer flow percentage total volume paradigm jumped chalk buy side client closing book halfway jump suggests structural change amberdata option analytics note published structural change attributed degree uncertainty collapse ftx injected market unwillingness retail investor coin fund centralized exchange ftx filed bankruptcy setting chain reaction industry heavyweight crypto lender blockfi brought extra scrutiny leading exchange binance oldest digital asset institution grayscale grayscale owned digital currency group coindesk takeaway supply demand picture number market maker number active taker adding risk shifted supply maker demand taker kruy director institutional coverage paradigm youtube interview kruy situation persist recent event people sitting hand waiting potentially lot body rise kruy,0.018939393939393943,positive,0.4272727272727272,"{'neg': 0.045, 'neu': 0.846, 'pos': 0.109, 'compound': 0.9413}",0.9413,0.045,0.846,0.109,positive,-0.42857139795918586,0.05426356568114897,negative

The breakdown could last until the price reaches the level that comes to be at the length equal to the triangle's maximum height. In other words, BNB's ascending triangle breakdown target is near $170, down about 30% from the current price levels, as shown below. The BNB/USD pair could drop to the said level by January 2023.

They eventually managed to swap the BNB tokens for 5 million USDC.

binance, News ," BNB Chain now has more unique addresses than Ethereum, developer says ","Unique addresses on the BNB Chain have now surpassed Ethereum, according to a Dec. 22 statement from the developer. BNB Chain has made significant strides in onboarding the next billion users into  #Web3  in 2022.  We want to thank our incredible community for coming along for the ride as we lay the groundwork for an even bigger year to come.  Further details ⤵️ https://t.co/9jNFdVeoZ3   pic.twitter.com/QjxL3ey759 — BNB Chain (@BNBCHAIN)  December 22, 2022 
 
 The developer  claims  that this makes BNB Chain “the largest layer 1 blockchain in the world.” However, blockchain data shows that the Bitcoin network is still larger than both BNB Chain and Ethereum. According  to Etherscan, Ethereum currently has over 217 million unique addresses. By contrast, BNB Chain has over 233 million unique addresses,  according  to BscScan. This implies that BNB Chain is larger than Ethereum as judged by this metric. On the other hand, the Bitcoin network  has  over 1 billion unique addresses, making it larger than both of these networks combined. The statement was made as part of BNB Chain’s “Year in Review.” The post also highlighted other significant milestones that the BNB network has reached over the past year. The network capped out at 9.8 million transactions per day in May and reached 2.2 million daily active users (DAUs) in October, with DAUs being defined as the number of unique addresses per day that interact with a smart contract. The developers credit the network’s success in 2022 to several initiatives implemented this year. The BNB Sidechain protocol allowed decentralized application (DApp) developers to run their DApps on separate shards of the network, reducing congestion and lowering transaction costs. Secondly, the team funded a builder grant and $10 million incentive program for DApp developers, which led to more DApps being created for BNB Chain and this, in turn, attracted more users. Additionally,  soulbound tokens were introduced , which allowed users to register wallet addresses for Know Your Customer (KYC) purposes by holding non-transferrable tokens in their wallets. The developers claim that this increased BNB Chain’s reputation in the nonfungible token and Web3 gaming community. Finally, the team credited its growth to the launch of Avenger DAO, an API that alerts users of BNB Chain whenever they interact with contracts flagged as malicious. In the team’s view, this made users feel more safe browsing the BNB network, leading to more user retention. Despite these successes, BNB Chain is still criticized by many in the blockchain community for  being too centralized . The post does mention that the network added 23 validators this year and plans to add 60 more in the coming months, which should help to make the network less centralized than it was before. By comparison, Ethereum  has over 400,000 validators .",https://cointelegraph.com/news/bnb-chain-now-has-more-unique-addresses-than-ethereum-developer-says,cointelegraph,2022-12-22,00:00:00,en,457,2870,5.236323851203501,172,0.37636761487964987,unique address bnb chain surpassed ethereum statement developer bnb chain made significant stride onboarding user web incredible community coming ride groundwork bigger detail http jnfdveoz pic twitter qjxl ey bnb chain bnbchain developer claim make bnb chain largest layer blockchain world blockchain data show bitcoin network larger bnb chain ethereum etherscan ethereum unique address contrast bnb chain unique address bscscan implies bnb chain larger ethereum judged metric bitcoin network unique address making larger network combined statement made part bnb chain review highlighted significant milestone bnb network reached past network capped transaction reached active user daus daus defined number unique address interact contract developer credit network success initiative implemented bnb sidechain protocol allowed decentralized application dapp developer run dapps separate shard network reducing congestion lowering transaction cost team funded builder incentive program dapp developer led dapps created bnb chain turn attracted user additionally soulbound token introduced allowed user wallet address customer kyc purpose holding transferrable token wallet developer claim increased bnb chain reputation nonfungible token web gaming community finally team credited growth launch avenger dao api alert user bnb chain interact contract flagged malicious team view made user feel safe browsing bnb network leading user retention success bnb chain criticized blockchain community centralized mention network added validators plan add coming month make network centralized comparison ethereum validators,0.23564814814814813,positive,0.6666666666666666,"{'neg': 0.019, 'neu': 0.816, 'pos': 0.166, 'compound': 0.9826}",0.9826,0.019,0.816,0.166,positive,-0.07692307100591762,0.06132075442773229,negative
binance,Markets,Binance Failing to Get US Exchange Listings for BNB Is Yellow Flag for Crypto Analysts,"Binance, the world’s biggest crypto exchange by trading volume, has been the  focus of crypto-market speculation  in recent weeks after blockchain watchers detected billions of dollars of  deposit outflows , the company’s  auditor begged off  and reports emerged the company might be under investigation by U.S. authorities. Such anxieties are clearly reflected in the recent downward trajectory for Binance’s in-house token,  BNB : The price has tumbled about 17% this month to $245, vastly underperforming the broad  CoinDesk Market Index  of digital assets, which is down 5.7%. At the peak in May 2021, BNB changed hands at $690, according to data from CoinMarketCap. The token’s market capitalization has dropped to around $40 billion, from a record $116 billion at one point last year. At the core of the concerns is whether Binance might be prone to a loss of confidence similar to November’s stunningly swift unraveling of Sam Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange. And it’s impossible to ignore that the first signs of deep distress at FTX emerged when that exchange’s own  FTT token started to plunge . So as crypto analysts home in on BNB token’s valuation, they’re scrutinizing the FTT token’s arc for any red – or yellow – flags that, in hindsight, might have tipped investors off to the market’s fragility. And a key similarity stands out: Just as FTX’s FTT token had mostly failed to get listed on major U.S. crypto exchanges, so is BNB absent from a large number of U.S. exchanges. (It is listed on  Binance.US .) Some crypto analysts speculate that major U.S. exchanges might have steered clear of a BNB listing for fear of running afoul of regulators. Any issues on the regulatory front could also represent a risk for holders of the token. “Exchanges probably do not list BNB as they see it as a security given the centralization of their network,” said Lucas Outumuro, head of research at IntoTheBlock, in an interview with CoinDesk. “It's probably not worth U.S. exchanges risking listing a security especially if it's a competitor's token.” FTT gets designated as a security The risk was underscored this week when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission  labeled FTX’s FTT token as a security  in a complaint. The  document  pointed to the existence of FTT's ""buy-and-burn"" program as an example of how the token might be intended to serve as an investment. Such programs might be compared to a stock buyback, where companies redeem their own shares from the open market to reduce the outstanding supply and thus to increase their value. Binance also offers a burn program, introduced in late 2021, labeled “ BNB Burn, ” and detailed on its website and updated as recently as Oct. 13. “BNB is a deflationary currency, which means that it maintains a stable value through burning its tokens throughout the year,” the website reads. According to Sean Farrell, head of digital asset strategy at Fundstrat, BNB is likely not listed on most domestic exchanges due to the fact it could be “deemed a security by regulators.” CoinDesk asked Binance for a comment on the lack of BNB token listings on major U.S. exchanges besides Binance.US, and also if executives at the firm were worried that it might be deemed a security. No response was received as of press time. In an earlier communication, the representative noted that BNB was listed on several major crypto exchanges outside the U.S. What the exchanges say According to Binance's website, ""BNB is the cryptocurrency coin that powers the BNB Chain ecosystem."" ""As one of the world's most popular utility tokens, not only can you trade BNB like any other cryptocurrency, you can also use BNB in a wide range of applications and use cases,"" the website reads. In terms of utility of the token, BNB can be used ""to pay for goods and services, settle transaction fees on Binance Smart Chain, participate in exclusive token sales and more,"" according to the site. A yellow button at the bottom of the web page reads, ""Buy BNB Now."" Clicking that leads to another  web page  where a user can log in to Binance or sign up for an account. According to  CoinGecko , the digital-asset markets pricing site, BNB is listed on tens of crypto exchanges, including KuCoin, Huobi and OKX. The U.S. exchange Kraken lists over 120 tokens but does not offer BNB to its customers. A Kraken spokesperson said to CoinDesk that “Kraken is an agnostic player in the crypto market” and that it “has a robust asset selection and listing procedure that ensures assets receive the analysis and vetting they deserve, which includes a rigorous compliance, legal and security process.” A representative for Coinbase, which also has not listed BNB, told CoinDesk, ""If we haven’t listed a popular asset yet, it is likely due to various reasons which may include: We have concluded that the asset does not meet our listing standards, we do not have enough information about the asset, additional technical integration work is required, or we do not support the network for the given token standard.” “BNB certainly is not in a position of strength, which will likely continue as thorny questions regarding Binance remain,” wrote Collin Howe, derivatives trader at B2C2 in a Friday note.",https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/12/23/crypto-analysts-see-yellow-flag-in-us-exchanges-refusal-to-list-binances-bnb-token/,coindesk,2022-12-23,21:14:00,en,874,5219,4.953089244851259,350,0.40045766590389015,binance world biggest crypto exchange trading volume focus crypto market speculation recent blockchain watcher detected billion dollar deposit outflow company auditor begged report emerged company investigation authority anxiety reflected recent downward trajectory binance token bnb tumbled vastly underperforming broad coindesk market index digital asset bnb changed hand data coinmarketcap token market capitalization dropped record point concern binance prone loss confidence similar stunningly unraveling bankman ftx exchange impossible ignore sign deep distress ftx emerged exchange ftt token started plunge crypto analyst home bnb token valuation scrutinizing ftt token arc yellow flag hindsight tipped investor market fragility similarity stand ftx ftt token failed listed crypto exchange bnb absent number exchange listed binance crypto analyst speculate exchange steered clear bnb listing fear running afoul regulator issue regulatory front represent risk holder token exchange list bnb security centralization network outumuro research intotheblock interview coindesk exchange risking listing security competitor token ftt designated security risk underscored security exchange commission labeled ftx ftt token security complaint document pointed existence ftt buy burn program token intended serve investment program compared buyback company redeem share open market reduce outstanding supply increase binance offer burn program introduced late labeled bnb burn detailed website updated recently bnb deflationary currency maintains stable burning token website read digital asset strategy fundstrat bnb listed domestic exchange due fact deemed security regulator coindesk asked binance comment lack bnb token listing exchange binance executive firm worried deemed security response received press time earlier communication representative noted bnb listed crypto exchange exchange binance website bnb cryptocurrency coin bnb chain ecosystem world popular utility token trade bnb cryptocurrency bnb wide application case website read term utility token bnb pay good service transaction fee binance chain participate exclusive token site yellow bottom web read buy bnb clicking lead web user log binance sign account coingecko digital asset market pricing site bnb listed ten crypto exchange including kucoin huobi okx exchange kraken list token offer bnb customer kraken spokesperson coindesk kraken agnostic crypto market robust asset selection listing procedure ensures asset receive analysis vetting deserve includes rigorous compliance legal security process representative coinbase listed bnb told coindesk listed popular asset due reason include concluded asset meet listing standard information asset additional technical integration work required support network token standard bnb position strength continue thorny question binance remain wrote derivative trader note,0.038452380952380946,positive,0.38059523809523815,"{'neg': 0.078, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.181, 'compound': 0.9907}",0.9907,0.078,0.741,0.181,positive,-0.28571427551020445,0.07932011308974472,negative
binance, Price Analysis ," Price analysis 12/26: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, XRP, DOGE, ADA, MATIC, DOT ","The cryptocurrency markets are  trading at record-low volatility  as investors have largely  stayed away during the holiday season . That could be because investors are unsure about the cryptocurrencies that could lead the next bull run. Cumberland senior research analyst Steven Goulden said in a “Year in Review” report that he expects four “emerging narratives” to  lead the crypto space  over the next six to 24 months. Goulden anticipates growth in nonfungible tokens, Web3 apps and games. He expects export-oriented nations to add Bitcoin ( BTC ) and Ether ( ETH ) as reserve assets and if that happens, it could be a huge positive. Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source:  Coin360 Jared Gross, head of institutional portfolio strategy at JPMorgan Asset Management, holds a different view. While speaking to Bloomberg, Gross said that the  bear market had broken the notion  that Bitcoin could act as a form of digital gold or an inflation hedge. He added that large institutional investors have stayed away from the crypto sector and that approach was unlikely to change anytime soon. Could the S&P 500 index (SPX) and the cryptocurrency sector witness a recovery in the next few days? Let’s study the charts to find out. SPX The S&P 500 index (SPX) turned down sharply from the downtrend line and tumbled below the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of 3,885 on Dec. 16. Buyers tried to push the price back above the 50-day SMA on Dec. 21, but the bears held their ground. SPX daily chart. Source: TradingView The sellers pulled the price below the immediate support of 3,795 on Dec. 22 but the long tail on the candlestick shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will again try to thrust the price above the moving averages and challenge the downtrend line. A break and close above the downtrend line could indicate a potential trend change. Contrarily, if the price turns down from the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) of 3,907, it will suggest that the bears continue to sell on rallies. The index could then drop below 3,764 and reach the next support at 3,650. DXY The U.S. dollar index (DXY) has been trading below 105 for the past few days. This suggests that the bears are trying to flip the 105 level into resistance. DXY daily chart. Source: TradingView Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory, indicating an advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and breaks below 103.44, the selling could pick up momentum and the index could plunge to 102 and later to the psychological level of 100. The bulls may vigorously defend this level. On the upside, the bulls will have to kick the price above the 20-day EMA of 105 to suggest that the selling pressure may be reducing. The index could then attempt a rally to 107 and subsequently to 108. The bears are likely to mount a strong defense at this level. BTC/USDT Bitcoin has been trading in a tiny range for the past few days. This indicates that traders are not clear about the next directional move, hence they may be sitting on the sidelines.  BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView This tight-range trading may not continue for long because traders thrive in a volatile market. Buyers will try to establish their supremacy by pushing the price above the moving averages and the resistance at $17,100. If they succeed, the BTC/Tether ( USDT ) pair could rally to $17,854 and then to the stiff resistance at $18,388. This level may act as a major obstacle and the bulls may find it difficult to surpass it. If the price turns down sharply from the current level and dips below $16,550, the bears will try to extend the decline to the $15,500 to $16,000 support zone. ETH/USDT The bears tried to pull Ether toward the $1,150 support on Dec. 25, but the long tail on the candlestick shows that the bulls are buying on minor dips. Buyers are currently attempting to catapult the price above the moving averages. ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView If they manage to do that, the ETH/USDT pair could pick up pace and rally to $1,352. This level could act as a major hurdle because the bears will try to defend it to the best of their ability. If the price turns down from $1,352, it will suggest that the pair could remain stuck inside a large range for some more time. If the price turns down sharply from the current level, it will enhance the prospects of a break below $1,150. The pair could then slide to $1,075 where buying may emerge. The flattish 20-day EMA of $1,227 and the RSI near 47 indicate a possible range-bound action in the near term. BNB/USDT The bears are aggressively defending the breakdown level of $250 but a minor positive is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the bulls will again try to propel BNB ( BNB ) above the overhead resistance zone between $250 and $255. BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView If they can pull it off, the BNB/USDT pair could quickly move up to the $290 to $300 resistance zone, which may act as a major barrier.  The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate an advantage to the bears. If the price turns down and breaks below $236, it will suggest that the bears have succeeded in flipping $250 into resistance. The pair could then drop to $220. If this level cracks, the pair could sink to the psychological level of $200.  XRP/USDT XRP ( XRP ) is trading inside a symmetrical triangle pattern. The price rebounded off the support line on Dec. 19 and reached the 20-day EMA of $0.36 on Dec. 26. XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView If the price turns down from the 20-day EMA, the bears will again attempt to sink the XRP/USDT pair below the support line. If they succeed, the pair could plunge to the pivotal support at $0.30.  Contrary to this assumption, if bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could rally to the resistance line. The bears may fiercely protect this level, but if the bulls overcome their resistance, the pair could start a strong recovery. The pair could first rally to $0.42 and then to the pattern target at $0.47. DOGE/USDT Dogecoin ( DOGE ) recovery from the strong support at $0.07 fizzled out at $0.08. This suggests that bears continue to sell on minor relief rallies. DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView The DOGE/USDT pair could trade between $0.07 and $0.08 for some time. The downsloping moving averages and the RSI in the negative territory indicate an advantage to the bears. If the price slips below $0.07, the selling could intensify and the pair may plummet to the critical support at $0.05.  This negative view could invalidate in the short term if bulls push and sustain the price above the 20-day EMA of $0.08. The pair could then attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $0.11. Related:  Bitcoin price volatility due within days, new take says as BTC flatlines at $16.8K ADA/USDT  Cardano ( ADA ) rebounded off the support line of the falling wedge pattern on Dec. 22 and the bulls are trying to push the price to the 20-day EMA of $0.27. ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView The bears will try to halt the recovery at the 20-day EMA and assert their supremacy. If the price turns down from this level, it will suggest that the trend remains negative and bears remain in command. The ADA/USDT pair could then retest the support at $0.25. If this level cracks, the pair may again drop to the support line. If bulls want to gain the upper hand, they will have to push the price above the 20-day EMA. The pair could then rally to the 50-day SMA of $0.31) and later to the downtrend line. MATIC/USDT Polygon ( MATIC ) has been oscillating inside a large range between $0.69 and $1.05 for the past several months. Many times, trading inside a range is random and volatile. MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView The MATIC/USDT pair rebounded off $0.76 on Dec. 19 and the bulls are trying to push the price to the 20-day EMA of $0.83. The bears are expected to sell the rally to the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from this level and breaks below $0.76, the pair could plummet to the strong support at $0.69. On the other hand, if the bulls drive the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could attempt a rally to the overhead resistance at $0.97. DOT/USDT Polkadot ( DOT ) remains in a strong downtrend. The bulls are trying to protect the support at $4.37 but the shallow bounce increases the likelihood of the continuation of the down move.  DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingView The bears will try to strengthen their position by pulling the price below $4.37. If they do that, the DOT/USDT pair could resume the downtrend. The pair could thereafter reach $4 where the buyers may again try to arrest the decline. In a downtrend, the bears generally sell the relief rallies to the 20-day EMA of $4.80. The bulls will have to clear this hurdle to suggest that the downward momentum could be weakening. The pair could then rise to the 50-day SMA of $5.30 and later to $6.
